# Banned from /r/FanEdit Subreddit for accusation of piracy.

Within the 2nd day of posting my fanedits I got perm banned, and they won't let me appeal.
I can prove my copies weren't pirated. In fact I discuss buying the Spiritual Edition DVD from Ebay, which is allowed.
The deletion of my Sonic Trilogy edit was so blatant I had to wonder if they admins were doing the bidding of the hecklers,
since they followed the heckler's extreme interpretation of racism in hollywood movies as some kind of conspiracy theory.
But this ban over piracy without asking me for a copy or checking with me at all is more than blatant -
it's systematic, like the Combine-style destruction of Gaza. Alrighty then!
Now I see how locked-down the forum/discord/reddit channels are.
I figure there are industry agents at work here. I don't think that's much of a conspiracy really.
As hollywood continues to get worse, they are more afraid that we will eventually compete with them.
They don't even want us making edits. That much is clear.
