All [technological advances](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/science-technology/developments-in-airplanes-between-world-war-one-and-world-war-two-fall-2012)
in Human History have coincided with acts of war. 1914 saw both the makings of a World War and the advent of small
bombers like the [Voisin III](https://www.historyhit.com/18-key-bomber-aircraft-from-world-war-one/) which was capable
of carrying up to 60kg of bombs. 1938 saw the introduction of massive air ships like
the [Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress#Initial_orders) leading up
to World War II. There is [no doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II) that both wars
were decided in the air, not on the ground.

**Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Great Wars of the 20th century were perpetuated through international
conglomerates like the Boeing Corporation.**

### Q: You're saying airplane corporations like _Boeing_ caused WW1 & WW2?

Regardless of who caused the Great War, it was bulky cargo jets like Boeing's B Series (B17, B24, B29, B52...)
that [decided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wjgl1j8-jg?t=30) it. The idea was to carry a payload of 10s of thousands
of pounds of napalm or white phosphorus munitions, travel many hundreds of miles, and then drop the payload on the
target. Of course we know the Germans had the same technology. What they did _not have_ was the willingness to do to
their enemies what their enemies were willing to do to them: **rain gasoline
and [fenian fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus_munitions) upon countless men, women, and children** in
another country from the air, burning them all
alive. [Saturated air bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II) decided WW2. I bet
you didn't know we [firebombed](http://www.ditext.com/japan/napalm.html) no less than 67 cities in Japan before they
finally surrendered. After the victory of WW2, the coalition bombings continued -
spanning [66 years of campaigns](https://www.globalresearch.ca/list-of-countries-the-usa-has-bombed-since-the-end-of-world-war-ii/24626)
in over 32 countries.

### Q: Okay, so how did they get Allied pilots to bomb men women and children?

Two things: By employing [children soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children_in_World_War_II)
and [suppressed technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy#Space_travel_and_gravitational_shielding)

### Q: Why do children matter?

Using children was the only way the Allies could convince actual air-force pilots to get into the planes and send them
hundreds of miles on deadly bombing raids, only to drop gel napalm or WP on children they never met. One well-known
example of forcing children into suicide in order to stage a war is the
so-called [Kamikaze Pilot](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/619508.html). We now know from recently recovered
pilot letters
that [Child Kamikazes](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/11/09/the-myth-of-the-kamikaze-pilot) were
_unwilling_ employed to [manufacture](https://www.ibiblio.org/pha/myths/Missing_Carriers.html)
the [Pearl Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory) event.

Armed with this _automated_ unstoppable destructive combination, the Allies were able to win WW2 by brute force alone.
Jumbo jet bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped napalm and other
incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. **Had the Allies attempted to fight WW2 honorably, we
would not have used _children_ and we wouldn't have used _napalm_** (
or [Willy Pete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_phosphorus#White_phosphorus)...). The Allies would have
tried to convince our own adult pilots of the necessity of committing genocide against an enemy population oversees.
Those pilots would be well aware of the technology by the end of the war, and would have wanted to use ZPE (and other
technology) to build a peaceful new world. We might have been flying our
own [ZPE Porsche HLS](https://files.paradigmthreat.net/science/anti_gravity/antigrav_porsche_hls.jpg)'s today. Instead
of that future, we were benefacted this coal-powered, earth-bound, global technocracy. This is what _world domination_
looks like: Airports!  
(Fun Fact: The history of allied bombing raids using child pilots became the inspiration behind the book Ender's Game,
where essentially an entire war is fought using children and technology.)

The Allies gave their enemies a simple choice between complete surrender and complete destruction. As a result, Germany,
Japan, Italy, North Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and Libya were completely destroyed by our bombers.
Any country that surrendered (allowing in the central bank) _didn't_ receive a bombing campaign, and instead got
airports and industrialization as a reward. This is
why [we](https://www.usafe.af.mil/News/Press-Releases/Article/1877377/air-force-strategic-bombers-support-exercises-in-europe/)
keep running live
bombing [simulations](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28572/b-52-bomber-made-run-straight-at-russian-occupied-crimea-during-long-range-mission)
upon countries we have poor relations with. It's an effective threat.

### Children coerced into warfare:

"School based propaganda dates back to 1917 when President Wilson commissioned the nation’s first governmental
propaganda agency, the Committee on Public Information (CPI). Schools were targeted because they were a way to reach a
large population and carefully crafted messages could be disseminated to both educators and students thus engineering
consensus on key governmental policies related to the war. Wilson’s strategy was highly successful in gaining support
for the war and established a precedent for the use of educational propaganda during military conflicts."

"The same trend held true during the Great Depression, and a breakdown in child labor law enforcement occurred. Studies
indicated the number of 14- and 15-year-old workers in the shirt industry had spiked. Thirteen-year-olds were working in
Pennsylvania coal mines. Another study revealed that children younger than 11 slaved over piecework in their homes,
earning less than $.10 an hour."

"By publishing their letters, the author shows that in general kamikazes were not consenting, and that the higher levels

objective (an enemy ship), but not to return."

“In spite of the risk involved, however, in letting the Japanese fire the first shot , we realized that in order to have
the full support of the American people, it was desirable to make sure that the Japanese be the ones to do this, so that

announced policy of the Army Air Force that it engaged only in precision bombing against military targets and did not
attack civilians."

"Several thousand missile and bombing raids were carried out over Yugoslavia during the NATO aggression. Several tens of
thousands of bombs and missiles were dropped with a total weight of more than 22,000 tons. A large number of historical

than 20 hospitals. Nearly 40,000 homes were completely destroyed or damaged."

approximately 100,000 civilians in a single night. Almost 270,000 buildings were destroyed"
