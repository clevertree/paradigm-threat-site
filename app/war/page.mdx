## Q: Are the inventors of jumbo jets lying to the world?

Well, _History Repeats!_ So lets take a closer look.
All [technological advances](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/science-technology/developments-in-airplanes-between-world-war-one-and-world-war-two-fall-2012)
in Human History have coincided with acts of war. 1914 saw both the makings of a World War and the advent of small
bombers like the [Voisin III](https://www.historyhit.com/18-key-bomber-aircraft-from-world-war-one/) which was capable
of carrying up to 60kg of bombs. 1938 saw the introduction of massive air ships like
the [Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress#Initial_orders) leading up
to World War II.
There should be no doubt that both
[World War 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_I)
and [World War 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II)
were decided in the air, not on the ground.

**Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Great Wars of the 20th century were perpetuated through international
conglomerates like the Boeing Corporation.**

## Q: You're saying airplane corporations like _Boeing_ caused WW1 & WW2?

Regardless of who caused World War 2, it was bulky cargo jets like Boeing's B Series (B17, B24, B29, B52...) that
[decided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wjgl1j8-jg?t=30) it. The idea was to carry a payload of
10s of thousands of pounds of napalm or white phosphorus munitions, travel many hundreds of miles,
and then drop the payload on the target. Of course we know the Germans had the same technology.
What they did _not have_ was the willingness to do to their enemies what their enemies were willing to do to them:
**rain gasoline and [fenian fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus_munitions) upon countless
men, women, and children** in another country from the air, burning them all alive.
[Saturated air bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II) decided WW2.
Did you know
we [firebombed no less than 67 cities](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/15/bombing-dresden-war-crime)
in Japan before they _finally surrendered_?

> As the incendiaries fell, the phosphorus clung to the bodies of those below, turning them into human torches.
> The screaming of those who were being burned alive was added to the cries of those not yet hit.
> There was no need for flares to lead the second wave of bombers to their target, **as the whole city had become a
gigantic torch**.
> It must have been visible to the pilots from a hundred miles away. Dresden had no defences, no anti-aircraft guns, no

After the victory of WW2, the coalition bombings continued - spanning
[66 years of campaigns](https://www.globalresearch.ca/list-of-countries-the-usa-has-bombed-since-the-end-of-world-war-ii/24626)
in over 32 countries.

## Q: Okay, so how did they get Allied pilots to bomb men women and children?

The Allies cheated by employing
[children pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children_in_World_War_II),
[gyroscopic automatic pilot](https://www.history.com/news/plane-automation-autopilot-flight-302-610),
[ZPE Electro-Gravitic Thrusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy#Space_travel_and_gravitational_shielding)
,
and [Napalm/Phosphorus Munitions](https://cstms.berkeley.edu/current-events/napalm-in-world-war-ii-invention-test-the-bat-bomb-and-incinerating-japan/)
.

## Q: Which suppressed technology?

<PopImage {...require("../conspiracy/anti_gravity/antigrav_research2.jpg?w=600")}
          alt="Anti Gravity Research 4"
          className="rounded-md m-auto"/>


The universe is [electric](/cosmology/electric_universe) in nature.
Therefore,
electromagnetic [zero-point-energy](http://www.zpenergy.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2938&mode=thread&order=1&thold=0)
technology is possible. The force of electromagnetism is
[10\^39](https://principia-scientific.org/electromagnetic-gravity-examination-of-the-electric-universe-theory/)
stronger than the force of Earth's Gravity, making "anti-gravity" technology trivial and easy to design.
This principle can be easily demonstrated with [electromagnets](https://education.jlab.org/qa/electromagnet_is.html).
The Great War exposed this technology for the first time, but built it into the planes in such a way that their
own pilots and engineers could not detect it. The planes became automated with all pilot decisions replaced by machines.
Thus, the Boeing Bombers could be piloted by a child of any age.

## Q: Why do children matter?

Using children was the only way the Allies could convince actual air-force pilots to get into the planes and send them
hundreds of miles on deadly bombing raids,
only to drop gel napalm or WP on children they never met.
One well-known example of forcing children into suicide in order to stage a war is the
so-called [Kamikaze Pilot](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/619508.html).
We now know from recently recovered pilot letters
that [Child Kamikazes](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/11/09/the-myth-of-the-kamikaze-pilot)
were _unwilling_ employed to [manufacture](https://www.ibiblio.org/pha/myths/Missing_Carriers.html)
the [Pearl Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory) event.

Armed with this _automated_ unstoppable destructive combination, the Allies were able to win WW2 by brute force alone.
Jumbo jet bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped napalm and other
incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages.
**Had the Allies attempted to fight WW2 honorably, we would not have used _children_ and we wouldn't have used _
napalm_**
(or [Willy Pete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_phosphorus#White_phosphorus)...).
The Allies would have tried to convince our own adult pilots of the necessity of committing genocide against an enemy
population oversees.
Those pilots would be well aware of the technology by the end of the war, and would have wanted to use ZPE (and other
technology) to build a peaceful new world.
We might have been flying our
own [ZPE Porsche HLS](https://files.paradigmthreat.net/science/anti_gravity/antigrav_porsche_hls.jpg)'s today.
Instead of that future, we were benefacted this **coal-powered, earth-bound, global technocracy**.
This is what world domination looks like;
identical airports throughout the globe enabling and maintaining the technocratic **Deep State** empire.
(Fun War Fact: The history of allied bombing raids using child pilots became the inspiration behind the
book [Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game#Synopsis),
where essentially _an entire war is fought using unwilling children and deceptive technology resulting in the
annihilation of a manufactured enemy_.)

## Q: World domination via Airports? HuH?

The Allies gave their enemies a simple choice between complete surrender and complete destruction.
As a result, Germany, Japan, Italy, North Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and Libya were completely
destroyed by our bombers.
Any country that surrendered (allowing in the central bank) _didn't_ receive a bombing campaign, and instead got
airports and industrialization as a reward.
This is
why [we](https://www.usafe.af.mil/News/Press-Releases/Article/1877377/air-force-strategic-bombers-support-exercises-in-europe/)
keep running live
bombing [simulations](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28572/b-52-bomber-made-run-straight-at-russian-occupied-crimea-during-long-range-mission)
upon countries we have poor relations with. It's an effective threat.

## Q: What flying machines (besides saucers) use this flying technology?

Small helicopters, stunt planes and RC model toy planes do _not_ need ZPE technology to fly,
but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B24, B29..) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited
weight) in bombs.
**All passenger jets use ZPE electro-gravitic thrusters** to both reduce the effect of gravity upon the plane as well as
stabilize the flight itself.
_It is for this reason that a Jumbo Jet can fly with a wing of engines disabled without rotating towards the dragging
wing (and immediately dropping out of the sky)._
ZPE / ElectroGravitic technology has both a vertical thrusting effect and a horizontal stabilizing effect on a craft.
It's a flawless technology that provides any craft with the ability to sustain normal flight in the event of a
catastrophic multi engine failure.

## Q: Sooooo.... why did that Boeing Crash then?

If planes cannot ever crash, if they have a secret technology that keeps them from ever crashing,
then what about all the plane crashes in the news? There is only one _Ex-Plane-Ation_ left if you rule out mechanical or
pilot failure.
**The plane crashes are simulated.**
Here's how:

First, your target plane _Flight123_ is chosen for a scheduled crash.
The plane takes off and a crash is scheduled for right after takeoff, or somewhere within the trip.
When the moment of the crash comes, Flight123 goes dark. It loses communication with all controllers
and the pilots lose control of the craft. It becomes fully automated. At this exact same moment,
Flight123b goes live. What is Flight123b? It is an identical aircraft, completely empty of passengers and pilots,
flying nearby (within 10-50 miles). Get it?

Now, Flight123b does not communicate with the controllers. Instead, it is immediately shot out of the sky,
or has a scheduled mechanical failure. It crashes. There are videos. Finally Boeing employees arrive
to bulldoze the crash site and erase all evidence, crushing victims bones. Right? Wrong. Flight123,
the REAL flight, with the actual passengers and pilots has landed safely in a remote location,
an airport you and I have never heard of. Classified. Now, we all know how this story Ends.
Boeing convinces all families to settle for $X,XXX,XXX. But what is the real reason these
families are historically okay with taking money for the lives of their loved ones?

Because they didn't.

The family members are released to their families when, _and only when_,
they have all signed their right to discuss the crash away for the rest of their lives.
Cooperative or not, the families have absolutely no way to fight back against a lawless international conglomerate.
I would imagine the most uncooperative families are made aware that only by their own actions would they *actually* have
lost someone in the crash.
Would you trade your son, daughter, wife, husband's life for the truth? Yes. Yes you would.

## Q: Okay so, how does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time?

Lots of ways. Here's some:

* 1\. You _can not_ get an aviators license without _direct approval_ by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test
proving that you 'understand' (believe in) aerodynamics heavier-than-air flight. This separation from the public
results in people having a church-like faith in airplanes or complete fear in them.
* 2\. Everyone knows that NASA has always been corrupt and inaccessible to women and minorities; a pseudoscience _boys
club_ run like a giga-church, but most people don't know NASA was created entirely in-house
by [Lockheed Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_Space_Systems) and Boeing. This martial-religious
centralization is designed to keep outsiders (us) from getting too close to the industry secrets.
* 3\. Jet Propulsion Labs (JPL) insists only jets are capable of propulsion needed for space travel, even though ion (
EM) thrusters have been used in space probes since 1964.
* 4\. Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 _YEARS_. The identical design shared by all plane manufacturers
is a result of their development always being in secret.
Example: [AirBus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Airbus#Development_of_the_A380).
* 5\. [Jumbo jet terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories#No-planes_theory) justified further
locking airports and flying technology.
* 6\. Suppressing of technology at the government and media level is the explanation for
all [UFO](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7679-0627-2) sightings.
Sorry, [bug-like aliens](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/05/28/forced-faked-alien-abductions-were-conducted-by-the-cia-according-to-renowned-researcher/)
was a psyop to hide suppressed technology.
* 7\. Science Fiction movies (like _The Incredibles_) constantly put in references to real suppressed technology to
associate that technology with science fiction.
* 8\. Suppressing of technology explains the ChemTrails phenomenon as no human pilots would be required to pull it off
world-wide. **Fully automated unmanned craft are responsible for all ChemTrails**.
* 9\. Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombed instead of airports. Napalm, specifically. Sometimes
Willie Pete. I'm not sure which is scarier.

**By Endless War**. The 20th Century was our darkest century and we were all born in it's shadow. That same darkness and
fear is felt today, preventing us from finding our way.

### Children coerced into warfare:

"School based propaganda dates back to 1917 when President Wilson commissioned the nation’s first governmental
propaganda agency, the Committee on Public Information (CPI). Schools were targeted because they were a way to reach a
large population and carefully crafted messages could be disseminated to both educators and students thus engineering
consensus on key governmental policies related to the war. Wilson’s strategy was highly successful in gaining support
for the war and established a precedent for the use of educational propaganda during military conflicts."

"The same trend held true during the Great Depression, and a breakdown in child labor law enforcement occurred. Studies
indicated the number of 14- and 15-year-old workers in the shirt industry had spiked. Thirteen-year-olds were working in
Pennsylvania coal mines. Another study revealed that children younger than 11 slaved over piecework in their homes,
earning less than $.10 an hour."

"TNT could have been used to fabricate any A-Bomb test. And yes, conventional bombs can and do produce the classic
mushroom clouds that we routinely associate with atomic bombs."

"In the early hours of March 10, 1945, 279 US B-29s then dropped 1.665 tons of napalm bombs on Tokyo, killing
approximately 100,000 civilians in a single night. Almost 270,000 buildings were destroyed"

### Suppressed Technology in the 20th Century:

"a 'zero point' of gravity exists in the universe and can be replicated here on Earth. The pressure to be the first
nation to harness gravity is immense, as it means having the ability to build military planes of unlimited speed and
range, along with the most deadly weaponry the world has ever seen. The ideal shape for a gravity-defying vehicle
happens to be a perfect disk, making antigravity tests a possible explanation for the numerous UFO sightings of the past
50 years."

"We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it
would take an Act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity...Anything you can imagine, we already know how to
do." -Ben Rich, stated during a 1993, Alumni Speech at UCLA

"Also known as ElectroGravitics, the idea is said to be an anti-gravity force created by an electric field’s effect on a
mass."

A Jumbo Jet Aircraft like the 747-400 stores it's fuel in 3-5 tanks within the wings. This of course make no sense, as
the plane could have been designed with fuel tanks elsewhere. The essential design of any ZPE electrogravitic module is
a large, circular apparatus with a rotating EM emitter inside which rotates counter to the earth's EM field.
Such a device can be easily hidden within the body of any plane, however, the most ideal location would be within the
jet engines themselves which are already designed with a super fast rotating turbine disks.

"Can The Airbus A380 Fly On One Engine?" Yes, but this article fails to explain how.
[https://simpleflying.com/one-engine-a380/](https://simpleflying.com/one-engine-a380/)
Here's how: If electro-gravitic thrusters are built horizontally into the wings, then yes, the plane should be able to
sustain lift with one (or even zero) engines still running.
Can hollow metal wings lift a plane using wind alone? **No.**

When jet engines fail, the passengers feel no drop. Just like in LoonyToons! <small>(Fun fact: 6 months after I posted
this article, the pilot of the Hudson Miracle Landing died. Guess I can't interview him now...)</small>
"It was a very foreign feeling - the plane actually shuddered and kind of stopped in mid-air," said one passenger.

"As the flight was over the Aegean Sea and 100 nautical miles northeast of Athens, Greece, the left-hand engine
experienced a spontaneous shut down. The crew responded to this occurrence by decreasing its altitude from FL360 to
FL240\. The flight continued at this altitude until landing without further incident – two hours and 20 minutes
later."

### Unexplainable aerodynamics:

"An unbelievable feature of gliding performance is the effect of airplane gross weight. Since the maximum lift-drag
ratio of a given airplane is an intrinsic property of the aerodynamic configuration, **gross weight will not affect the
gliding performance**."

"Beginning in late 1965, a number of B-52Ds underwent Big Belly modifications to increase bomb capacity for carpet
bombings. The modification created enough capacity for a total of 60,000 lb (27,215 kg) using 108 bombs. Thus modified,
B-52Ds could carry 22,000 lb (9,980 kg) more than B-52Fs"

extra-terrestrials.
