PREFACE
Worlds in Collision is a book of wars in the celestial sphere that took place in historical times. In
these wars the planet earth participated too. This book describes two acts of a great drama: one
that occurred thirty-four to thirty-five centuries ago, in the middle of the second millennium
before the present era; the other in the eighth and the beginning of the seventh century before the
present era, twenty-six centuries ago. Accordingly, this volume consists of two parts, preceded
by a prologue.
Harmony or stability in the celestial and terrestrial spheres is the point of departure of the
present-day concept of the world as expressed in the celestial mechanics of Newton and the
theory of evolution of Darwin. If these two men of science are sacrosanct, this book is a heresy.
However, modern physics, of atoms and of the quantum theory, describes dramatic changes in
the microcosm— the atom—the prototype of the solar system; a theory, then, that envisages not
dissimilar events in the macrocosm—the solar system-brings the modern concepts of physics to
the celestial sphere.
This book is written for the instructed and uninstructed alike. No formula and no hieroglyphic
will stand in the way of those who set out to read it. If, occasionally, historical evidence does not
square with formulated laws, it should be remembered that a law is but a deduction from
experience and experiment, and therefore laws must conform with historical facts, not facts with
laws.
The reader is not asked to accept a theory without question. Rather, he is invited to consider for
himself whether he is reading a book of fiction or non-fiction, whether what he is reading is
invention or historical fact. On one point alone, not necessarily decisive for the theory of cosmic
catastrophism, I borrow credence: I use a synchronical scale of Egyptian and Hebrew histories
which is not orthodox.
It was in the spring of 1940 that I came upon the idea that in the days of the Exodus, as evident
from many passages of the Scriptures, there occurred a great physical catastrophe, and that such
an event could serve in determining the time of the Exodus in Egyptian history or in establishing
a synchronical scale for the histories of the peoples concerned. Thus I started Ages in Chaos, a
reconstruction of the history of the ancient world from the middle of the second millennium
before the present era to the advent of Alexander the Great. Already in the fall of that same year,
1940, I felt that I had acquired an understanding of the real nature and extent of that catastrophe,
and for nine years I worked on both projects, the political and the natural histories. Although
Ages in Chaos was finished first, in the order of publication it will follow this work.
Worlds in Collision comprises only the last two acts of the cosmic drama. A few earlier acts—
one of them known as the Deluge—will be the subject of another volume of natural history.
The historical-cosmological story of this book is based on the evidence of historical texts of
many peoples around the globe, on classical literature, on epics of northern races, on sacred
books of the peoples of the Orient and Occident, on traditions and folklore of primitive peoples,
on old astronomical inscriptions and charts, on archaeological finds, and also on geological and
paleontological material.
If cosmic upheavals occurred in the historical past, why does not the human race remember
them, and why was it necessary to carry on research to find out about them? I discuss this
problem in the Section "The Collective Amnesia." The task I had to accomplish was not unlike
that faced by a psychoanalyst who, out of disassociated memories and dreams, reconstructs a
forgotten traumatic experience in the early life of an individual. In an analytical experiment on
mankind, historical inscriptions and legendary motifs often play the same role as recollections
(infantile memories) and dreams in the analysis of a personality.
Can we, out of this polymorphous material, establish actual facts? We shall check one people
against another, one inscription against another, epics against charts, geology against legends,
until we are able to extract the historical facts.
In a few cases it is impossible to say with certainty whether a record or a tradition refers to one
or another catastrophe that took place through the ages; it is also probable that in some traditions

robin-bobin

various elements from different ages are fused together. In the final analysis, however, it is not
so essential to segregate definitively the records of single world catastrophes. More important, it
seems, is to establish (1) that there were physical upheavals of a global character in historical
times; (2) that these catastrophes were caused by extraterrestrial agents; and (3) that these agents
can be identified.
There are many implications that follow from these conclusions. I refer to them in the Epilogue,
so that I can omit reference to them here.
A few readers went over this book in manuscript and made valuable suggestions and remarks. In
chronological order of their reading they are:
Dr. Horace M. Kallen, formerly Dean of the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social
Research, New York; John J. O'Neill, Science Editor of the New York Herald Tribune; James
Putnam, Associate Editor of the Macmillan Company; Clifton Fadiman, literary critic and
commentator; Gordon A. Atwater, Chairman and Curator of the Hayden Planetarium of the
American Museum of Natural History, New York. The last two read the work at their own
request after Mr. O'Neill had discussed it in an article in the Herald Tribune of August 11,1946. I
am indebted to all of them but I alone am responsible for content and form.
Miss Marion Kuhn cleared the manuscript of grammatical weeds and helped in reading the
proofs.
Many an author has dedicated his book to his wife or mentioned her in the preface. I have always
felt this was somewhat ostentatious, but now that this work is being published, I feel I shall be
most ungrateful if I fail to mention that my wife Elisheva spent almost as much time on it at our
desk as I did. I dedicate this book to her.
The years when Ages in Chaos and Worlds in Collision were written were years of a world
catastrophe created by man—of war that was fought on land, on sea, and in the air. During that
time man learned how to take apart a few of the bricks of which the universe is built—the atoms
of uranium. If one day he should solve the problem of the fission and fusion of the atoms of
which the crust of the earth or its water and air are composed, he may perchance, by initiating a
chain reaction, take this planet out of the struggle for survival among the members of the
celestial sphere. New York, September 1949.

CHAPTER 1
In an Immense Universe
Quota pars opens tanti nobis committitur?
—Seneca
IN AN immense universe a little globe revolves around a star; it is the third in the row—
Mercury, Venus, Earth—of the planetary family. It is of a solid core covered over most of its
surface with liquid, and it has a gaseous envelope. Living creatures fill the liquid; other living
creatures fly in the gas; and still others creep and walk upon the ground on the bottom of the
gaseous ocean. Man, a being of erect stature, thinks himself the prince of creation. He felt like
this long before he, by his own efforts, came to know how to fly on wings of metal around the
globe. He felt godlike long before he could talk to his fellow-man on the other side of the globe.
Today he can see the microcosm in a drop and the elements in the stars. He knows the laws
governing the living cell with its chromosomes, and the laws governing the macrocosm of the
sun, moon, planets, and stars. He assumes that gravitation keeps the planetary system together,
man and beast on their planet, the sea within its borders. For millions and millions of years, he
maintains, the planets have rolled along on the same paths, and their moons around them, and
man in these eons has arisen from a one-cell infusorium all the long way up the ladder to his
status of Homo sapiens.
Is man's knowledge now nearly complete? Are only a few more steps necessary to conquer the
universe: to extract the energy of

the atom—since these pages were written this has already been done —to cure cancer, to control
genetics, to communicate with other planets and learn if they have living creatures, too?
Here begins Homo ignoramus. He does not know what life is or how it came to be and whether it
originated from inorganic matter. He does not know whether other planets of this sun or of other
suns have life on them, and if they have, whether the forms of life there are like those around us,
ourselves included. He does not know how this solar system came into being, although he has
built up a few hypotheses about it. He knows only that the solar system was constructed billions
of years ago. He does not know what this mysterious force of gravitation is that holds him and
his fellow man on the other side of the planet with their feet on the ground, although he regards
the phenomenon itself as "the law of laws." He does not know what the earth looks like five
miles under his feet. He does not know how mountains came into existence or what caused the
emergence of the continents, although he builds hypotheses about these, nor does he know from
where oil came— again hypotheses. He does not know why, only a short time ago, a thick
glacial sheet pressed upon most of Europe and North America, as he believes it did; nor how
palms could grow above the polar circle, nor how it came about that the same fauna fill the inner
lakes of the Old and the New World. He does not know where the salt in the sea came from.
Although man knows that he has lived on this planet for millions of years, he finds a recorded
history of only a few thousand years. And even these few thousand years are not sufficiently well
known.
Why did the Bronze Age precede the Iron Age even though iron is more widely distributed over
the world and its manufacture is simpler than that of the alloy of copper and tin? By what
mechanical means were structures of immense blocks built on the high mountains of the Andes?
What caused the legend of the Flood to originate in all the countries of the world? Is there any
adequate meaning to the term "antediluvian"? From what experiences grew the eschatological
pictures of the end of the world?
WORLDS IN COLLISION

In this work, of which the present book is the first part, some of these questions will be
answered, but only at the cost of giving up certain notions now regarded as sacred laws in

robin-bobin

science—the millions of years of the present constitution of the solar system and the harmonious
revolution of the earth—with all their implications as regards the theory of evolution.
The Celestial Harmony
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. The day consists of twenty-four hours. The year
consists of 365 days, 5 hours, and 49 minutes. The moon circles around the earth, changing its
phases-crescent, full, decrescent. The terrestrial axis points in the direction of the polar star.
After winter comes spring, then summer and fall. These are common facts. Are they invariable
laws? Must it be so forever? Was it so always?
The sun has nine planets. Mercury has no satellites; Venus has no satellites; the earth has a
moon; Mars has two small trabants, mere pieces of rock, and one of them completes its month
before Mars ends its day; Jupiter has eleven moons and eleven different kinds of months to
count; Saturn has nine moons, Uranus has five moons,1 Neptune one, Pluto none.2 Was it
always so? Will it be so forever?
The sun rotates in an easterly direction. All planets revolve in their orbits in the same direction
(counterclockwise if seen from the north) around the sun. Most of their moons revolve
counterclockwise (in direct motion), but there are a few that revolve in the opposite direction (in
retrograde motion).
No orbit is an exact circle; there is no regularity in the eccentrical shapes of the planetary orbits;
each elliptical curve verges in a different direction.
It is not known for certain, but it is assumed that Mercury permanently shows the same face to
the sun, as our moon does with respect
1 The fifth satellite of Uranus was discovered in 1948.
2 Due to the great distance of Neptune and Pluto from the earth, smaller satellites around
these planets may have remained undiscovered.
Note: While this book was on the press another satellite of Neptune was discovered by G. P.
Kuiper.

WORLDS IN COLLISION
to the earth. Information obtained by different methods of observation of Venus is contradictory;
it is not known whether Venus rotates so slowly that its day equals its year, or so rapidly that the
night side is never sufficiently cooled. Mars rotates in 24 hours, 37 minutes, 22.6 seconds (mean
period), a period comparable to the terrestrial day. Jupiter, which in volume is thirteen hundred
times larger than the earth, completes a rotation in the short space of 9 hours and 50 minutes.
What causes this variability? It is not a law that a planet must rotate or have days and nights; still
less that its day and night must return every twenty-four hours.
If Pluto rotates from east to west,3 it has the sun rising in the west. Uranus has the sun rising and
setting neither in the east nor in the west. So it is not a law that a planet of the solar system must
rotate from west to east and that the sun must rise in the east.
The equator of the earth is inclined to the plane of its ecliptic at an angle of 23M°; this causes the
change of seasons during the annual revolution around the sun. The axes of other planets point in
the directions of seemingly deliberate choice. It is not a general law for all planets that winter
must follow fall and summer the spring.
The axis of Uranus is placed almost in the plane of its orbit; for about twenty years one of its
polar regions is the hottest place on the planet. Then night gradually descends and twenty years
later the other pole enters the tropics for an equal length of time.4
The moon has no atmosphere. It is not known whether Mercury has any atmosphere. Venus is
covered with dense clouds, but not of water vapor. Mars has a transparent atmosphere, but
almost without oxygen or water vapor, and its composition is unknown. Jupiter and Saturn have
gaseous envelopes; it is not known whether they have solid cores. It is not a general law that a
planet must have atmosphere or water.
Mars is 0.15 of the volume of the earth; the next planet, Jupiter, is about 8,750 times as large as
Mars. There is no regularity of, or relation between, the size of the planets and their position in
the system.

earth has reflecting oceans; Venus has brilliant clouds; Jupiter has belts and a red spot; Saturn
has rings.
The celestial harmony is composed of bodies different in size, different in form, different in the
velocity of rotation, with differently directed axes of rotation, with different directions of
rotation, with differently composed atmospheres or without atmospheres, with a varying number
of moons or without moons, and with satellites revolving in either direction.
It appears then to be by chance that the earth has a moon, that we have day and night and that
their combined length is equal to twenty-four hours, that we have a sequence of seasons, that we
have oceans and water, atmosphere and oxygen, and probably also that our planet is placed
between Venus at our left and Mars at our right.
The Origin of the Planetary System
All theories of the origin of the planetary system and the motive forces that sustain the motion of
its members go back to the gravitational theory and the celestial mechanics of Newton. The sun
attracts the planets, and if it were not for a second force, they would fall into the sun; but each
planet is impelled by a motive force to proceed in a direction away from the sun, and as a result,
an orbit is formed. Similarly, a satellite or a moon is subject to a force that drives it away from
its primary, but the attraction of the primary bends the path on which the satellite would have
proceeded if there had been no attraction between the bodies, and out of these forces a satellite
orbit is traced. The inertia or persistence of motion implanted in planets and satellites was
postulated by Newton, but he did not explain how or when the initial pull or push occurred.1
The theory of the origin of the planetary system which dominated the entire nineteenth century
was proposed by Swedenborg, the theologian, and Kant, the philosopher. It was put into
scientific terms by Laplace,2 although not explored by him quantitatively, and in brief is as
follows:
1 Isaac Newton, Principia (Mathematical Principles) (1686), Bk. III.
2 P. S. Laplace, Exposition du susteme du monde (1796).

WORLDS IN COLLISION
Hundreds of millions of years ago the sun was nebulous and very large and had a form
approaching that of a disc. This disc was as wide as the whole orbit of the farthest of the planets.
It rotated around its center. Owing to the process of compression caused by gravitation, a
globular sun shaped itself in the center of the disc. Because of the rotating motion of the whole
nebula, a centrifugal force was in action; parts of matter more on the periphery resisted the
retracting action directed toward the center and broke up into rings which balled into globes—
these were the planets in the process of shaping. In other words, as a result of the shrinkage of
the rotating sun, matter broke away and portions of this solar material developed into planets.
The plane in which the planets revolve is the equatorial plane of the sun.
This theory is now regarded as unsatisfactory. Three objections stand out above others. First, the
velocity of the axial rotation of the sun at the time the planetary system was built could not have
been sufficient to enable bands of matter to break away; but even if they had broken away, they
would not have balled into globes. Second, the Laplace theory does not explain why the planets
have larger angular velocity of daily rotation and yearly revolution than the sun could have
imparted to them. Third, what made some of the satellites revolve retrogradely, or in a direction
opposite to that of most of the members of the solar system?
"It appears to be clearly established that, whatever structure we assign to a primitive sun, a
planetary system cannot come into being merely as the result of the sun's rotation. If a sun,
rotating alone in space, is not able of itself to produce its family of planets and satellites, it
becomes necessary to invoke the presence and assistance of some second body. This brings us at
once to the tidal theory." 8

robin-bobin

The tidal theory, which, in its earlier stage, was called the plane-tesimal theory,4 assumes that a
star passed close to the sun. An immense tide of matter arose from the sun in the direction of the
passing star and was torn from the body of the sun but remained in its
3 Sir James H. Jeans, Astronomy and Cosmogony (1929), p. 409.
4 The planetesimal hypothesis was developed by T. C. Chamberlin and F. R. Moulton.
WORLDS 72V COLLISION
9
domain, being the material out of which the planets were built. In the planetesimal theory the
mass that was torn out broke into small parts which solidified in space; some were driven out of
the solar system, and some fell back into the sun, but the rest moved around it because of its
gravitational pull. Sweeping in elongated orbits around the sun, they conglomerated, rounded out
their orbits as a result of mutual collisions, and grew to form planets and satellites around the
planets.
The tidal theory 5 does not allow the matter torn from the sun to disperse first and reunite later;
the tide broke into a few portions that rather quickly changed from gaseous to fluid, and then to
the solid state. In support of this theory it was indicated that such a tide, when broken into a
number of "drops," would probably build the largest "drops" out of its middle portion, and small
"drops" from its beginning (near the sun) and its end (most remote from the sun). Actually,
Mercury, nearest to the sun, is a small planet. Venus is larger; earth is a little larger than Venus;
Jupiter is three hundred and twenty times as large as the earth (in mass); Saturn is somewhat
smaller than Jupiter; Uranus and Neptune, though large planets, are not as large as Jupiter and
Saturn. Pluto is quite as small as Mercury.
The first difficulty of the tidal hypothesis lies in the very point adduced in its support, the mass
of the planets. Between the earth and Jupiter there revolves a small planet, Mars, a tenth part of
the earth in mass, where, according to the scheme, a planet ten to fifty times as large as the earth
should be expected. Again, Neptune is larger and not smaller than Uranus.
Another difficulty is the allegedly rare chance of an encounter between two stars. One of the
authors of the tidal theory gave this estimate of its probability: 6
"At a rough estimate we may suppose that a given star's chance of forming a planetary system is
one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000 years." But since the life span of a star is much shorter than
this figure, "only about one star in 100,000 can have formed a planetary system in the whole of
its life." In the galactic system of one hundred million stars,
s The tidal theory was developed by J. H. Jeans and H. Jeffreys. 6 Jeans, Astronomy and
Cosmogony, p. 409.
10
WORLDS IN COLLISION
planetary systems "form at the rate of about one per five billion years. . . . our own system, with
an age of the order of two billion years, is probably the youngest system in the whole galactic
system of stars."
The nebular and tidal theories alike regard the planets as derivatives of the sun, and the satellites
as derivatives of the planets.
The problem of the origin of the moon can be regarded as disturbing to the tidal theory. Being
smaller than the earth, the moon completed earlier the process of cooling and shrinking, and the
lunar volcanoes had already ceased to be active. It is calculated that the moon possesses a lighter
specific weight than the earth. It is assumed that the moon was produced from the superficial
layers of the earth's body, which are rich in light silicon, whereas the core of the earth, the main
portion of its body, is made of heavy metals, particularly iron. But this assumption postulates the
origin of the moon as not simultaneous with the origin of the earth; the earth, being formed out
of a mass ejected from the sun, had to undergo a process of leveling, which placed the heavy
metals in the core and silicon at the periphery, before the moon parted from the earth by a new
tidal distortion. This would mean two consecutive tidal distortions in a system where the chance
of even one is held extremely rare. If the passing of one star near another happens among one
hundred million stars once in five billion years, two occurrences like this for one and the same
star seem quite incredible. Therefore, as no better explanation is available, the satellites are

robin-bobin

supposed to have been torn from the planets by the sun's attraction on their first perihelion
passage, when, sweeping along on stretched orbits, the planets came close to the sun.
The circling of the satellites around the planets also confronts existing cosmological theories
with difficulties. Laplace built his theory of the origin of the solar system on the assumption that
all planets and satellites revolve in the same direction. He wrote that the axial rotation of the sun
and the orbital revolutions and axial rotations of the six planets, the moon, the satellites, and the
rings of Saturn present forty-three movements, all in the same direction. "One finds by the
analysis of the probabilities that there are more than four thousand billion chances to one that
this arrangement is not the result of chance; this probability is considerably higher than that of
the reality
WORLDS IN COLLISION
11
of historical events with regard to which no one would venture a doubt." 7 He deduced that a
common and primal cause directed the movements of the planets and satellites.
Since the time of Laplace, new members of the solar system have been discovered. Now we
know that though the majority of the satellites revolve in the same direction as the planets
revolve and the sun rotates, the moons of Uranus revolve in a plane almost perpendicular to the
orbital plane of their planet, and three of the eleven moons of Jupiter, one of the nine moons of
Saturn, and the one moon of Neptune revolve retrogradely. These facts contradict the main
argument of the Laplace theory: a rotating nebula could not produce satellites revolving in two
directions.
In the tidal theory the direction of the planets' movements depended on the star that passed: it
passed in the plane in which the planets now revolve and in a direction which determined their
circling from west to east. But why should the satellites of Uranus revolve perpendicularly to
that plane and some moons of Jupiter and Saturn in reverse directions? This the tidal theory fails
to explain.
According to all existing theories, the angular velocity of the revolution of a satellite must be
slower than the velocity of rotation of its parent. But the inner satellite of Mars revolves more
rapidly than Mars rotates.
Some of the difficulties that confront the nebular and tidal theories also confront another theory
that has been proposed in recent years.8 According to it, the sun is supposed to have been a
member of a double star system. A passing star crushed the companion of the sun, and out of its
debris planets were formed. In further development of this hypothesis, it is maintained that the
larger planets were built out of the debris, and the smaller ones, the so-called "terrestrial" planets,
were formed from the larger ones by a process of cleavage.
The birth of smaller, solid planets out of the larger, gaseous ones is conjectured in order to
explain the difference in the relation of

du monde (1884), pp. 131-132.

WORLDS IN COLLISION
weight to volume in the larger and smaller planets; but this theory is unable to explain the
difference in the specific weights of the smaller planets and their satellites. By a process of
cleavage, the moon was born of the earth; but since the specific weight of the moon is greater
than that of the larger planets and smaller than that of the earth, it would seem to be more in
accord with the theory that the earth was born of the moon, despite its smallness. This confuses
the argument. The origin of the planets and their satellites remains unsolved. The theories not
only contradict one another, but each of them bears within itself its own contradictions. "If the
sun had been unattended by planets, its origin and evolution would have presented no difficulty."
•
The Origin of the Comets
The nebular and tidal theories endeavor to explain the origin of the solar system but do not
include the comets in their schemes. Comets are more numerous than planets. More than sixty

robin-bobin

comets are known to belong definitely to the solar system. These are the comets of short periods
(less than eighty years); they revolve in stretched ellipses and all but one do not go beyond the
line marked by the orbit of Neptune. It is estimated that, besides the comets of short periods,
several hundred thousand comets visit the solar system; however, it is not known for certain that
they return periodically. They are seen presently at an approximate rate of five hundred in a
century, and are said to have an average period of tens of thousands of years.
A few theories of the origin of comets have been proposed, but aside from one attempt to see in
them planetesimals that did not receive a side pull sufficiently strong to bring them into circular
orbits,1 no scheme has been developed that explains the origin of the solar system in its entirety,
with its planets and comets; yet no cosmic theory can persist which limits itself to the problem of
either planets or comets exclusively.

1 An attempt to explain the comets, in the frame of the planetesimal theory, as scattered debris of
a great wreck, was made by T. C. Chamberlin, The Two Solar Families (1928).

One theory sees in the comets errant cosmic bodies arriving from interstellar space. After
approaching the sun, they turn away on an open (parabolic) curve. But if they happen to pass
close to one of the larger planets, they may be compelled to change their open curves to ellipses
and become comets of short period.2 This is the theory of capture: comets of long periods or of
no period are dislodged from their paths to become short-period comets. What the origin of the
long-period comets is remains an unanswered question.
The short-period comets apparently have some relation to the larger planets. About fifty comets
move between the sun and the orbit of Jupiter; their periods are under nine years. Four comets
reach the orbit of Saturn; two comets revolve inside the circle described by Uranus; and nine
comets, with an average period of seventy-one years, move within the orbit of Neptune. These
comprise the system of the short-period comets as it is known at present. To the last group
belongs the Halley comet, which, among the comets of short periods, has the longest period of
revolution—about seventy-six years. Then there is a great gap, after which there are comets that
require thousands of years before they return to the sun, if they return at all.
The distribution of the short-period comets suggested the idea that they were "captured" by the
large planets. This theory has for its support the direct observation that comets are disturbed on
their path by the planets.
Another theory of the comets supposes their origin to have been in the sun, but in a manner
unlike that conceived of in the tidal theory of the origin of planets. Mighty whirls on the surface
of the sun sweep ignited gases into great protuberances; these are observed daily. Matter is
driven off from the sun and returns to the sun. It is calculated
2 That planets are able to change the path of a comet is not only known from observation but has
even been calculated in advance. In 1758 Clairaut predicted the retardation of Halley's comet, on
its first return foretold by Halley, for a period of 618 days, because it had to pass near Jupiter and
Saturn. It was retarded for almost the computed length of time. Similarly, the orbits of other
comets were occasionally distorted. LexelTs comet was disturbed by Jupiter in 1767 and in 1770
by the earth, D'Arest's comet was disturbed in 1860, Wolf's comet in 1875 and 1922. By an
encounter with Jupiter in 1886, Brook's comet changed its period from 29 years to 7 years; the
period of Jupiter was not altered by more than two or three minutes, and probably less.

that if the velocity of the ejection were to exceed 384 miles per second, the speed of motion in a
parabola, the matter would not return to the sun but would become a long-range comet. Then the
path of the ejected mass might become perturbed as a result of its passage near one of the larger
planets, and the comet would become one of a short period.
Birth of a comet in this manner has never been observed, and the probability that matter in
explosion may reach a speed of 384 miles per second is highly questionable. It was therefore

robin-bobin

supposed alternatively that millions of years ago, when the activity of their gaseous masses was
more dynamic, the large planets expelled comets from their bodies. The speed required for the
ejected mass to overcome the gravitational pull of the ejecting body is less in the case of the
planets than in the case of the sun, owing to their smaller gravitational pull. It is calculated that a
mass hurled from Jupiter at a speed of about 38 miles per second, or at only a little more than a
third of this velocity in the case of Neptune, would become expelled.
This variant of the theory neglects the question of the origin of the long-period comets. However,
an explanation was offered, according to which the large planets throw the comets that pass close
to them from their short orbits into elongated ones, or even expel them entirely from the solar
system.
When passing close to the sun, comets emit tails. It is assumed that the material of the tail does
not return to the comet's head but is dispersed in space; consequently, the comets as luminous
bodies must have a limited life. If Halley's comet has pursued its present orbit since late preCambrian times, it must "have grown and lost eight million tails, which seems improbable." 3 If
comets are wasted, their number in the solar system must permanently diminish, and no comet of
short period could have preserved its tail since geological times.
But as there are many luminous comets of short period, they must have been produced or
acquired at some time when other members of the system, the planets and the satellites, were
already in their places. A theory has been offered that once the solar system moved through a
nebula and obtained its comets there. 3H. N. Russell, The Solar System and Its Origin (1935), p.

Did the sun emit planets by shrinkage or by tide, and comets by explosion? Did the comets come
from interstellar space and were they captured into the solar system by larger planets? Did the
larger planets produce the smaller planets by cleavage, or did they expel the short-period comets
from their bodies?
It is admitted that we cannot know the truth about the origin of the planetary and cometary
systems billions of years ago. "The problem of the origin and development of the solar system
suffers from the label 'speculative.' It is frequently said that as we were not there when the
system was formed, we cannot legitimately arrive at any idea of how it was formed." * The most
we can do, it is believed, is to investigate one planet, the one under our feet, in order to learn its
past; and then, by the deductive method, to apply the results to other members of the solar
system.

CHAPTER 2
The Planet Earth
THE PLANET earth has a stony shell—the lithosphere; it consists of igneous rock, like granite
and basalt, with sedimentary rock on top. The igneous rock is the original crust of the earth;
sedimentary rock is deposited by water.
The inner composition of the earth is not known. The propagation of seismic waves gives
support to the assumption that the shell of the earth is over 2,000 miles thick; on the basis of the
gravitational effect of mountain masses (the theory of isostasy), the shell is estimated to be only
sixty miles thick.
The presence of iron in the shell or the migration of heavy metals from the core to the shell has
not been sufficiently explained. For these metals to have left the core, they must have been
ejected by explosions, and in order to remain spread through the crust, the explosions must have
been followed immediately by cooling.
If, in the beginning, the planet was a hot conglomerate of elements, as the nebular as well as the
tidal theories assume, then the iron of the globe should have become oxidized and combined
with all available oxygen. But for some unknown reason this did not take place; thus the
presence of oxygen in the terrestrial atmosphere is unexplained.

The water of the oceans contains a large amount of soluble sodium chloride, common salt.
Sodium might have come from rocks eroded by rain; but rocks are poor in chlorine and the
proportion of sodium and chlorine in sea water calls for fifty times more chlorine in the igneous
rock than it actually contains.

The deep strata of igneous rock contain no signs of fossil life. Incased in sedimentary rock are
skeletons of marine and land animals, often in many layers one upon the other. Not infrequently
igneous rock is found protruding into sedimentary rock or even covering it over large areas,
pointing to successive eruptions of igneous rock that became heated and molten after there was
life on the earth.
Upon strata which show no signs of fossil life are strata containing shells, and sometimes the
shells are so numerous as to constitute the entire mass of the rock. They are often found in the
hardest rock. Higher strata contain skeletons of land animals, often of extinct species, and not
infrequently, above the strata with the remains of land animals are other strata with marine fauna.
The species of the animals, and even their genera, change with the strata. The strata often assume
an oblique position, sometimes being almost vertical; frequently they are faulted and overturned
in many ways.
Cuvier (1769-1832), the founder of vertebrate paleontology, or the science of petrified skeletons
of animals possessing vertebrae, from fish to man, was much impressed by the picture presented
by the sequence of the layers of earth.
"When the traveller passes over these fertile plains where gently flowing streams nourish in their
course an abundant vegetation, and where the soil, inhabited by a numerous population, adorned
with flourishing villages, opulent cities, and superb monuments, is never disturbed, except by the
ravages of war, or by the oppression of the powerful, he is not led to suspect that Nature also has
had her intestine wars, and that the surface of the globe has been broken up by revolutions and
catastrophes. But his ideas change as soon as he digs into that soil which now presents so
peaceful an aspect." 1
Cuvier thought that great catastrophes had taken place on this earth, repeatedly changing sea
beds into continents and continents into sea beds. He held that genera and species were
unchangeable since Creation; but, observing different animal remains in various levels of earth,
he concluded that catastrophes must have annihilated

life in vast areas, leaving the ground for other forms of life. Where did these other genera come
from? Either they were newly created or, more likely they migrated from other parts of the
world, which were not at that time also visited by cataclysms.
He could not find the cause of these cataclysms. He saw in their traces "the problem in geology it
is of most importance to solve," but he realized that "in order to resolve it satisfactorily, it would
be necessary to discover the cause of these events—an undertaking which presents a difficulty of
quite a different kind." He knew only of "many fruitless attempts" already made and he did not
find himself able to offer a solution. "These ideas have haunted, I may almost say have
tormented me during my researches among fossil bones." 2
Cuvier's theory of stabilized forms of life and of annihilating catastrophes was supplanted by a
theory of evolution in geology (Lyell) and biology (Darwin). The mountains are what is left of
plateaus eroded by wind and water in a very slow process. Sedimentary rock is detritus of
igneous rock eroded by rain, then carried to sea, and there slowly deposited. Skeletons of birds
and of land animals in these rocks are presumed to have belonged to animals that waded close to
the shore of the sea in shallow water, died while wading, and were covered by sediment before
fish destroyed the cadavers or the water separated the bones of their skeletons. No widespread

robin-bobin

catastrophes disrupted the slow and steady process. The theory of evolution, which can be traced
to Aristotle, and which was the teaching of Lamarck in the days of Cuvier and of Darwin after
him, has been generally accepted as truth by natural sciences for almost a hundred years.
Sedimentary rock covers high mountains and the highest of all, the Himalayas. Shells and
skeletons of sea animals are found there. This means that at some early time fish swam over
these mountains. What caused the mountains to rise?
A force pushing from within or pulling from without or twisting on the sides must have elevated
the mountains and lifted continents from the bottom of the sea and submerged other land masses.
If we do not know what these forces are, we cannot answer the problem of the origin of the
mountains and of continents, wherever 3 Ibid., pp. 240-242.
20
WORLDS IN COLLISION
The process of raising the mountains is supposed to have been very slow and gradual. On the
other hand, it is clear that igneous rock, already hard, had to become fluid in order to penetrate
sedimentary rock or cover it. It is not known what initiated this process, but it is asserted that it
must have happened long before man appeared on the earth. So when skulls of early man are
found in late deposits, or skulls of modern man are found together with bones of extinct animals
in early deposits, difficult problems are presented. Occasionally, also, during mining operations,
a human skull is found in the middle of a mountain, under a thick cover of basalt or granite, like
the Calaveras skull of California.
Human remains and human artifacts of bone, polished stone, or pottery are found under great
deposits of till and gravel, sometimes under as much as a hundred feet.
The origin of clay, sand, and gravel on igneous and sedimentary rock, offers a problem. The
theory of Ice Ages was put forth (1840) to explain this and other enigmatic phenomena. As far
north as Spitzbergen, in the polar circle, at some time in the past, coral reefs were formed, which
do not occur except in tropical regions; palms also grew on Spitzbergen. The continent of
Antarctica, which today has not a single tree on it, must have been covered at one time by
forests, since it has coal deposits.
As we see, the planet earth is full of secrets. We have not come closer to solving the problem of
the origin of the solar system by investigating the planet under our feet; on the contrary, we have
found many other unsolved problems concerning the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere
of the earth. Shall we be more fortunate if we try to understand the process that caused the
changes on the globe in the most recent geological epoch, the time of the last glacial period, a
period close to the time which is regarded as historical?

on the globe we are faced with it. Here is how the question is put concerning the eastern coast of
North America.
"Not long ago in a geological sense, the flat plain from New Jersey to Florida was under the sea.
At that time the ocean surf broke directly on the Old Appalachian Mountains. Previously the
southeastern part of the mountain structure had sunk below the sea and become covered with a
layer of sand and mud, thickening seaward. The wedgelike mass of marine sediments was then
uplifted and cut into by rivers, giving the Atlantic coastal plain of the United States. Why was it
uplifted? To the westward are the Appalachians. The geologist tells us of the stressful times
when a belt of rocks extending from Alabama to Newfoundland was jammed, thrust together, to
make this mountain system. Why? How was it done? In former times the sea flooded the region
of the great plains from Mexico to Alaska, and then withdrew. Why this change?" 3
The birth of the Cordilleras—"again the mystery of mountain-making clamors for solution."
And so on all over the world. The Himalayas were under the sea. Now Eurasia is three miles or
more above the bottom of the Pacific. Why?

robin-bobin

"The problem of mountain-making is a vexing one: many of them [mountains] are composed of
tangentially compressed and over-thrust rocks that indicate scores of miles of circumferential
shortening in the Earth's crust. Radial shrinkage is woefully inadequate to cause the observed
amount of horizontal compression. Therein lies the real perplexity of the problem of mountainmaking. Geologists have not yet found a satisfactory escape from this dilemma." *
Even authors of textbooks confess their ignorance. "Why have sea floors of remote periods
become the lofty highlands of today? What generates the enormous forces that bend, break, and
mash the rocks in mountain zones? These questions still await satisfactory answers."5

ice lay not only on the slopes of high mountains, but loaded itself in heavy masses upon
continents even in moderate latitudes. Where today the Hudson, the Elbe, and the upper Dnieper
flow, there were then frozen deserts. They were like the immense glacier of Greenland that
covers that island. There are signs that a retreat of the glaciers was interrupted by a new massing
of ice, and that their borders differed at various times. Geologists are able to find the boundaries
of the glaciers. Ice moves very slowly, pushing stones before it, and accumulations of stones or
moraines remain when the glacier retreats melting away.
Traces have been found of five or six consecutive displacements of the ice sheet during the Ice
Age, or of five or six glacial periods. Some force repeatedly pushed the ice sheet toward
moderate latitudes. Neither the cause of the ice ages nor the cause of the retreat of the icy desert
is known; the time of these retreats is also a matter of speculation.
Many ideas were offered and guesses made to explain how the glacial epochs originated and why
they terminated. Some supposed that the sun at different times emits more or less heat, which
causes periods of heat and cold on the earth; but no evidence that the sun is such a "variable star"
was adduced to support this hypothesis.
Others conjectured that cosmic space has warmer and cooler areas, and that when our solar
system travels through the cooler areas, ice descends upon latitudes closer to the tropics. But no
physical agents were found responsible for such hypothetical cold and warm areas in space.
A few wondered whether the precession of the equinoxes or the slow change in the direction of
the terrestrial axis might cause periodic variations in the climate. But it was shown that the
difference in insolation could not have been great enough to have been responsible for the glacial
ages.
Still others thought to find the answer in the periodic variations in the eccentricity of the ecliptic
(terrestrial orbit), with glaciation at the maximal eccentricity. Some of them supposed that winter
in aphelion, the remotest part of the ecliptic, would cause glaciation; and some thought that
summer in aphelion would produce that effect.

Some scholars thought about the changes in the position of the terrestrial axis. If the planet earth
is rigid, as it is regarded to be (L. Kelvin), the axis could not have shifted in geological times by
more than three degrees (George Darwin); if it were elastic, it could have shifted up to ten or
fifteen degrees in a very slow process.
The cause of the ice ages was seen by a few scholars in the decrease of the original heat of the
planet; the warm periods between the ice ages were attributed to the heat set free by a
hypothetical decomposition of organisms in the strata close to the surface of the ground. The
increase and decrease in the action of warm springs were also considered.
Others supposed that dust of volcanic origin filled the terrestrial atmosphere and hindered
insolation, or, contrariwise, that an increased content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
obstructed the reflection of heat rays from the surface of the planet. A decrease in the amount of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause a fall of temperature (Arrhenius), but calculations
were made to show that this could not be the real cause of the glacial ages (Angstrom).

robin-bobin

Changes in the direction of warm currents in the Atlantic Ocean were brought into the
discussion, and the Isthmus of Panama was theoretically removed to allow the Gulf Stream to
pass into the Pacific at the time of the glacial periods. But it was proved that the two oceans were
already divided in the Ice Age; besides, a part of the Gulf Stream would have remained in the
Atlantic anyway. The periodic retreats of ice between the glacial periods would have required
periodic removal and replacement of the Isthmus of Panama.
Other theories of equally hypothetical nature were proposed; but the phenomena held responsible
for the changes have not been proved to have existed, or to have been able to produce the effect.
All the above-mentioned theories and hypotheses fail if they cannot meet a most important
condition: In order for ice masses to have been formed, increased precipitation must have taken
place. This requires an increased amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which is the result of
increased evaporation from the surface of
WORLDS IN COLLISION
23
oceans; but this could be caused by heat only. A number of scientists pointed out this fact, and
even calculated that in order to produce a sheet of ice as large as that of the Ice Age, the surface
of all the oceans must have evaporated to a depth of many feet. Such an evaporation of oceans
followed by a quick process of freezing, even in moderate latitudes, would have produced the ice
ages. The problem is: What could have caused the evaporation and immediately subsequent
freezing? As the cause of such quick alternation of heating and freezing of large parts of the
globe is not apparent, it is conceded that "at present the cause of excessive ice-making on the
lands remains a baffling mystery, a major question for the future reader of earth's riddles." 1
Not only are the causes of the appearance and later disappearance of the glacial sheet unknown,
but the geographical shape of the area covered by ice is also a problem. Why did the glacial
sheet, in the southern hemisphere, move from the tropical regions of Africa toward the south
polar region and not in the opposite direction, and, similarly, why, in the northern hemisphere,
did the ice move in India from the equator toward the Himalaya mountains and the higher
latitudes? Why did the glaciers of the Ice Age cover the greater part of North America and
Europe, while the north of Asia remained free? In America the plateau of ice stretched up to
latitude 40° and even passed across this line; in Europe it reached latitude 50°; while
northeastern Siberia, above the polar circle, even above latitude 75°, was not covered with this
perennial ice. All hypotheses regarding increased and diminished insolation due to solar
alterations or the changing temperature of the cosmic space, and other similar hypotheses, cannot
avoid being confronted with this problem.
Glaciers are formed in the regions of eternal snow; for this reason they remain on the slopes of
the high mountains. The north of Siberia is the coldest place in the world. Why did not the Ice
Age touch this region, whereas it visited the basin of the Mississippi and all Africa south of the
equator? No satisfactory solution to this question has been proposed.

The Mammoths
Northeast Siberia, which was not covered by ice in the Ice Age, conceals another enigma. The
climate there has apparently changed drastically since the end of the Ice Age, and the yearly
temperature has dropped manv degrees below its previous level. Animals once lived in this
region that do not live there now, and plants grew there that are unable to grow there now. The
change must have occurred quite suddenly. The cause of this Klimasturz has not been explained.
In this catastrophic change of climate and under mysterious circumstances, all the mammoths of
Siberia perished.
The mammoth belonged to the family of elephants. Its tusks were sometimes as much as ten feet
long. Its teeth were highly developed and their "density" was greater than in any other stage in
the evolution of the elephants; apparently they did not succumb in the struggle for survival as an

robin-bobin

unfit product of evolution. The extinction of the mammoth is thought to have coincided with the
end of the last glacial period.
Tusks of mammoths have been found in large numbers in northeast Siberia; this well-preserved
ivorv has been an object of export to China and Europe ever since the Russian conquest of
Siberia and was exploited in even earlier times. In modern times the ivory market of the world
still found its main source of supply in the tundras of northeast Siberia.
In 1799 the frozen bodies of mammoths were found in these tundras. The corpses were well
preserved, and the sledge dogs ate the flesh unharmed. "The flesh is fibrous and marbled with
fat" and 'looks as fresh as well frozen beef." 1
What was the cause of their death and the extinction of their race?
Cuvier wrote of the extinction of the mammoths: "Repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea
have neither all been slow nor gradual; on the contrary, most of the catastrophes which have
occasioned them have been sudden; and this is especially easy to be proved with regard to the
last of these catastrophes, that which, by a twofold

25
motion, has inundated, and afterwards laid dry, our present continents, or at least a part of the
land which forms them at the present day. In the northern regions it has left the carcasses of large
quadrupeds which became enveloped in the ice, and have thus been preserved even to our own
times, with their skin, their hair, and their flesh. If they had not been frozen as soon as killed,
they would have been decomposed by putrefaction. And, on the other hand, this eternal frost
could not previously have occupied the places in which they have been seized by it, for they
could not have lived in such a temperature. It was, therefore, at one and the same moment that
these animals were destroyed and the country which they inhabited became covered with ice.
This event has been sudden, instantaneous, without any gradation, and what is so clearly
demonstrated with respect to this last catastrophe, is not less so with reference to those which
have preceded it." 2
The theory of repeated catastrophes annihilating life on this planet and repeated creations or
restorations of life, offered by Deluc 3 and expanded by Cuvier, did not convince the scientific
world. Like Lamarck before Cuvier, Darwin after him thought that an exceedingly slow
evolutional process governs genetics, and that there were no catastrophes interrupting this
process of infinitesimal changes. According to the theory of evolution, these minute changes
came as a result of adaptation to living conditions in the struggle of the species for survival.
Like the theories of Lamarck and Darwin, which postulate slow changes in animals, with tens of
thousands of years required for a minute step in evolution, the geological theories of the
nineteenth century, and of the twentieth as well, regard the geological processes as exceedingly
slow and dependent on erosion by rain, wind, and tides.
Darwin admitted that he was unable to find an explanation for the extermination of the
mammoth, an animal better developed than

the elephant which survived.* But in conformity with the theory of evolution, his followers
supposed that a gradual sinking of the land forced the mammoths to the hills, where they found
themselves isolated by marshes. However, if geological processes are slow, the mammoths
would not have been trapped on the isolated hills. Besides, this theory cannot be true because the
animals did not die of starvation. In their stomachs and between their teeth undigested grass and
leaves were found. This, too, proves that they died from a sudden cause. Further investigations
showed that the leaves and twigs found in their stomachs do not now grow in the regions where
the animals died, but far to the south, a thousand or more miles away. It is apparent that the

robin-bobin

climate has changed radically since the death of the mammoths; and as the bodies of the animals
were found not decomposed but well preserved in blocks of ice, the change in temperature must
have followed their death very closely or even caused it.
There remains to be added that after storms in the Arctic, tusks of mammoths are washed up on
the shores of arctic islands; this proves that a part of the land where the mammoths lived and
were drowned is covered by the Arctic Ocean.
The Ice Age and the Antiquity of Man
The mammoth lived in the age of man. Man pictured it on the walls of caves; remains of men
have repeatedly been found in Central Europe together with remains of mammoths; occasionally
the settlements of the neolithic man of Europe are found strewn with the bones of mammoths.1
Man moved southward when Europe was covered with ice and returned when the ice retreated.
Historical man witnessed great variation in climate. The mammoth of Siberia, the meat of which
is still fresh, is supposed to have been destroyed at

the end of the last glacial period, simultaneously with the mammoths of Europe and Alaska. If
this is so, the Siberian mammoth was also the contemporary of a rather modern man. At a time
when in Europe, close to the ice sheet, man was still in the later stages of neolithic culture, in the
Near and Middle East—the region of the great cultures of antiquity—he may already have
progressed well into the metal age. There exists no chronological table of neolithic culture
because the art of writing was invented approximately at the advent of the copper—the early—
period of the Bronze Age. It is presumed that the neolithic man of Europe left pictures but no
inscriptions, and consequently there are no means of determining the end of the Ice Age in terms
of chronology.
Geologists have tried to find the time of the end of the last glacial period by measuring the
detritus carried by rivers from the glaciers and the deposits of detritus in lakes. The quantity
carried by the Rhone from the glaciers of the Alps and the amount on the bottom of the Lake of
Geneva, through which the Rhone flows, were calculated, and from the figures obtained the time
and velocity of the retreat of the glacial sheet of the last glacial period were estimated. According
to the Swiss scholar Francois Forel, twelve thousand years have passed since the time the ice
sheet of the last glacial period began to melt, an unexpectedly low figure, as it was thought that
the ice age ended thirty to fifty thousand years ago.
Such calculations suffer from being only indirect evaluations; and since the velocity at which the
glacial mud had been deposited in the lakes was not constant and the amount varied, the mud
must have assembled on the bottom of a lake at a faster rate in the beginning when the glaciers
were larger; and if the Ice Age terminated suddenly,'the deposition of detritus would have been
much heavier at first, and there would be little analogy to the accumulation of detritus from the
seasonal melting of snow in the Alps. Therefore, the time that has elapsed since the end of the
last glacial period must have been even shorter than reckoned.
Geologists regard the Great Lakes of America as having been formed at the end of the Ice Age
when the continental glacier retreated and the depressions freed from the glacier became lakes.

the last two hundred years Niagara Falls has retreated from Lake Ontario toward Lake Erie at the
rate of five feet annually, washing lown the rocks of the bed of the falls.2 If this process has been
going m at the same rate since the end of the last glacial period, about seven thousand years were
needed to move Niagara Falls from the mouth of the gorge at Queenston to its present position.
The assumption that the quantity of water moving through the gorge has been uniform since the

robin-bobin

end of the Ice Age is the basis of this calculation, and therefore, it was concluded, seven
thousand years may constitute "the maximum length of time since the birth of the falls." 3 In the
beginning, when immense masses of water were released by the retreat of the continental glacier,
the rate of movement of Niagara Falls must have been much more rapid; the time estimate "may
need significant reduction," and is sometimes lowered to five thousand years.4 The erosion and
sedimentation on the shores and the bottom of Lake Michigan also suggest a lapse of time
counted in thousands, but not in tens of thousands, of years. Also the result of paleontological
research in America carries evidence which constitutes "a guarantee that before the last period of
glaciation, modern man, in the form of that highly developed race, the American Indian, was
living on the eastern seaboard of North America" (A. Keith).5 It is assumed that with the advent
of the last glacial period the Indians retreated southward, returning to the north when the ice
uncovered the ground and when the Great Lakes emerged, the basin of the St. Lawrence was
formed, and Niagara Falls began its retreat toward Lake Erie.
If the end of the last glacial period occurred only a few thousand years ago, in historical times or

have been already employed in the centers of ancient civilization, the records written in rocks by
nature and the records written by man must give a coordinated picture. Let us, therefore,
investigate the traditions and the literary records of ancient man, and compare them with the
records of nature.
The World Ages
A conception of ages that were brought to their end by violent changes in nature is common all
over the world. The number of ages differs from people to people and from tradition to tradition.
The difference depends on the number of catastrophes that the particular people retained in its
memory, or on the way it reckoned the end of an age.
In the annals of ancient Etruria, according to Varro, were records of seven elapsed ages.
Censorinus, an author of the third Christian century and compiler of Varro, wrote that "men
thought that different prodigies appeared by means of which the gods notified mortals at the end
of each age. The Etruscans were versed in the science of the stars, and after having observed the
prodigies with attention, they recorded these observations in their books."*
The Greeks had similar traditions. "There is a period," wrote Censorinus, "called 'the supreme
year' by Aristotle, at the end of which the sun, moon, and all the planets return to their original
position. This 'supreme year' has a great winter, called by the Greeks kata-klysmos, which means
deluge, and a great summer, called by the Greeks ekpyrosis, or combustion of the world. The
world, actually, seems to be inundated and burned alternately in each of these epochs."
Anaximenes and Anaximander in the sixth pre-Christian century, and Diogenes of Apollonia in
the fifth century, assumed the destruction of the world with subsequent recreation. Heraclitus (540 to -475) taught that the world is destroyed in conflagration after every period of 10,800
years. Aristarchus of Samos in the third century be1 Censorinus Liber de die natali xviii.

fore the present era taught that in a period of 2,484 years the earth undergoes two destructions—
of combustion and deluge. The Stoics generally believed in periodic conflagrations by which the
world was consumed, to be shaped anew. "This is due to the forces of ever-active fire which
exists in things and in the course of long cycles of time resolves everything into itself and out of
it is constructed a reborn world" —so Philo presented the notion of the Stoics that our world is
refashioned in periodic conflagrations.2 In one such catastrophe the world will meet its ultimate
destruction; colliding with another world, it will fall apart into atoms out of which, in a long
process, a new earth will be created somewhere in the universe. "Democritus and Epicurus,"
explained Philo, "postulate many worlds, the origin of which they ascribe to the mutual impacts
and interlacing of atoms, and their destruction to the counterblows and collisions by the bodies
so formed." As this earth goes to its ultimate destruction, it passes through recurring cosmic
catastrophes and is re-formed with all that lives on it.
Hesiod, one of the earliest Greek authors, wrote about four ages and four generations of men that
were destroyed by the wrath of the planetary gods. The third age was the age of bronze; when it
was destroyed by Zeus, a new generation repeopled the earth, and using bronze for arms and
tools, they began to use iron, too. The heroes of the Trojan War were of this fourth generation.
Then a new destruction was decreed, and after that came "yet another generation, the fifth, of
men who are upon the bounteous earth"—the generation of iron.3 In another work of his, Hesiod
described the end of one of the ages. "The life-giving earth crashed around in burning ... all the
land seethed, and the Ocean's streams ... it seemed even as if Earth and wide Heaven above came
together; for such a mighty crash would have arisen if Earth were being hurled to ruin, and
Heaven from on high were hurling her down." 4
Analogous traditions of four expired ages persist on the shores of

the Bengal Sea and in the highland of Tibet—the present age is the fifth.5
The sacred Hindu book Bhagavata Purana tells of four ages and of pralayas or cataclysms in
which, in various epochs, mankind was nearly destroyed; the fifth age is that of the present. The
world ages are called Kalpas or Yugas. Each world age met its destruction in catastrophes of
conflagration, flood, and hurricane. Ezour Vedam and Bhaga Vedam, sacred Hindu books,
keeping to the scheme of four expired ages, differ only in the number of years ascribed to each.6
In the chapter, "World Cycles," in Visuddhi-Magga, it is said that "there are three destructions:
the destruction by water, the destruction by fire, the destruction by wind," but that there are
seven ages, each of which is separated from the previous one by a world catastrophe.7
Reference to ages and catastrophes is found in Avesta (Zend-Avesta), the sacred scriptures of
Mazdaism, the ancient religion of the Persians.8 "Bahman Yast," one of the books of Avesta,
counts seven world ages or millennia.9 Zarathustra (Zoroaster), the prophet of Mazdaism, speaks
of "the signs, wonders, and perplexity which are manifested in the world at the end of each
millennium."10
The Chinese call the perished ages kis and number ten kis from the beginning of the world until
Confucius.11 In the ancient Chinese encyclopedia, Sing-li-ta-tsiuen-chou, the general

ture are discussed. Because of the periodicity of these convulsions, the span of time between two
catastrophes is regarded as a "great year." As during a year, so during a world age, the cosmic
mechanism winds itself up and "in a general convulsion of nature, the sea is carried out of its
bed, mountains spring out of the ground, rivers change their course, human beings and
everything are ruined, and the ancient traces effaced." 12
An old tradition, and a very persistent one, of world ages that went down in cosmic catastrophes
was found in the Americas among the Incas,13 the Aztecs, and the Mayas.14 A major part of
stone inscriptions found in Yucatan refer to world catastrophes. "The most ancient of these
fragments [katuns or calendar stones of Yucatan] refer, in general, to great catastrophes which, at
intervals and repeatedly, convulsed the American continent, and of which all nations of this
continent have preserved a more or less distinct memory."15 Codices of Mexico and Indian
authors who composed the annals of their past give a prominent place to the tradition of world
catastrophes that decimated humankind and changed the face of the earth.
In the chronicles of the Mexican kingdom it is said: "The ancients knew that before the present
sky and earth were formed, man was already created and life had manifested itself four times."
16
A tradition of successive creations and catastrophes is found in the Pacific—on Hawaii17 and on
the islands of Polynesia: there were nine ages and in each age a different sky was above the
earth.18 Icelanders, too, believed that nine worlds went down in a succession of ages, a tradition
that is contained in the Edda.19

The rabbinical conception of ages crystallized in the post-Exilic period. Already before the birth
of our earth, worlds had been shaped and brought into existence, only to be destroyed in time.
"He made several worlds before ours, but He destroyed them all." This earth, too, was not
created at the beginning to satisfy the Divine Plan. It underwent reshaping, six consecutive
remoldings. New conditions were created after each of the catastrophes. On the fourth earth lived
the generation of the Tower of Babel; we belong to the seventh age. Each of the ages or "earths"
has a name.
Seven heavens were created and seven earths were created: the most removed, the seventh,
Eretz; the sixth, Adamah; the fifth, Arka; the fourth, Harabah; the third, Yabbashah; the second,
Tevel; and "our own land called Heled, and like the others, it is separated from the foregoing by
abyss, chaos, and water."20 Great catastrophes changed the face of the earth. "Some perished by
deluge, others were consumed by conflagration," wrote the Jewish philosopher Philo.21
According to the rabbinical authority Rashi, ancient tradition knows of periodic collapses of the
firmament, one of which occurred in the days of the Deluge, and which repeated themselves at

robin-bobin

intervals of 1,656 years.22 The duration of the world ages varies in Armenian and Arabian
traditions.23
The Sun Ages
An oft-repeated occurrence in the traditions of the world ages is the advent of a new sun in the
sky at the beginning of every age. The word "sun" is substituted for the word "age" in the
cosmogonical traditions of many peoples all over the world.
The Mayas counted their ages by the names of their consecutive suns. These were called Water
Sun, Earthquake Sun, Hurricane Sun, Fire Sun. "These suns mark the epochs to which are
attributed the various catastrophes the world has suffered."1
Ixtlilxochitl (circa 1568-1648), the native Indian scholar, in his

annals of the kings of Tezcuco, described the world ages by the names of "suns." 2 The Water
Sun (or Sun of Waters) was the first age, terminated by a deluge in which almost all creatures
perished; the Earthquake Sun or age perished in a terrific earthquake when the earth broke in
many places and mountains fell. The world age of the Hurricane Sun came to its destruction in a
cosmic hurricane. The Fire Sun was the world age that went down in a rain of fire.3
"The nations of Culhua or Mexico," Humboldt quoted G6mara, the Spanish writer of the
sixteenth century, "believe according to their hieroglyphic paintings, that, previous to the sun
which now enlightens them, four had already been successively extinguished. These four suns
are as many ages, in which our species has been annihilated by inundations, by earthquakes, by a
general conflagration, and by the effect of destroying tempests." * Every one of the four
elements participated in each of the catastrophes; deluge, hurricane, earthquake, and fire gave
their names to the catastrophes because of the predominance of one of them in the upheavals.
Symbols of the successive suns are painted on the pre-Columbian literary documents of
Mexico.5
"Cinco soles que son edades," or "five suns that are epochs," wrote G6mara in his description of
the conquest of Mexico.8 An analogy to this sentence of Gomara may be found in Lucius
Ampelius, a Roman author, who, in his book Liber memorialis, wrote: 7 "Soles fuere quinque"
(There were five suns): It is the same belief that Gomara found in the New World.
The Mexican Annals of Cuauhtitlan, written in Nahua-Indian (circa 1570) and based on ancient
sources, contains the tradition of seven sun epochs. Chicon-Tonatiuh or "the Seven Suns" is the
designation for the world cycles or acts in the cosmic drama.8

on "World Cycles."9 "There are three destructions: the destruction by water, the destruction by
fire, the destruction by wind." After the catastrophe of the deluge, "when now a long period has
elapsed from the cessation of the rains, a second sun appeared." In the interim the world was
enveloped in gloom. "When this second sun appears, there is no distinction of day and night,"
but "an incessant heat beats upon the world." When the fifth sun appeared, the ocean gradually
dried up; when the sixth sun appeared, "the whole world became filled with smoke." "After the

robin-bobin

lapse of another long period, a seventh sun appears, and the whole world breaks into flames."
This Buddhist book refers also to a more ancient "Discourse on the Seven Suns."10
The Brahmans called the epochs between two destructions "the great days."11
The Sibylline books recite the ages in which the world underwent destruction and regeneration.
"The Sibyl told as follows: 'The nine suns are nine ages. . . . Now is the seventh sun.'" The Sibyl
prophesied two ages yet to come—that of the eighth and of the ninth sun.12
The aborigines of British North Borneo, even today, declare that the sky was originally low, and
that six suns perished, and at present the world is illuminated by the seventh sun.13
Seven solar ages are referred to in Mayan manuscripts, in Buddhist sacred books, in the books of
the Sibyl. In all quoted sources the "suns" are explained (by the sources themselves) as
signifying consecutive epochs, each of which went down in a great, general destruction.
Did the reason for the substitution of the word "sun" for "epoch" by the peoples of both
hemispheres lie in the changed appearance of the luminary and in its changed path across the sky
in each world age?

No book, or collection of books, in the history of mankind has had a more attentive reading, a
wider circulation, or more diligent investigation than the Old Testament. —R. H. Pfeiffer,
Introduction to the Old Testament
CHAPTER 1
The Most Incredible Story
T'HE MOST incredible story of miracles is told about Joshua ben Nun who, when pursuing the
Canaanite kings at Beth-horon, implored the sun and the moon to stand still. "And he said in the
sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And
the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their
enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven,
and hasted not to go down about a whole day" (Joshua 10:12-13).
This story is beyond the belief of even the most imaginative or the most pious person. Waves of
stormy sea may have drowned one host and been merciful to another. The earth could crack
asunder and swallow up human beings. The Jordan could be blocked by a slice of its bank falling
into the bed of the river. Jericho's walls—not by the blast of trumpets, but by an incidental
earthquake—could have been breached.
But that the sun and the moon should halt in their movement across the firmament—this could
be only the product of fancy, a poetic image, a metaphor;1 a hideous implausibility when
imposed as a subject for belief;2 a matter for scorn—it manifests even a want of reverence for
the Supreme Being.

heights of one heroic and lyrical composition." G. Schiaparelli, Astronomy in the Old Testament

WORLDS IN COLLISION
According to the knowledge of our age—not of the age when the Book of Joshua or of Jasher
was written—this could have happened if the earth had ceased for a time to roll along its

robin-bobin

prescribed path. Is such a disturbance conceivable? No record of the slightest confusion is
registered in the present annals of the earth. Each year consists of 365 days, 5 hours, and 49
minutes.
A departure of the earth from its regular rotation is thinkable, but only in the very improbable
event that our planet should meet another heavenly body of sufficient mass to disrupt the eternal
path of our world.
It is true that aerolites or meteorites reach our earth continually, sometimes by the thousands and
tens of thousands. But no dislocation of our precise turning round and round has ever been
perceived.
This does not mean that a larger body, or a larger number of bodies, could not strike the
terrestrial sphere. The large number of asteroids between the orbits of the planets Mars and
Jupiter suggests that at some unknown time another planet revolved there; now only these
meteorites follow approximately the path along which the destroyed planet circled the sun.
Possibly a comet ran into it and shattered it.
That a comet may strike our planet is not very probable, but the idea is not absurd. The heavenly
mechanism works with almost absolute precision; but unstable, their way lost, comets by the
thousands, by the millions, revolve in the sky, and their interference may disturb the harmony.
Some of these comets belong to our system. Periodically they return, but not at very exact
intervals, owing to the perturbations caused by gravitation toward the larger planets when they
fly too close to them. But innumerable other comets, often seen only through the telescope, come
flying in from immeasurable spaces of the universe at very great speed, and disappear—possibly
forever. Some comets are visible only for hours, some for days or weeks or even months.
concerning the wonder of the sun standing still: "The Scripture did not intend to teach men
philosophy, or accommodate itself to the true and Pythagoric system of the world." And again:
"The prophets and holy penmen themselves . . . being seldom or never philosophers, were not
capable of representing these things otherwise than they, with the vulgar, understood them."
WORLDS IN COLLISION
41
Might it happen that our earth, the earth under our feet, would roll toward perilous collision with
a huge mass of meteorites, a trail of stones flying at enormous speed around and across our solar
system? This probability was analyzed with fervor during the last century. From the time of
Aristotle, who asserted that a meteorite, which fell at Aegospotami when a comet was glowing in
the sky, had been lifted from the ground by the wind and carried in the air and dropped over that
place, until the year 1803 when, on April 26, a shower of meteorites fell at 1'Aigle in France and
was investigated by Biot for the French Academy of Sciences, the scholarly world—and in the
meantime there lived Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Kepler, Newton, and Huygens—did not
believe that such a thing as a stone falling from the sky was possible at all. And this despite
many occasions when stones fell before the eyes of a crowd, as did the aerolite in the presence of
Emperor Maximilian and his court in Ensisheim, Alsace, on November 7, 1492.3
Only shortly before 1803, the Academy of Sciences of Paris refused to believe that, on another
occasion, stones had fallen from the sky. The fall of meteorites on July 24, 1790 in southwest
France was pronounced "un phenomene physiquement impossible." 4 Since the year 1803,
however, scholars have believed that stones fall from the sky. If a stone can collide with the
earth, and occasionally a shower of stones, too, cannot a full-sized comet fly into the face of the
earth? It was calculated that such a possibility exists but that it is very unlikely to occur.5
If the head of a comet should pass very close to our path, so as to effect a distortion in the career
of the earth, another phenomenon besides the disturbed movement of the planet would probably
occur:
3 C. P. Olivier, Meteors (1925), p. 4.
4 P. Bertholon, Vubhlicazionl della specola astronomica Vaticana (1913).
5 D. F. Arago computed on some occasion that there is one chance in 280 million that a comet
will hit the earth. Nevertheless, a hole one mile in diameter in Arizona is a sign of an actual
headlong collision of the earth with a small comet or asteroid. On June 30, 1908, a calculated

robin-bobin

forty-Uiousand-ton mass of iron fell in Siberia at 60° 56' north latitude and 101° 57' east
longitude. In 1946 the small Giacobini-Zinner comet passed within 131,000 miles of the point
where the earth was eight days later.
While investigating whether an encounter between the earth and a comet had
42
WORLDS IN COLLISION
a rain of meteorites would strike the earth and would increase to a torrent. Stones scorched by
flying through the atmosphere would be hurled on home and head.
In the Book of Joshua, two verses before the passage about the sun that was suspended on high
for a number of hours without moving to the Occident, we find this passage:
>"As they [the Canaanite kings] fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron ... the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died:
they were more which died with hail stones [stones of barad] than they whom the children of
Israel slew with the sword." 6
The author of the Book of Joshua was surely ignorant of any connection between the two
phenomena. He could not be expected to have had any knowledge about the nature of aerolites,
about the forces of attraction between celestial bodies, and the like. As these phenomena were
recorded to have occurred together, it is improbable that the records were invented.
The meteorites fell on the earth in a torrent. They must have fallen in very great numbers for they
struck down more warriors than the swords of the adversaries. To have killed persons by the
hundreds or thousands in the field, a cataract of stones must have fallen. Such
been the subject of a previous discussion, I found that W. Whiston, Newton's successor at
Cambridge and a contemporary of Halley, in his New Theory of the Earth (the first edition of
which appeared in 1696) tried to prove that the comet of 1680, to which he (erroneously)
ascribed a period of 575K years, caused the biblical Deluge on an early encounter.
G. Cuvier, who was unable to offer his own explanation of the causes of great cataclysms, refers
to the theory of Whiston in the following terms: "Whiston fancied that the earth was created
from the atmosphere of one comet, and that it was deluged by the tail of another. The heat which
remained from its first origin, in his opinion, excited the whole antediluvian population, men and
animals, to sin, for which they were all drowned in the deluge, excepting the fish, whose
passions were apparently less violent."
I. Donnelly, author, reformer, and member of the United States House of Representatives, tried
in his book Ragnarok (1883) to explain the presence of till and gravel on the rock substratum in
America and Europe by hypothesizing an encounter with a comet, which rained till on the
terrestrial hemisphere facing it at that moment. He placed the event in an indefinite period, but at
a time when man already populated the earth. Donnelly did not show any awareness that
Whiston was his predecessor. His assumption that there is till only in one half of the earth is
arbitrary and wrong. 6 Joshua 10: 11.
WORLDS IN COLLISION
43
a torrent of great stones would mean that a train of meteorites or a comet had struck our planet.
The quotation in the Bible from the Book of Jasher is laconic and may give the impression that
the phenomenon of the motionless sun and moon was local, seen only in Palestine between the
valley of Ajalon and Gibeon. But the cosmic character of the prodigy is pictured in a
thanksgiving prayer ascribed to Joshua:
Sun and moon stood still in heaven,
and Thou didst stand in Thy wrath against our oppressors. . . .
All the princes of the earth stood up,
the kings of the nations had gathered themselves together. . . .
Thou didst destroy them in Thy fury, and Thou didst ruin them in Thy rage.
Nations raged from fear of Thee,
kingdoms tottered because of Thy wrath. . . .
Thou didst pour out Thy fury upon them. . . . Thou didst terrify them in Thy wrath. . . .
The earth quaked and trembled from the noise of Thy thunders.

robin-bobin

Thou didst pursue them in Thy storm,
Thou didst consume them in the whirlwind. . . .
Their carcasses were like rubbish.7
The wide radius over which the heavenly wrath swept is emphasized in the prayer: "All the
kingdoms tottered. . . ."
A torrent of large stones coming from the sky, an earthquake, a whirlwind, a disturbance in the
movement of the earth—these four phenomena belong together. It appears that a large comet
must have passed very near to our planet and disrupted its movement; a part of the stones
dispersed in the neck and tail of the comet smote the surface of our earth a shattering blow.
Are we entitled, on the basis of the Book of Joshua, to assume that at some date in the middle of
the second millennium before the present era the earth was interrupted in its regular rotation by a
comet? Such a statement has so many implications that it should not
1 Ginzberg, Legends, IV, 11-12.
44
WORLDS IN COLLISION
be made thoughtlessly. To this I say that though the implications are great and many, the present
research in its entirety is an interlinked sequence of documents and other evidence, all of which
in common carry the weight of this and other statements in this book.
The problem before us is one of mechanics. Points on the outer layers of the rotating globe
(especially near the equator) move at a higher linear velocity than points on the inner layers, but
at the same angular velocity. Consequently, if the earth were suddenly stopped (or slowed down)
in its rotation, the inner layers might come to rest (or their rotational velocity might be slowed)
while the outer layers would still tend to go on rotating. This would cause friction between the
various liquid or semifluid layers, creating heat; on the outermost periphery the solid layers
would be torn apart, causing mountains and even continents to fall or rise.
As I shall show later, mountains fell and others rose from level ground; the earth with its oceans
and continents became heated; the sea boiled in many places, and rock liquefied; volcanoes
ignited and forests burned. Would not a sudden stop by the earth, rotating at a little over one
thousand miles an hour at its equator, mean a complete destruction of the world? Since the world
survived, there must have been a mechanism to cushion the slowing down of terrestrial rotation,
if it really occurred, or another escape for the energy of motion besides transformation into heat,
or both. Or if rotation persisted undisturbed, the terrestrial axis may have tilted in the presence of
a strong magnetic field, so that the sun appeared to lose for hours its diurnal movement.8 These
problems are kept in sight and are faced in the Epilogue of this volume.
On the Other Side of the Ocean
> The Book of Joshua, compiled from the more ancient Book of Jasher, relates the order of
events. "Joshua . . . went up from Gilgal all night." In the early morning he fell upon his enemies
unawares at Gibeon, and "chased them along the way that goes up to Beth8 This explanation was suggested to me by M. Abramovich of Tel Aviv.

45
horon." As they fled, great stones were cast from the sky. That same day ("in the day when the
Lord delivered up the Amorites") the sun stood still over Gibeon and the moon over the valley of
Ajalon. It has been noted that this description of the position of the luminaries implies that the
sun was in the forenoon position.1 The Book of Joshua says that the luminaries stood in the
midst of the sky.
Allowing for the difference in longitude, it must have been early morning or night in the Western
Hemisphere.
We go to the shelf where stand books with the historical traditions of the aborigines of Central
America.
The sailors of Columbus and Cortes, arriving in America, found there literate peoples who had

Paris, the Vatican, the Prado, and Dresden; they are called codici, and their texts have been
studied and partly read. However, among the Indians of the days of the conquest and also of the
following century there were literary men who had access to the knowledge written in
pictographic script by their forefathers.2
In the Mexican Annals of Cuauhtitlan 3—the history of the empire of Culhuacan and Mexico,
written in Nahua-Indian in the sixteenth century—it is related that during a cosmic catastrophe
that occurred in the remote past, the night did not end for a long time.
The biblical narrative describes the sun as remaining in the sky for an additional day ("about a
whole day"). The Midrashim, the books of ancient traditions not embodied in the Scriptures,
relate that the sun and the moon stood still for thirty-six itim, or eighteen hours,*

and thus from sunrise to sunset the day lasted about thirty hours.
In the Mexican annals it is stated that the world was deprived of light and the sun did not appear
for a fourfold night. In a prolonged day or night time could not be measured by the usual means
at the disposal of the ancients.5
Sahagun, the Spanish savant who came to America a generation
fter Columbus and gathered the traditions of the aborigines, wrote
that at the time of one cosmic catastrophe the sun rose only a little
way over the horizon and remained there witiiout moving; the moon
also stood still.8
I am dealing with the Western Hemisphere first, because the biblical stories were not known to
its aborigines when it was discovered. Also, the tradition preserved by Sahagun bears no trace of
having been introduced by the missionaries: in his version there is nothing to suggest Joshua ben
Nun and his war against the Canaanite kings; and the position of the sun, only a very little above
the eastern horizon, differs from the biblical text, though it does not contradict it.
We could follow a path around the earth and inquire into the various traditions concerning the
prolonged night and prolonged day, with sun and moon absent or tarrying at different points
along the zodiac, while the earth underwent a bombardment of stones in a world ablaze. But we
must postpone this journey. There was more than one catastrophe when, according to the
memory of mankind, the earth refused to play the chronometer by undisturbed rotation on its
axis. First, we must differentiate the single occurrences of cosmic catastrophes, some of which
took place before the one described here, some after it; some of which were of greater extent,
and some of lesser.

CHAPTER 2
Fifty-two Years Earlier

robin-bobin

THE PRE-COLUMBIAN written traditions of Central America tell us that fifty-two years before
the catastrophe that closely resembles that of the time of Joshua, another catastrophe of world
dimensions had occurred.1 It is therefore only natural to go back to the old Israelite traditions, as
narrated in the Scriptures, to determine whether they contain evidence of a corresponding
catastrophe. i»The time of the Wandering in the Desert is given by the Scriptures as forty years.
Then, for a number of years before the day of the disturbed movement of the earth, the protracted
conquest of Palestine went on.2 It seems reasonable, therefore, to ask whether a date fifty-two
years before this event would coincide with the time of the Exodus.
In the work Ages in Chaos, I describe at some length the catastrophe that visited Egypt and
Arabia. In that work it is explained that the Exodus took place amid a great natural upheaval that
terminated the period of Egyptian history known as the Middle Kingdom. There I endeavor to
show that contemporary Egyptian documents describe the same disaster accompanied by "the
plagues of Egypt," and that the traditions of the Arabian Peninsula relate similar occurrences in
this land and on the shores of the Red Sea. In that work I refer also to Beke's idea that Mt. Sinai
was a smoking volcano. However, I reveal that "the scope of the catastrophe must

have exceeded by far the measure of the disturbance which could be caused by one active
volcano," and I promise to answer the question: "Of what nature and dimension was this
catastrophe, or this series of catastrophes, accompanied by plagues?" and to publish an
investigation into the nature of great catastrophes of the past. Both works—the reconstruction of
history and the reconstruction of natural history—were conceived within the short interval of
half a year; the desire to establish a correct historical chronology before fitting the acts of nature
into the periods of human history impelled me to complete Ages in Chaos first.3
I shall employ some of the historical material from the first chapters of Ages in Chaos. There I
use it for the purpose of synchronizing events in the histories of the countries around the eastern
Mediterranean; here I shall use it to show that the same events took place all around the world,
and to explain the nature of these events.
The Red World
^ In the middle of the second millennium before the present era, as I intend to show, the earth
underwent one of the greatest catastrophes in its history. A celestial body that only shortly before
had become a member of the solar system—a new comet—came very close to the earth. The
account of this catastrophe can be reconstructed from evidence supplied by a large number of
documents.
The comet was on its way from its perihelion and touched the earth first with its gaseous tail.
Later in this book I shall show that it was about this comet that Servius wrote: "Non igneo sed
sanguineo rubore fuisse" (It was not of a flaming but of a bloody redness).
One of the first visible signs of this encounter was the reddening of the earth's surface by a fine
dust of rusty pigment. In sea, lake, and river this pigment gave a bloody coloring to the water.
Because of these particles of ferruginous or other soluble pigment, the world turned red.
The Manuscript QuichS of the Mayas tells that in the Western Hemisphere, in the days of a great
cataclysm, when the earth quaked

49
and the sun's motion was interrupted, the water in the rivers turned to blood.1
Aipuwer, the Egyptian eyewitness of the catastrophe, wrote his lament on papyrus: 2 "The river
is blood," and this corresponds with the Book of Exodus (7 :20): "All the waters that were in the
river were turned to blood." The author of the papyrus also wrote: 'Tlague is throughout the land.
Blood is everywhere," and this, too, corresponds with the Book of Exodus (7 : 21): "There was
blood throughout all the land of Egypt."

robin-bobin

vThe presence of the hematoid pigment in the rivers caused the death of fish followed by
decomposition and smell. "And the river stank" (Exodus 7:21). "And all the Egyptians digged
round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river"
(Exodus 7:24). The papyrus relates: "Men shrink from tasting; human beings thirst after water,"
and "That is our water! That is our happiness! What shall we do in respect thereof? All is ruin."
. The skin of men and of animals was irritated by the dust, which caused boils, sickness, and the
death of cattle— "a very grievous murrain." 3 Wild animals, frightened by the portents in the
sky, came close to the villages and cities.4
The summit of mountainous Thrace received the name "Haemus," and Apollodorus related the
tradition of the Thracians that the summit was so named because of the "stream of blood which
gushed out on the mountain" when the heavenly battle was fought between Zeus and Typhon,
and Typhon was struck by a thunderbolt.5 It is said that a city in Egypt received the same name
for the same reason.6

contemporaneous with the end of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt and the Exodus. It must have
been composed shortly following the catastrophe.

The mythology which personified the forces of the cosmic drama described the world as colored
red. In one Egyptian myth the bloody hue of the world is ascribed to the blood of Osiris, the
mortally wounded planet god; in another myth it is the blood of Seth or Apopi; in the Babylonian
myth the world was colored red by the blood of the slain Tiamat, the heavenly monster.7
The Finnish epos of Kalevala describes how, in the days of the cosmic upheaval, the world was
sprinkled with red milk.8 The Altai Tatars tell of a catastrophe when "blood turns the whole
world red," and a world conflagration follows.9 The Orphic hymns refer to the time when the
heavenly vault, "mighty Olympus, trembled fearfully . . . and the earth around shrieked fearfully,
and the sea was stirred [heaped], troubled with its purple waves." 10
v An old subject for debate is: Why is the Red Sea so named? If a sea is called Black or White,
that may be due to the dark coloring of the water or to the brightness of the ice and snow. The
Red Sea has a deep blue color. As no better reason was found, a few coral formations or some
red birds on its shores were proposed as explanations of its name.11
Like all the water in Egypt, the water on the surface of the Sea of the Passage was of a red tint. It
appears that Raphael was not mistaken when, in painting the scene of the passage, he colored the
water red.
It was, of course, not this mountain or that river or that sea exclusively that was reddened, thus
earning the name Red or Bloody, as distinguished from other mountains and seas. But crowds of
men, wherever they were, who witnessed the cosmic upheaval and escaped with their lives,
ascribed the name Haemus or Red to particular places.

The phenomenon of "blood" raining from the sky has also been observed in limited areas and on
a small scale in more recent times. One of these occasions, according to Pliny, was during the
consulship of Manius Acilius and Gaius Porcius.12 Babylonians, too, recorded red dust and rain
falling from the sky;13 instances of "bloody rain" have been recorded in divers countries.14 The
red dust, soluble in water, falling from the sky in water drops, does not originate in clouds, but
must come from volcanic eruptions or from cosmic spaces. The fall of meteorite dust is a
phenomenon generally known to take place mainly after the passage of meteorites; this dust is
found on the snow of mountains and in polar regions.15
The Hail of Stones
Following the red dust, a "small dust," like "ashes of the furnace," fell "in all the land of Egypt"
(Exodus 9:8), and then a shower of meteorites flew toward the earth. Our planet entered deeper
into the tail of the comet. The dust was a forerunner of the gravel. There fell "a very grievous
hail, such as has not been in Egypt since its foundations" (Exodus 9 : 18). Stones of "barad," here
translated "hail," is, as in most places where mentioned in the Scriptures, the term for meteorites.
We are also informed by Midrashic and Tal-mudic sources that the stones which fell on Egypt
were hot;J this fits only meteorites, not a hail of ice.2 In the Scriptures it is said that

these stones fell "mingled with fire" (Exodus 9 :24), the meaning of which I shall discuss in the
following section, and that their fall was accompanied by "loud noises" (kolot), rendered as
"thunder-ings," a translation which is only figurative, and not literally correct, because the word
for "thunder" is raam, which is not used here. The fall of meteorites is accompanied by crashes
or explosion-like noises, and in this case they were so "mighty," that, according to the Scriptural
narrative, the people in the palace were terrified as much by the din of the falling stones as by the
destruction they caused (Exodus 9:28).
^>The red dust had frightened the people, and a warning to keep men and cattle under shelter
had been issued: "Gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and
beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hailstones shall come
down upon them, and they shall die" (Exodus 9 : 19). "And he that regarded not the word of the
Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field" (Exodus 9 : 21). >Similarly, the Egyptian
eyewitness: "Cattle are left to stray, and there is none to gather them together. Each man fetches
for himself those that are branded with his name." 3 Falling stones and fire made the frightened
cattle flee.
--»Ipuwer also wrote: "Trees are destroyed," "No fruits, no herbs are found," "Grain has perished
on every side," "That has perished which yesterday was seen. The land is left to its weariness
like the cutting of flax." 4 In one day fields were turned to wasteland. In the Book of Exodus (9 :
25) it is written: "And the hail [stones of barad] smote every herb of the field, and brake every
tree of the field."
The description of such a catastrophe is found in the Visuddhi-Magga, a Buddhist text on the
world cycles. "When a world cycle is destroyed by wind . . . there arises in the beginning a cycledestroying great cloud. . . . There arises a wind to destroy the world cycle, and first it raises a

... as mighty trees on the hill tops." The wind "turns the ground upside down," large areas "crack
and are thrown upwards," "all the mansions on earth" are destroyed in a catastrophe when
"worlds clash with worlds." 5
The Mexican Annals of Cuauhtitlan describe how a cosmic catastrophe was accompanied by a
hail of stones; in the oral tradition of the Indians, too, the motif is repeated time and again: In
some ancient epoch the sky "rained, not water, but fire and red-hot stones," 8 which is not
different from the Hebrew tradition.
Naphtha
Crude petroleum is composed of two elements, carbon and hydrogen. The main theories of the
origin of petroleum are:
1. The inorganic theory: Hydrogen and carbon were brought together in the rock formations of
the earth under great heat and pressure.
2. The organic theory: Both the hydrogen and carbon which compose petroleum come from the
remains of plant and animal life, in the main from microscopic marine and swamp life.
The organic theory implies that the process started after life was already abundant, at least at the
bottom of the ocean.1
The tails of comets are composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen gases. Lacking oxygen, they
do not burn in flight, but the inflammable gases, passing through an atmosphere containing
oxygen, will be set on fire. If carbon and hydrogen gases, or vapor of a composition of these two
elements, enter the atmosphere in huge masses, a part of them will burn, binding all the oxygen
available at the moment; the

1 Even before Plutarch the problem of the origin of petroleum was much discussed. Speaking of
the visit of Alexander to the petroleum sources of Iraq, Plutarch said: 'There has been much
discussion about the origin of [this naphtha]." But in the extant text of Plutarch a sentence
containing one of two rival views is missing. The remaining text reads: ". . . or whether rather the
liquid substance that feeds the flame flows out from the soil which is rich and productive of fire."

rest will escape combustion, but in swift transition will become liquid. Falling on the ground, the
substance, if liquid, would sink into the pores of the sand and into clefts between the rocks;
falling on water, it would remain floating if the fire in the air is extinguished before new supplies
of oxygen arrive from other regions.
The descent of a sticky fluid which came earthward and blazed with heavy smoke is recalled in
the oral and written traditions of the inhabitants of both hemispheres.
Popol-Vuh, the sacred book of the Mayas, narrates: 2 "It was ruin and destruction . . . the sea was
piled up ... it was a great inundation . . . people were drowned in a sticky substance raining from
the sky. . . . The face of the earth grew dark and the gloomy rain endured days and nights. . . .
And then there was a great din of fire above their heads." The entire population of the land was
annihilated.
The Manuscript Quiche perpetuated the picture of the population of Mexico perishing in a
downpour of bitumen: 3 "There descended from the sky a rain of bitumen and of a sticky
substance. . . . The earth was obscured and it rained day and night. And men ran hither and
thither and were as if seized by madness; they tried to climb to the roofs, and the houses crashed

down; they tried to climb the trees, and the trees cast them far away; and when they tried to
escape in caves and caverns, these were suddenly closed."
A similar account is preserved in the Annals of Cuauhtitlan.* The age which ended in the rain of
fire was called Quiauh-tonatiuh, which means "the sun of fire-rain." 5
And far away, in the other hemisphere, in Siberia, the Voguls carried down through the centuries
and millennia this memory: "God sent a sea of fire upon the earth. . . . The cause of the fire they
call 'the fire-water.'" 6

tribes relate that in the remote past Sengle-Das or "water of fire" rained from the sky; with very
few exceptions, all men died.7 NThe eighth plague as described in the Book of Exodus was
"harad [meteorites] and fire mingled with the barad, very grievous, such as there was none like it
in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation" (Exodus 9 : 24). There were "thunder [correct:
loud noises] and barad, and the fire ran along upon the ground" (Exodus 9 : 23).
The Papyrus Ipuwer describes this consuming fire: "Gates, columns, and walls are consumed by
fire. The sky is in confusion."8 The papyrus says that this fire almost "exterminated mankind."
The Midrashim, in a number of texts, state that naphtha, together with hot stones, poured down
upon Egypt. "The Egyptians refused to let the Israelites go, and He poured out naphtha over
them, burning blains [blisters]." It was "a stream of hot naphtha." 9 Naphtha is petroleum in
Aramaic and Hebrew.
The population of Egypt was "pursued with strange rains and hails and showers inexorable, and
utterly consumed with fire: for what was most marvelous of all, in the water which quencheth all
things the fire wrought yet more mightily," 10 which is the nature of burning petroleum; in the
register of the plagues in Psalms 105 it is referred to as "flaming fire," and in Daniel (7 :10) as
"river of fire" or "fiery stream."
- In the Passover Haggadah it is said that "mighty men of Pul and Lud [Lydia in Asia Minor]
were destroyed with consuming conflagration on the Passover."

have deposits of oil: Mexico, the East Indies, Siberia, Iraq, and
Egypt.
For a span of time after the combustive fluid poured down, it may well have floated upon the
surface of the seas, soaked the surface of the ground, and caught fire again and again. "For seven
winters and summers the fire has raged ... it has burnt up the earth," narrate the Voguls of
Siberia.12

The story of the wandering in the desert contains a number of references to fire springing out of
the earth. The Israelites traveled three days' journey away from the Mountain of the Lawgiving,
and it happened that "the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the
uttermost parts of the camp" (Numbers 11:1). The Israelites continued on their way. Then came
the revolt of Korah and his confederates. "And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them
up. . . . And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them. . . . And there came out
a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense." 13
When they kindled the fire of incense, the vapors which rose out of the cleft in the rock caught
the flame and exploded.
Unaccustomed to handling this oil, rich in volatile derivatives, the Israelite priests fell victims to
the fire. The two elder sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, "died before the Lord, when they
offered strange fire before the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai."14 The fire was called strange
because it had not been known before and because it was of foreign origin.
If oil fell on the desert of Arabia and on the land of Egypt and burned there, vestiges of
conflagration must be found in some of the tombs built before the end of the Middle Kingdom,
into which the oil or some of its derivatives might have seeped.
We read in the description of the tomb of Antefoker, vizier of Sesostris I, a pharaoh of the
Middle Kingdom: "A problem is set us

by a conflagration, clearly deliberate, which has raged in the tomb, as in many another. . . . The
combustible material must not only have been abundant, but of a light nature; for a fierce fire
which speedily spent itself seems alone able to account for the fact that tombs so burnt remain
absolutely free from blackening, except in the lowest parts; nor are charred remains found as a
rule. The conditions are puzzling."15
"And what does natural history tell us?" asked Philo in his On the Eternity of the World,16 and
answered: "Destructions of things on earth, destructions not of all at once but of a very large
number, are attributed by it to two principal causes, the tremendous onslaughts of fire and water.
These two visitations, we are told, descend in turns after very long cycles of years. When the
agent is the conflagration, a stream of heaven-sent fire pours out from above and spreads over
many places and overruns great regions of the inhabited earth."
The rain of fire-water contributed to the earth's supply of petroleum; rock oil in the ground
appears to be, partly at least, "star oil" brought down at the close of world ages, notably the age
that came to its end in the middle of the second millennium before the present era.
The priests of Iran worshiped the fire that came out of the ground. The followers of
Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism are also called fire worshipers. The fire of the Caucasus was held in
great esteem by all the inhabitants of the adjacent lands. Connected with the Caucasus and
originating there is the legend of Prometheus.17 He was chained to a rock for bringing fire to
man. The allegorical character of this legend gains meaning when we consider Augustine's
words that Prometheus was a contemporary of Moses.18
Torrents of petroleum poured down upon the Caucasus and were consumed. The smoke of the
Caucasus fire was still in the imaginative

The continuing fires in Siberia, the Caucasus, in the Arabian desert, and everywhere else were
blazes that followed the great conflagration of the days when the earth was caught in vapors of
carbon and hydrogen.
In the centuries that followed, petroleum was worshiped, burned in holy places; it was also used
for domestic purposes. Then many ages passed when it was out of use. Only in the middle of the
last century did man begin to exploit this oil, partly contributed by the comet of the time of the
Exodus. He utilized its gifts, and today his highways are crowded with vehicles propelled by oil.
Into the heights rose man, and he accomplished the age-old dream of flying like a bird; for this,
too, he uses the remnants of the intruding star that poured fire and sticky vapor upon his
ancestors.
The Darkness
The earth entered deeper into the tail of the onrushing comet and approached its body. This
approach, if one is to believe the sources, was followed by a disturbance in the rotation of the
earth. Terrific hurricanes swept the earth because of the change or reversal of the angular
velocity of rotation and because of the sweeping gases, dust, and cinders of the comet.
Numerous rabbinical sources describe the calamity of darkness; the material is collated as
follows: x
An exceedingly strong wind endured seven days. All the time the land was shrouded in darkness.
"On the fourth, fifth, and sixth days, the darkness was so dense that they [the people of Egypt]
could not stir from their place." "The darkness was of such a nature that it could not be dispelled
by artificial means. The light of the fire was either extinguished by the violence of storm, or else
it was made invisible and swallowed up in the density of the darkness. . . . Nothing could be
discerned. . . . None was able to speak or to hear, nor could anyone venture to take food, but they
lay themselves down 1 Ginzberg, Legends, II, 360.

59
, . . their outward senses in a trance. Thus they remained, overwhelmed by the affliction."
The darkness was of such kind that "their eyes were blinded by it and their breath choked"; 2 it
was "not of ordinary earthy kind." 3 The rabbinical tradition, contradicting the spirit of the
Scriptural narrative, states that during the plague of darkness the vast majority of the Israelites
perished and that only a small fraction of the original Israelite population of Egypt was spared to
leave Egypt. Forty-nine out of every fifty Israelites are said to have perished in this plague.4 wA

inscription in hieroglyphics. It reads: "The land was in great affliction. Evil fell on this earth. . . .
There was a great upheaval in the residence. . . . Nobody could leave the palace [there was no
exit from the palace] during nine days, and during these nine days of upheaval there was such a
tempest that neither men nor gods [the royal family] could see the faces of those beside them." 5
This record employs the same description of the darkness as Exodus 10 : 22: "And there was a
thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days. They saw not one another, neither rose any
from his place for three days."
The difference in the number of the days (three and nine) of the darkness is reduced in the
rabbinical sources, where the time is given as seven days. The difference between seven and nine
days is negligible if one considers the subjectivity of the time estimation under such conditions.
Appraisal of the darkness with respect to its impenetrability is also subjective; rabbinical sources
say that for part of the time there was a very slight visibility, but for the rest (three days) there
was no visibility at all.

It should be kept in mind that, as in the case I have already discussed, a day and a night of
darkness or light can be described as one day or as two days.
^ That both sources, the Hebrew and the Egyptian, refer to the same event can be established by
another means also. Following the prolonged darkness and the hurricane, the pharaoh, according
to the hieroglyphic text of the shrine, pursued the "evil-doers" to "the place called Pi-Khiroti."
The same place is mentioned in Exodus 14:9: "But the Egyptian pursued after them, all the
horses and chariots of Pharaoh . . . and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hakhiroth." •
*VThe inscription on the shrine also narrates the death of the pharaoh during this pursuit under
exceptional circumstances: "Now when the Majesty fought with the evil-doers in this pool, the
place of the whirlpool, the evil-doers prevailed not over his Majesty. His Majesty leapt into the
place of the whirlpool." This is the same apotheosis described in Exodus 15 :19: "For the horse
of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought
again the waters of the sea upon them." *-If "the Egyptian darkness" was caused by the earth's
stasis or tilting of its axis, and was aggravated by a thin cinder dust from the comet, then the
entire globe must have suffered from the effect of these two concurring phenomena; in either the
eastern or the western parts of the world there must have been a very extended, gloomy day.
Nations and tribes in many places of the globe, to the south, to the north, and to the west of
Egypt, have old traditions about a cosmic catastrophe during which the sun did not shine; but in
some parts of the world the traditions maintain that the sun did not set for a period of time equal
to a few days.
Tribes of the Sudan to the south of Egypt refer in their tales to a time when the night would not
come to an end.7
Kalevala, the epos of the Finns, tells of a time when hailstones of

"Khiroth." 7 L. Frobenius, Dichten und Denken im Sudan (1925), p. 38.

iron fell from the sky, and the sun and the moon disappeared (were stolen from the sky) and did
not appear again; in their stead, after a period of darkness, a new sun and a new moon were
placed in the sky.8 Caius Julius Solinus writes that "following the deluge which is reported to
have occurred in the days of Ogyges, a heavy night spread over the globe." 9
In the manuscripts of Avila and Molina, who collected the traditions of the Indians of the New
World, it is related that the sun did not appear for five days; a cosmic collision of stars preceded
the cataclysm; people and animals tried to escape to mountain caves. "Scarcely had they reached
there when the sea, breaking out of bounds following a terrifying shock, began to rise on the
Pacific coast. But as the sea rose, filling the valleys and the plains around, the mountain of
Ancasmarca rose, too, like a ship on the waves. During the five days that this cataclysm lasted,
the sun did not show its face and the earth remained in darkness." 10
Thus the traditions of the Peruvians describe a time when the sun did not appear for five days. In
the upheaval, the earth changed its profile, and the sea fell upon the land.11
East of Egypt, in Babylonia, the eleventh tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh [Gilgamish] refers to
the same events. From out the horizon rose a dark cloud and it rushed against the earth; the land
was shriveled by the heat of the flames. "Desolation . . . stretched to heaven; all that was bright
was turned into darkness. . . . Nor could a brother distinguish his brother. . . . Six days . . . the
hurricane, deluge, and tempest continued sweeping the land . . . and all human back to its clay
was returned." 12

fold night concluded a world age,13 and the book Bundahis, in a context that I shall quote later
and that shows a close relation to the events of the cataclysm I describe here, tells of the world
being dark at midday as though it were in deepest night: it was caused, according to the
Bundahis, by a war between the stars and the planets.14
A protracted night, deepened by the onrushing dust sweeping in from interplanetary space,
enveloped Europe, Africa, and America, the valleys of the Euphrates and the Indus also. If the
earth did not stop rotating but slowed down or was tilted, there must have been a longitude
where a prolonged day was followed by a prolonged night. Iran is so situated that, if one is to
believe the Iranian tradition, the sun was absent for a threefold day, and then it shone for a
threefold day. Farther to the east there must have been a protracted day corresponding to the
protracted night in the west.
According to "Bahman Yast," at the end of a world age in eastern Iran or in India the sun
remained ten days visible in the sky.
In China, during the reign of the Emperor Yahou, a great catastrophe brought a world age to a
close. For ten days the sun did not set.15 The events of the time of the Emperor Yahou deserve
close examination; I shall return to the subject shortly.16
Earthquake
-- The earth, forced out of its regular motion, reacted to the close approach of the body of the
comet: a major shock convulsed the lithosphere, and the area of the earthquake was the entire
globe. -. Ipuwer witnessed and survived this earthquake. "The towns are destroyed. Upper
Egypt has become waste. . . . All is ruin." "The

i6 The way the Egyptians estimated the time the sun was not in the sky must have been similar to
the Chinese method of estimation. It is very probable that these peoples reckoned the disturbance
as lasting five days and five nights (because a ninefold or tenfold period elapsed from one
sunrise or sunset to the other).

residence is overturned in a minute."1 Only an earthquake could have overturned the residence in
a minute. The Egyptian word for "to overturn" is used in the sense of "to overthrow a wall." 2
This was the tenth plague. "And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the
Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one
dead" (Exodus 12:30). Houses fell, smitten by one violent blow. "[The angel of the Lord] passed
over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered
our houses" (Exodus 12:27). Nogaf, meaning "smote," is the word used for a very violent blow,
as, for instance, goring by the horns of an ox. The Passover Haggadah says: "The firstborn of the
Egyptians didst Thou crush at midnight."
. The reason why the Israelites were more fortunate in this plague than the Egyptians probably
lies in the kind of material of which their dwellings were constructed. Occupying a marshy
district and working on clay, the captives must have lived in huts made of clay and reeds, which
are more resilient than brick or stone. "The Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the
destroyer to come and smite your houses." 3 An example of the selective action of a natural
agent upon various kinds of construction is narrated also in Mexican annals. During a
catastrophe accompanied by hurricane and earthquake, only the people who lived in small log
cabins remained uninjured; the larger buildings were swept away. "They found that those who
lived in small houses had escaped, as well as the newly-married couples, whose custom it was to
live for a few years in cabins in front of those of their fathers-in-law."4

In Ages in Chaos (my reconstruction of ancient history), I shall show that "first-born" (bkhor) in
the text of the plague is a corruption of "chosen" (bchor). All the flower of Egypt succumbed in
the catastrophe.

-VTorsooth: The children of princes are dashed against the walls . . . the children of princes are
cast out in the streets"; "the prison is ruined," wrote Ipuwer,5 and this reminds us of princes in
palaces and captives in dungeons who were victims in the disaster (Exodus 12:29).
To confirm my interpretation of the tenth plague as an earthquake, which should be obvious
from the expression, "to smite the houses," I find a corroborating passage of Artapanus in which
he describes the last night before the Exodus, and which is quoted by Eusebius: There was "hail
and earthquake by night, so that those who fled from the earthquake were killed by the hail, and
those who sought shelter from the hail were destroyed by the earthquake. And at that time all the
houses fell in, and most of the temples." 6
Also, Hieronymus (St. Jerome) wrote in an epistle that "in the night in which Exodus took place,
all the temples of Egypt were destroyed either by an earthshock or by the thunderbolt." 7
Similarly in the Midrashim: "The seventh plague, the plague of barad [meteorites] : earthquake,
fire, meteorites." 8 It is also said that the structures which were erected by the Israelite slaves in
Pithom and Ramses collapsed or were swallowed by the earth.9 An inscription which dates from
the beginning of the New Kingdom refers to a temple of the Middle Kingdom that was
"swallowed by the ground" at the close of the Middle Kingdom.10
The head of the celestial body approached very close, breaking through the darkness of the
gaseous envelope, and according to the Midrashim, the last night in Egypt was as bright as the
noon on the day of the summer solstice.11

/XThe population fled. "Men flee. . . . Tents are what they make like the dwellers of hills," wrote
Ipuwer.12 The population of a city destroyed by an earthquake usually spends the nights in the
fields. The Book of Exodus describes a hurried flight from Egypt on the night of the tenth
plague; a "mixed multitude" of non-Israelites left Egypt together with the Israelites, who spent
their first night in Sukkoth (huts).13
^"The lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. . . . Thou leddest thy people
like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron." 14 They were brought out of Egypt by a portent
which looked like a stretched arm—"by a stretched out arm and by great terrors," or "with a
mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with
wonders." 15

"At midnight" all the houses of Egypt were smitten; "there was not a house where there was not
one dead." This happened on the night of the fourteenth of the month Aviv (Exodus 12:6; 13:4).

robin-bobin

This is the night of Passover. It appears that the Israelites originally celebrated Passover on the
eve of the fourteenth of Aviv.
The month Aviv is called "the first month" (Exodus 12:18). Thout was the name of the first
month of the Egyptians. What, for the Israelites, became a feast, became a day of sadness and
fasting for the Egyptians. "The thirteenth day of the month Thout [is] a very bad day. Thou shalt
not do anything on this day. It is the day of the combat which Horus waged with Seth."1
The Hebrews counted (and still count) the beginning of the day from sunset; 2 the Egyptians
reckoned from sunrise.3 As the catastrophe took place at midnight, for the Israelites it was the
fourteenth day of the (first) month; for the Egyptians it was the thirteenth day.

An earthquake caused by contact or collision with a comet must be felt simultaneously all around
the world. An earthquake is a phenomenon that occurs from time to time; but an earthquake
accompanying an impact in the cosmos would stand out and be recalled as a memorable date by
survivors.
In the calendar of the Western Hemisphere, on the thirteenth day of the month, called olin,
"motion" or "earthquake," 4 a new sun is said to have initiated another world age.5 The Aztecs,
like the Egyptians, reckoned the day from sunrise.6
Here we have, en passant, the answer to the open question concerning the origin of the
superstition which regards the number 13, and especially the thirteenth day, as unlucky and
inauspicious. It is still the belief of many superstitious persons, unchanged through thousands of
years and even expressed in the same terms: "The thirteenth day is a very bad day. You shall not
do anything on this day."
I do not think that any record of this belief can be found dating from before the time of the
Exodus. The Israelites did not share this superstition of the evil-working number thirteen (or
fourteen).

CHAPTER 3
The Hurricane
THE SWIFT shifting of the atmosphere under the impact of the gaseous parts of the comet, the
drift of air attracted by the body of the comet, and the rush of the atmosphere resulting from
inertia when the earth stopped rotating or shifted its poles, all contributed to produce hurricanes
of enormous velocity and force and of worldwide dimensions.
Manuscript Troano and other documents of the Mayas describe a cosmic catastrophe during
which the ocean fell on the continent, and a terrible hurricane swept the earth 1 The hurricane
broke up and carried away all towns and all forests.2 Exploding volcanoes, tides sweeping over
mountains, and impetuous winds threatened to annihilate humankind, and actually did annihilate
many species of animals. The face of the earth changed, mountains collapsed, other mountains
grew and rose over the onrushing cataract of water driven from oceanic spaces, numberless
rivers lost their beds, and a wild tornado moved through the debris descending from the sky. The
end of the world age was caused by Hurakan, the physical agent that brought darkness and swept
away houses and trees and even rocks and mounds of earth. From this name is derived
"hurricane," the word we use for a strong wind. Hurakan destroyed the major part of the human
race. In the darkness swept by wind, resinous stuff fell

from the sky and participated with fire and water in the destruction of the world.3 For five days,
save for the burning naphtha and burning volcanoes, the world was dark, since the sun did not
appear.
The theme of a cosmic hurricane is reiterated time and again in the Hindu Vedasand in the
Persian Avesta* and diluvium venti, the deluge of wind, is a term known from many ancient
authors.5 In the Section, "The Darkness," I quoted rabbinical sources on the "exceedingly strong
west wind" that endured for seven days when the land was enveloped in darkness, and the
hieroglyphic inscription from el-Arish about "nine days of upheaval" when "there was such a
tempest" that nobody could leave the palace or see the faces of those beside him, and the
eleventh tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh which says that "six days and a night . . . the hurricane,
deluge, and tempest continued sweeping the land," and mankind perished almost altogether. In
the battle of the planet-god Marduk with Tia-mat, "he [Marduk] created the evil wind, and the
tempest, and the hurricane, and the fourfold wind, and the sevenfold wind, and the whirlwind,
and the wind which had no equal." 6
The Maoris narrate7 that amid a stupendous catastrophe "the mighty winds, the fierce squalls,
the clouds, dense, dark, fiery, wildly drifting, wildly bursting," rushed on creation, in their midst
Tawhiri-ma-tea, father of winds and storms, and swept away giant forests and lashed the waters
into billows whose crests rose high like mountains. The earth groaned terribly, and the ocean
fled.
"The earth was submerged in the ocean but was drawn by Tefaafa-nau," relate the aborigines of
Paumotu in Polynesia. The new isles "were bated by a star." In the month of March the
Polynesians celebrate a god, Taafanua.8 "In Arabic, Tyfoon is a whirlwind and Tufan is the

the name Typhon, as if the storm were calling him by name.
* The cosmic upheaval proceeded with a "mighty strong west wind," 10 but before the climax, in
the simple words of the Scriptures, "the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all
that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided." u
-The Israelites were on the shore of the Sea of Passage at the climax of the cataclysm. The name
Jam Suf is generally rendered as Red Sea; the Passage is supposed to have taken place either at
the Gulf of Suez or at Akaba Gulf of the Red Sea, but sometimes the site of the Passage is
identified as one of the inner lakes on the route from Suez to the Mediterranean. It is argued that
suf means "reed" (papyrus reed), and since papyrus reed does not grow in salt water, Jam Suf
must have been a lagoon of fresh water.12 We will not enter here into a discussion where the Sea
of the Passage was. The inscription on the shrine found in el-Arish may provide some indication
where the Pharaoh was engulfed by the whirlpool;13 in any event, the topographical distribution
of sea and land did not remain the same as before the cataclysm of the days of the Exodus. But
the name of the Sea of the Passage—Jam Suf—is derived not from "reed," but from "hurricane,"

disappearance of the sun or change of the sky must be found accompanying the hurricane.
In the Japanese cosmogonical myth, the sun goddess hid herself for a long time in a heavenly
cave in fear of the storm god. "The source of light disappeared, the whole world became dark,"
and the storm god caused monstrous destruction. Gods made terrible noise so that the sun should
reappear, and from their tumult the earth quaked.16 In Japan and in the vast extent of the ocean
hurricanes and earthquakes are not rare occurrences; but they do not disturb the day-night
succession, nor is there any resulting permanent change in the sky and its luminaries. "The sky
was low," relate the Polynesians of Takaofo Island, and "then the winds and waterspouts and the
hurricanes came, and carried up the sky to its present height." «
"When a world cycle is destroyed by wind," says the Buddhist text on the "World Cycles," the
wind also turns "the ground upside down, and throws it into the sky," and "areas of one hundred
leagues in extent, two hundred, three hundred, five hundred leagues in extent, crack and are
thrown upward by the force of the wind" and do not fall again but are "blown to powder in the
sky and annihilated." "And the wind throws up also into the sky the mountains which encircle
the earth . . . [they] are ground to powder and destroyed." The cosmic wind blows and destroys
"a hundred thousand times ten million worlds." 18
The Tide
The ocean tides are produced by the action of the sun and to a larger extent by that of the moon.

the waters of the oceans miles high.1 The slowing down or stasis of the earth in its rotation
would cause a tidal recession of water toward the poles,2 but the celestial body near by would
disturb this poleward recession, drawing the water toward itself.
The traditions of many peoples persist that seas were torn apart and their water heaped high and
thrown upon the continents. In order to establish that these traditions refer to one and the same
event, or at least to an event of the same order, we must keep to this guiding sequence: the great
tide followed a disturbance in the motion of the earth.
The Chinese annals, which I have mentioned and which I intend to quote more extensively in a
subsequent section, say that in the time of Emperor Yahou the sun did not go down for ten davs.
The world was in flames, and "in their vast extent" the waters "overtopped the great heights,
threatening the heavens with their floods." The water of the ocean was heaped up and cast upon
the continent of Asia; a great tidal wave swept over the mountains and broke in the middle of the
Chinese Empire. The water was caught in the valleys between the mountains, and the land was
flooded for decades.

robin-bobin

The traditions of the people of Peru tell that for a period of time equal to five days and five
nights the sun was not in the sky, and then the ocean left the shore and with a terrible din broke
over the continent; the entire surface of the earth was changed in this catastrophe.3
The Choctaw Indians of Oklahoma relate: "The earth was plunged in darkness for a long time."
Finally a bright light appeared in the north, "but it was mountain-high waves, rapidly coming
nearer."4
In these traditions there are two concurrent elements: a complete darkness that endured a number
of days (in Asia, prolonged day)
1 Cf. J. Lalande, AbrSge cTastronomie (1795), p. 340, who computed that a comet with a head
as large as the earth, at a distance of 13,290 lieues, or about four diameters of the earth, would
raise ocean tides 2,000 toises or about four kilometers high.

and, when the light broke through, a mountain-high wave that brought destruction.
>-The Hebrew story of the passage of the sea contains the same elements. There was a prolonged
and complete darkness (Exodus 10:21). The last day of the darkness was at the Red Sea.5 When
the world plunged out of darkness, the bottom of the sea was uncovered, the waters were driven
apart and heaped up like walls in a double tide.6 The Septuagint translation of the Bible says that
the water stood "as a wall," and the Koran, referring to this event, says 'like mountains." In the
old rabbinical literature it is said that the water was suspended as if it were "glass, solid and
massive." 7
The commentator Rashi, guided by the grammatical structure of the sentence in the Book of
Exodus, explained in accordance with Mechilta: "The water of all oceans and seas was divided."
8
The Midrashim contain the following description: "The waters were piled up to the height of
sixteen hundred miles, and they could be seen by all the nations of the earth." 9 The figure in this
sentence intends to say that the heap of water was tremendous. According to the Scriptures, the
waters climbed the mountains and stood above them, and they mounted to the heavens.10
A sea rent apart was a marvelous spectacle and could not have been forgotten. It is mentioned in
numerous passages in the Scriptures. "The pillars of heaven tremble. . . . He divideth the sea with
his power." u "Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers. . . . He divided the sea, and
caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap."12 "He gathereth the

shattered in the same fury. The tribes of Israel on the shore of a sea found in this annihilation
their salvation from bondage. They escaped destruction but their oppressors perished before their
eyes. They extolled the Creator, took upon themselves the burden of moral rules, and considered
themselves chosen for a great destiny.

When the Spaniards conquered Yucatan, Indians versed in their ancient literature related to the
conquerors the tradition handed down to them by their ancestors: their forefathers were delivered
from pursuit by some other people when the Lord opened for them a way in the midst of the
sea.18
This tradition is so similar to the Jewish tradition of the Passage that some of the friars who came
to America believed that the Indians of America were of Jewish origin. Friar Diego de Landa
wrote: "Some old men of Yucatan say that they have heard from their ancestors that this country
was peopled by a certain race who came from the east, whom God delivered by opening for them
twelve roads through the sea. If this is true, all the inhabitants of the Indies must be of Jewish
descent." 16
It may have been an echo of what happened at the Sea of Passage, or a description of a similar
occurrence at the same time but in another place.

"trembled with terror so that the upper layers of the earth fell away and many of the people were
hurled down into those caved-in places to perish." "And Jubmel, the heaven-lord himself, came
down. . . . His terrible anger flashed like red, blue, and green fire-serpents, and people hid their
faces, and the children screamed with fear. . . . The angry god spoke: 1 shall reverse the world. I
shall bid the rivers flow upward; I shall cause the sea to gather together itself up into a huge
towering wall which I shall hurl upon your wicked earth-children, and thus destroy them and all
life.'"
Jubmel set a storm-wind blowing, and the wild air-spirits raging. . . . Foaming, dashing, rising
sky-high came the sea-wall, crushing all things. Jubmel, with one strong upheaval, made the
earth-lands all turn over; then, the world again he righted. Now the mountains and the highlands
could no more be seen by Beijke [sun]. Filled with groans of dying people, was the fair earth,
home of mankind. No more Beijke shone in heaven.
According to the Lapland epic, the world was overwhelmed by the hurricane and the sea, and
almost all human beings perished. After the sea-wall fell on the continent, gigantic waves
continued to roll and dead bodies were dashed about in dark waters.
The great earthquake and the chasms that opened in the ground, the appearance of a celestial
body with serpentlike flashes, rivers flowing upward, a sea-wall that crushed everything,
mountains that became leveled or covered with water, the world that was turned over and then
righted, the sun that no more shone in the sky—all these are motifs which we found in the
description of the calamities of the time of the Exodus.
In many places of the world, and especially in the north, large boulders are found in a position
which proves that a great force must have lifted them up and carried them long distances before
depositing them where they are found today. Sometimes these large loose
WORLDS IN COLLISION
75
rocks are of entirely different mineral composition than the local rocks, but are akin to
formations many miles away. Thus, occasionally an erratic boulder of granite perches on top of a
high ridge of dolerite, whereas the nearest outcrops of granite lie far away. These erratic boulders
may weigh as much as ten thousand tons, about as much as one hundred thirty thousand
people.18
To explain these facts, the scholars of the first half of the nineteenth century assumed that
enormous tides had swept over the continents and carried with them masses of stone. The

robin-bobin

transfer of the rocks was explained by the tides, but what could have caused those billows to rise
high over the continents?
"It was conceived that somehow and somewhere in the far north a series of gigantic waves was
mysteriously propagated. These waves were supposed to have precipitated themselves upon the
land, and then swept madly on over mountain and valley alike, carrying along with them a
mighty burden of rocks and stones and rubbish. Such deluges were styled 'waves of translation';
and the till was believed to represent the materials which they hurried along with them in their
wild course across the country." 10 The stones and boulders on the hilltops and the mounds of
sand and gravel in the lowlands were explained by this theory. Critics, however, maintained that
"it was unfortunate for this view that it violated at the very outset the first principles of science,
by assuming the former existence of a cause which there was little in nature to warrant . . .
spasmodic rushes of the sea across a whole country had fortunately never been experienced
within the memory of man." 20 That the correctness of the last sentence is questionable is shown
by references to the traditions of a number of peoples.
Wherever possible, the movement of stones was attributed to the progress of the ice sheet in the
glacial ages and to glaciers on the mountain slopes.
18 The Madison boulder near Conway, New Hampshire, measures 90 by 40 by 38 feet, and
weighs almost 10,000 tons. "It is composed of granite, quite unlike the bedrock beneath it; hence
the boulder is typically 'erratic'" Daly, The Changing World of the Ice Age, p. 16.
19 J. Geikie, The Great Ice Age and Its Relation to the Antiquity of Man (1894), pp. 25-26.

Agassiz, in 1840, assumed that just as the Alpine moraines were left behind by the retreating
glaciers, so the moraines in the flat-lands of northern Europe and America could have been
caused by the movement of great continental ice sheets (and thus introduced the theory of ice
ages). Although this is correct to some extent, the analogy is not exact, as the glaciers of the Alps
push the stones down, not up the slope. Meeting an upward motion of the ice, large boulders
would probably sink into the ice.
The problem of the migration of the stones must be regarded as only partially connected with the
progress and retreat of the ice sheet, if at all. Billows miles high traveled over the land,
originating in causes described in this book.
It can be established by the extent of denudation of the rocks under the erratic boulders that the
latter were deposited at their places during human history. So, for instance, in Wales and
Yorkshire, where this effect was evaluated in terms of time, the "amount of denudation of
limestone rocks on which boulders lie" is a "proof that a period of no more than six thousand
years has elapsed since the boulders were left in their positions." 21
The fact that accumulations of stones were transferred from the equator toward the higher
latitudes, an enigmatic problem in the ice theory, can be explained by the poleward recession of
the equatorial waters at the moment the velocity of rotation of the earth was reduced or its poles
were shifted. In the Northern Hemisphere, in India, the moraines were carried from the equator
not only toward higher latitudes, but also toward the Himalaya Mountains, and in the Southern
Hemisphere from the equatorial regions of Africa toward the higher latitudes, across the prairies
and deserts and forests of the black continent.
The Battle in the Sky
At the same time that the seas were heaped up in immense tides, a pageant went on in the sky
which presented itself to the horrified onlookers on earth as a gigantic battle. Because this battle
was seen

from almost all parts of the world, and because it impressed itself very strongly upon the
imagination of the peoples, it can be reconstructed in some detail.

When the earth passed through the gases, dust, and meteorites of the tail of the comet, disturbed
in rotation, it proceeded on a distorted orbit. Emerging from the darkness, the Eastern
Hemisphere faced the head of the comet. This head only shortly before had passed close to the
sun and was in a state of candescence. The night the great earthquake shook the globe was,
according to rabbinical literature, as bright as the day of the summer solstice. Because of the
proximity of the earth, the comet left its own orbit and for a while followed the orbit of the earth.
The great ball of the comet retreated, then again approached the earth, shrouded in a dark column
of gases which looked like a pillar of smoke during the day and of fire at night, and the earth
once more passed through the atmosphere of the comet, this time at its neck. This stage was
accompanied by violent and incessant electrical discharges between the atmosphere of the tail
and the terrestrial atmosphere. There was an interval of about six days between these two close
approaches. Emerging from the gases of the comet, the earth seems to have changed the direction
of its rotation, and the pillar of smoke moved to the opposite horizon.1 The column looked like a
gigantic moving serpent.
When the tidal waves rose to their highest point, and the seas were torn apart, a tremendous
spark flew between the earth and the globe of the comet, which instantly pushed down the mileshigh billows. Meanwhile, the tail of the comet and its head, having become entangled with each
other by their close contact with the earth, exchanged violent discharges of electricity. It looked
like a battle between the brilliant globe and the dark column of smoke. In the exchange of
electrical potentials, the tail and the head were attracted one to the other and repelled one from
the other. From the serpentlike tail extensions grew, and it lost the form of a column. It looked
now like a furious animal with legs and with many heads. The discharges tore the column to
pieces, a process that was accompanied by a rain of
1 Cf. Exodus 14 : 19.
78
WORLDS IN COLLISION
meteorites' upon the earth. It appeared as though the monster were defeated by the brilliant globe
and buried in the sea, or wherever the meteorites fell. The gases of the tail subsequently
enveloped the earth.
The globe of the comet, which lost a large portion of its atmosphere as well as much of its
electrical potential, withdrew from the earth but did not break away from its attraction.
Apparently, after a six-week interval, the distance between the earth and the globe of the comet
again diminished. This new approach of the globe could not be readily observed because the
earth was shrouded in the clouds of dust left by the comet on its former approach as well as by
dust ejected by the volcanoes. After renewed discharges, the comet and the earth parted.
This behavior of the comet is of great importance in problems of celestial mechanics. That a
comet, encountering a planet, can become entangled and drawn away from its own path, forced
into a new course, and finally liberated from the influence of the planet is proved by the case of
Lexell's comet, which in 1767 was captured by Jupiter and its moons. Not until 1779 did it free
itself from this entanglement. A phenomenon that has not been observed in modern times is an
electrical discharge between a planet and a comet and also between the head of a comet and its
trailing part.
The events in the sky were viewed by the peoples of the world as a fight between an evil monster
in the form of a serpent and the light-god who engaged the monster in battle and thus saved the
world. The tail of the comet, leaping back and forth under the discharges of the flaming globe,
was regarded as a separate body, inimical to the globe of the comet.
A full survey of the religious and folklore motifs which mirror this event would require more
space than is at my disposal here; it is difficult to find a people or tribe on the earth that does not
have the same motif at the very focus of its religious beliefs.2

and serpent, or Ormuzd and Ahriman follow an almost identical pattern and have many details in
common with the battle of Zeus and Typhon, I shall give here Apollodorus' description of this
battle.3
Typhon "out-topped all the mountains, and his head often brushed the stars. One of his hands
reached out to the west and the other to the east, and from them projected a hundred dragons'
heads. From the thighs downward he had huge coils of vipers which . . . emitted a long hissing. .
. . His body was all winged . . . and fire flashed from his eyes. Such and so great was Typhon
when, hurling kindled rocks, he made for the very heaven with hissing and shouts, spouting a
great jet of fire from his mouth." To the sky of Egypt Zeus pursued Typhon "rushing at heaven."
"Zeus pelted Typhon at a distance with thunderbolts, and at close quarters struck him down with
an adamantine sickle, and as he fled pursued him closely as far as Mount Casius, which
overhangs Syria. There, seeing the monster sore wounded, he grappled with him. But Typhon
twined about him and gripped him in his coils. . . ." "Having recovered his strength Zeus
suddenly from heaven riding in a chariot of winged horses, pelted Typhon with thunderbolts. ...
So being again pursued he [Typhon] came to Thrace and in fighting at Mount Haemus he heaved
whole mountains ... a stream of blood gushed out on the mountain, and they say that from that
circumstance the mountain was called Haemus [bloody]. And when he started to flee through the
Sicilian sea, Zeus cast Mount Etna in Sicily upon him. That is a huge mountain, from which
down to this day they say that blasts of fire issue from the thunderbolts that were thrown."
The struggle left deep marks on the entire ancient world. Some districts were especially
associated with the events of this cosmic fight. The Egyptian shore of the Red Sea was called
Typhonia.* Strabo narrates also that the Arimi (Aramaeans or Syrians) were terrified witnesses
of the battle of Zeus with Typhon. And Typhon, "who, they add, was a dragon, when struck by
the bolts of lightning, fled in search of a descent underground," 5 and not only did he cut

furrows into the earth and form the beds of the rivers, but descending underground, he made
fountains break forth.
Similar descriptions come from various places of the ancient world, in which the nations relate
the experience of their ancestors who witnessed the great catastrophe of the middle of the second
millennium.
-At that time the Israelites had not yet arrived at a clear monotheistic concept and, like other
peoples, they saw in the great struggle a conflict between good and evil. The author of the Book
of Exodus, suppressing this conception of the ancient Israelites, presented the portent of fire and
smoke moving in a column as an angel or messenger of the Lord. However, many passages in
other books of the Scriptures preserved the picture as it impressed itself upon eyewitnesses.
Rahab is the Hebrew name for the contester with the Most High. "O Lord God of hosts, who is a
strong Lord like unto thee? . . . Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces. . . . The heavens are thine, the
earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. The north
and the south thou hast created them."6 Deutero-Isaiah prayed: "Awake, awake, put on strength,
O arm of the Lord; awake as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that
hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of
the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?" 7
From these passages it is clear that the battle of the Lord with Rahab was not a primeval battle
before Creation, as some .scholars think.8
Isaiah prophesied for the future: "In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword
shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay
the dragon that is in the sea." 9
The "crooked serpent" is shown in many ancient pictures from

bound Israelites saw the upheaval of nature: darkness, hurricane, mountains of water, fire and
smoke, recorded in the Greek legend as the circumstances in which the battle of Zeus with the
dragon Typhon was fought. In the same pit of the sea lie the pharaoh and his hosts.3 s Up to now
I have identified Rahab-Typhon as a comet. But if Typhon lies on the bottom of the sea, is he not
the pharaoh? This would mean that in the legend of Typhon two elements were welded together:
the pharaoh, who perished in the catastrophe, and the outrageous rebel against Zeus, the lord of
the sky.4 \ In Pliny's Natural History, the ninety-first section of the second book reads: 5 "A
terrible comet was seen by the people of Ethiopia and Egypt, to which Typhon, the king of that
period, gave his name; it had a fiery appearance and was twisted like a coil, and it was very grim
to behold: it was not really a star so much as what might be called a ball of fire."
The visit of a disastrous comet, so many times referred to in this book, is told in plain words, not
in disguise. However, I must find support for my assumption that the comet of the days of King
Typhon was the comet of the days of the Exodus.
I investigated the writings of the old chronographers, and in Cometographia of Hevelius (1688) I
found references to the works of Calvisius, Helvicus, Herlicius, and Rockenbach, all of whom
used manuscripts for the most part and not printed sources, as they lived only a little over one
century after the invention of movable characters and the printing press. ^ Hevelius wrote (in
Latin): "In the year of the world 2453 (1495 b.c), according to certain authorities, a comet was
seen in Syria,
3 In Ages in Chaos, evidence will be presented to identify the pharaoh of the Exodus as Taui
Thom, the last king of the Middle Kingdom. He is Tau Timaeus (Tutimaeus) of Manetiio, in
whose days "a blast of God's displeasure" fell upon Egypt and terminated the period at present
known as the Middle Kingdom. The name of his queen is given in the naos of el-Arish as
Tephnut.
Ra-uah-ab is a name met among the Egyptian kings of that period (W.M.F. Petrie, A History of
Egypt, I, 227); it could have served as origin for the Hebrew word for dragon, Rahab. See note 4.
4 Actually, "dragon" became the appellation of Egyptian pharaohs in the prophetic literature. Cf.

China to India, to Persia, to Assyria, to Egypt, to Mexico. With the rise of the monotheistic
concept, the Israelites regarded this crooked serpent, the contester with the Most High, as the
Lord's own creation.
"He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. . . . The
pillars of heaven tremble. . . . He divideth the sea with his power ... his hand hath formed the
crooked serpent." 10 The Psalmist also says: " "God is my King of old. . . . Thou didst divide the
sea by thy strength. . . . Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces. . . . Thou didst cleave the
fountain and the flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers."
The sea was cleft, the earth was cut with furrows, great rivers disappeared, others appeared. The
earth rumbled for many years, and the peoples thought that the fiery dragon that had been struck
down had descended underground and was groaning there.
The Comet of Typhon
Of all the mysterious phenomena which accompanied the Exodus, this mysterious Pillar seems
the first to demand explanation.

One of the places of the heavenly combat between elementary forces of nature—as narrated by
Apollodorus and Strabo—was on the way from Egypt to Syria.1 According to Herodotus, the
final act of the fight between Zeus and Typhon took place at Lake Serbon on the coastal route

terror and strong east wind, witnessed the upheaval of the day of the Passage. These parallel

Babylonia, India, in the sign Jo, in the form of a disc, at the very time when the Israelites were
on their march from Egypt to the Promised Land. So Rockenbach. The Exodus of the Israelites is
placed by Calvisius in the year of the world 2453, or 1495 b.c." 6
I was fortunate enough to locate one copy of Rockenbach's De cometis tractatus novus
methodicus in the United States.7 This book was published in Wittenberg in 1602. Its author was
professor of Greek, mathematics, and law, and dean of philosophy at Frankfort. He wrote his
book using old sources which he did not name: "ex pro-batissimis ir antiquissimis veterum
scriptoribus" (from the most trustworthy and the most ancient of the early writers). As a result of
his diligent gathering of ancient material, he made the following entry:
"In the year of the world two thousand four hundred and fifty-three—as many trustworthy
authors, on the basis of many conjectures, have determined—a comet appeared which Pliny also
mentioned in his second book. It was fiery, of irregular circular form, with a wrapped head; it
was in the shape of a globe and was of terrible aspect. It is said that King Typhon ruled at that
time in Egypt. . . . Certain [authorities] assert that the comet was seen in Syria, Babylonia, India,
in the sign of Capricorn, in the form of a disc, at the time when the children of Israel advanced
from Egypt toward the Promised Land, led on their way by the pillar of cloud during the day and
by the pillar of fire at night." 8
Rockenbach did not draw any conclusion on the relation of the comet of the days of Exodus to
the natural phenomena of that time; his intent was only to fix the date of the comet of Typhon.

Hephaestion, and Junctinus, in addition to Pliny, mention the Typhon comet.9 It is depicted as an
immense globe (globus immodicus) of fire, also as a sickle, which is a description of a globe
illuminated by the sun, and close enough to be observed thus. Its movement was slow, its path
was close to the sun. Its color was bloody: "It was not of fiery, but of bloody redness." It caused
destruction "in rising and setting." Servius writes that this comet caused many plagues, evils, and
hunger.
To discover what were the manuscript sources of Abraham Rocken-bach that led him to the same
conclusion at which we have arrived, namely, that the Typhon comet appeared in the time of the
Exodus, is a task not yet accomplished. Servius says that more information about the calamities
caused by this comet is to be found in the writings of the Roman astrologer Campester and in the
works of the Egyptian astrologer Petosiris.10 It is possible that copies of works of some authors

robin-bobin

containing citations from the writings of these ancient astrologers, preserved in the libraries of
Europe, were Rockenbach's manuscript sources.
Campester, as quoted by Lydus, was certain that should the comet Typhon again meet the earth,
a four-day encounter would suffice to destroy the world.11 This implies also that the first
encounter with the comet Typhon brought the earth to the brink of destruction.
But even without this somber prognostication of Campester, we have a very imposing and quite
inexhaustible array of references to Typhon and its destructive action against the world: almost
every Greek author referred to it. The real nature of Typhon being that of a comet, as explained
by Pliny and others, all references to the disas9 Johannis Laurentii Lydi Liber de ostentis et calendaria Craeca omnia (ed. by C. Wachsmuth,
1897), p. 171. In this work Wachsmuth also printed excerpts from Hephaestion, Avienus apud
Servium, and Junctinus.
10 The time when Campester flourished is not Known, but it is assumed to have been in the third
or fourth century of the present era. See Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopddie der classischen
Altertumswissenschaft, s.v. The time of Petosiris is tentatively dated in the second pre-Christian
era (Pauly-Wissowa, s.v.). But he is mentioned in The Danaides of Aristophanes (—448 to—
388). See also E. Riess, Nechepsonis et Petosiridis fragmenta magica (1890).

ters caused by Typhon must be understood as descriptions of natural catastrophes in which the
earth and the comet were involved. As is known, Pallas of the Greeks was another name for
Typhon; also Seth of the Egyptians was an equivalent of Typhon.12 Thus the number of
references to the comet Typhon can be enlarged by references to Pallas and Seth.
It was not only Abraham Rockenbach who synchronized the appearance of the comet Typhon
with the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. Looking for authors who might have done likewise,
I found that Samuel Bochart, a scholarly writer of the seventeenth century, in his book
Hierozoicon,13 has a passage in which he maintains that the plagues of the days of the Exodus
resemble the calamities that Typhon brought in his train, and that therefore "the flight of Typhon
is the Exodus of Moses from Egypt."14 In this he actually follows the passage transmitted by
Plutarch.15 But since Typhon, according to Pliny and others, was a comet, Samuel Bochart was
close to the conclusions at which we arrive, traveling along another route.
The Spark
A phenomenon of great significance took place. The head of the comet did not crash into the
earth, but exchanged major electrical discharges with it. A tremendous spark sprang forth at the
moment of the nearest approach of the comet, when the waters were heaped at their highest
above the surface of the earth and before they fell down, followed by a rain of debris torn from
the very body and tail of the comet.
"And the Angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,

removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and
stood behind them . . . and it was a cloud and darkness but it gave light by night." An
exceedingly strong wind and lightnings rent the cloud. In the morning the waters rose as a wall

robin-bobin

and moved away. "And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground:
and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. And the Egyptians
pursued. . . . And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the
Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, and
took off their chariot wheels . . . and the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so
much as one of them."1
The immense tides were caused by the presence of a celestial body close by; they fell when a
discharge occurred between the earth and the other body.
Artapanus, the author of the no longer extant De Judaeis, apparently knew that the words, "The
Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud," refer to a
great lightning. Eusebius quotes Artapanus: "But when the Egyptians . . . were pursuing them, a
fire, it is said, shone out upon them from the front, and the sea overflowed the path again, and the
Egyptians were all destroyed by the fire and the flood." 2
The great discharges of interplanetary force are commemorated in the traditions, legends, and
mythology of all the peoples of the world. The god—Zeus of the Greeks, Odin of the Icelanders,
Ukko of the Finns, Perun of the Russian pagans, Wotan (Woden) of the Germans, Mazda of the
Persians, Marduk of the Babylonians, Shiva of the Hindus—is pictured with lightning in his
hand and described as the god who threw his thunderbolt at the world overwhelmed with water
and fire.

^Similarly, many psalms of the Scriptures commemorate the great discharges. "Then the earth
shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken. . . . He bowed the
heavens also, and came down ... he did fly upon the wings of the wind. . . . At the brightness that
was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. The Lord also thundered in
the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire . . . and he shot out
lightnings. . . . Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were
discovered." 3 "The voice of the Lord is powerful. . . . The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars.
. . . The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire. The voice of the Lord shaketh the
wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh."4 "The kingdoms were moved; he
uttered his voice, the earth melted."5 "The waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also
were troubled . . . the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. The voice of thy
thunder was in the heaven; the lightnings lightened the universe: the earth trembled and shook."
6 "Clouds and darkness are round about him ... a fire goeth before him and burneth up his
enemies round about. . . . His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled."7
^Nothing is easier than to add to the number of such quotations from other parts of the

With the fall of the double wall of water, the Egyptian host was swept away. The force of the
impact threw the pharaoh's army into the air. "Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in
his doing toward the children of men. He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the
flood on foot. . . . Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and
through water." 8

water is referred to also in the Egyptian source I quoted before: on the shrine found in el-Arish
the story is told of a hurricane and of a prolonged darkness when nobody could leave the palace,
and of the pursuit by the pharaoh Taoui-Thom of the fleeing slaves whom he followed to Pikhiroti, which is the biblical Pi-ha-khiroth. "His Majesty leapt into the place of the whirlpool."
Then it is said that he was 'lifted by a great force." 9
Although the larger part of the Israelite fugitives were already out of the reach of the falling tidal
waves, a great number of them perished in this disaster, as in the previous ones of fire and
hurricane of cinders. That Israelites perished at the Sea of Passage is implied in Psalm 68 where
mention is made of "my people" that remained in "the depths of the sea."
These tidal waves also overwhelmed entire tribes who inhabited Tehama, the thousand-mile-long
coastal region of the Red Sea.
"God sent against the Djorhomites swift clouds, ants, and other signs of his rage, and many of
them perished. ... In the land of Djohainah an impetuous torrent carried off all of them in a night.
The scene of this catastrophe is known by the name of Idam (fury)." The author of this passage,
Masudi, an Arab author of the tenth century, quotes an earlier author, Omeyah, son of Abu-Salt:
"In days of yore the Djorhomites settled in Tehama, and a violent flood carried all of them
away."10
Likewise the tradition related in Kitab Alaghaniu is familiar with the plague of insects (ants of
the smallest variety) that forced the tribe to migrate from Hedjaz to their native land, where they
were destroyed by "Toufan"—a deluge. In my reconstruction of ancient history, I endeavor to
establish the synchronism of these events and the Exodus.

The Collapsed Sky
The rain of meteorites and fire from the sky, the clouds of dust of exogenous origin that drifted
low, and the displacement of the world quarters created the impression that the sky had
collapsed.
The ancient peoples of Mexico referred to a world age that came to its end when the sky
collapsed and darkness enshrouded the world.1
Strabo relates, in the name of Ptolemaeus, the son of Lagus, a general of Alexander and founder
of the Egyptian dynasty called by his name, that the Celti who lived on the shores of the Adriatic
were asked by Alexander what it was they most feared, to which they replied that they feared no
one, but only that the sky might collapse.2
The Chinese refer to the collapse of the sky which took place when the mountains fell.3 Because
mountains fell or were leveled at the same time when the sky was displaced, ancient peoples, not
only the Chinese, thought that mountains support the sky.
"The earth trembled, and the heavens dropped . . . the mountains melted," says the Song of
Deborah.4 "The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself
was moved," says the psalmist.5
The tribes of Samoa in their legends refer to a catastrophe when "in days of old the heavens fell
down." The heavens or the clouds were so low that the people could not stand erect without
touching them.6
The Finns tell in their Kalevala that the support of the sky gave way and then a spark of fire
kindled a new sun and a new moon.7 The Lapps make offerings accompanied by the prayer that

should not lose its support and fall down.8 The Eskimos of Greenland are afraid that the support
of the sky may fail and the sky fall down and kill all human beings; a darkening of the sun and
the moon will precede such a catastrophe.9
The primitives of Africa, in eastern as well as western provinces of the continent, tell about the
collapse of the sky in the past. The Ovaherero tribesmen say that many years ago "the Greats of
the sky" (Eyuru) let the sky fall on the earth; almost all the people were killed, only a few
remained alive. The tribes of Kanga and Loanga also have a tradition of the collapse of the sky
which annihilated the human race. The Wanyoro in Unyoro likewise relate that the sky fell on
the earth and killed everybody: the god Kagra threw the firmament upon the earth to destroy
mankind.10
The tradition of the Cashinaua, the aborigines of western Brazil, is narrated as follows: "The
lightnings flashed and the thunders roared terribly and all were afraid. Then the heaven burst and
the fragments fell down and killed everything and everybody. Heaven and earth changed places.
Nothing that had life was left upon the earth." u
In this tradition are included the same elements: the lightnings and thunderings, "the bursting of
heaven," the fall of meteorites. About the change of places between heaven and earth there is
more to say, and I shall not postpone the subject for long.

CHAPTER 4
Boiling Earth and Sea
TWO CELESTIAL BODIES were driven near to each other. The interior of the terrestrial globe
pushed toward the exterior, The earth, disturbed in its rotation, developed heat. The land surface
became hot. Various sources of many peoples describe the melting of the earth's surface and the
boiling of the sea.
The earth burst and lava flowed. The Mexican sacred book, Popol Vuh, the Manuscript
Cakchiquel, the Manuscript Troano all record how the mountains in every part of the Western
Hemisphere simultaneously gushed lava. The volcanoes that opened along the entire chain of the
Cordilleras and in other mountain ranges and on flat land vomited fire, vapor, and torrents of
lava. These and other Mexican sources relate how, at the closing hours of the age that was
brought to an end by the rain of fire, mountains swelled under the pressure of molten masses and
new ridges rose; new volcanoes sprang out of the earth, and streams of lava flowed out of the
cleft earth.1 .-.Events underlying Greek and Mexican traditions are narrated in the Scriptures.
"The mountains shake with the swelling . . . the earth melted." 2 "Clouds and darkness . . . fire . .
. the earth saw and trembled. The hills melted like wax." 3 "He looketh on the earth, and it
trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke." * "The earth trembled . . . the mountains
melted . . . even that Sinai." 5 "He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
rivers.

The rivers steamed, and even the bottom of the sea boiled here and there. "The sea boiled, all the
shores of the ocean boiled, all the middle of it boiled," says the Zend-Avesta. The star Tistrya
made the sea boil.7
The traditions of the Indians retain the memory of this boiling of the water in river and sea. The
tribes of British Columbia tell: "Great clouds appeared . . . such a great heat came, that finally
the water boiled. People jumped into the streams and lakes to cool themselves, and died." 8 On
the North Pacific coast of America the tribes insist that the ocean boiled: "It grew very hot . . .
many animals jumped into the water to save themselves, but the water began to boil." 9 The
Indians of the Southern Ute tribe in Colorado record in their legends that the rivers boiled.10
Jewish tradition, as preserved in the rabbinical sources, declares that the mire at the bottom of
the Sea of Passage was heated. "The Lord fought against the Egyptians with the pillar of cloud
and fire. The mire was heated to the boiling point by the pillar of fire." n The rabbinical sources
say also that the pillar of fire and of smoke leveled mountains.12
Hesiod in his Theogony, relating the upheaval caused by a celestial collision, says: "The huge
earth groaned. ... A great part of the huge earth was scorched by the terrible vapor and melted as
tin melts when heated by man's art . . . or as iron, which is hardest of all things, is softened by
glowing fire in mountain glens."13

According to the traditions of the New World, the profile of the land changed in a catastrophe,
new valleys were formed, mountain ridges were torn apart, new gulfs were cut out, ancient
heights were overturned and new ones sprang up. The few survivors of the ruined world were
enveloped in darkness, "the sun in some way did not exist," and in intervals in the light of
blazing fires they saw the silhouettes of new mountains.
The Mayan sacred book Popol-Vuh says that the god "rolled mountains" and "removed
mountains," and "great and small mountains moved and shaked." Mountains swelled with lava.
Coniraya-Vira-cocha, the god of the Incas raised mountains from the flat land and flattened other
mountains.14
> And similarly, "When Israel went out of Egypt . . . the sea saw and fled . . . the mountains
skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. . . . Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the
Lord."1S
"Which removeth the mountains . . . which overturneth them in his anger; which shaketh the
earth out of her place . . . which com-mandeth the sun and it riseth not . . . which alone spreadeth
out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea."16
Mount Sinai
Along the eastern shore of the Red Sea there stretches a mountain^ ous crest with a number of
volcanic craters, at present extinguished; some, however, were active not many centuries ago.
One of these volcanoes is usually described as the Mount of the Lawgiving: In the seventies of
the last century a scholar, Charles Beke, suggested that Mount Sinai was a volcano in the
Arabian Desert.1 The Book of Deuteronomy (4:11) says "the mountain burned with fire unto the

robin-bobin

midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness." Beke's idea was rejected by his
contemporaries and ultimately by himself.2 Modern scholars, however, agree with his original
theory,

and forthis reason they look for the Mount of the Lawgiving among the volcanoes of Mount Seir
and not on the traditional Sinai Peninsula where there are no volcanoes. Thus the claims of the
rival peaks of the Sinai Peninsula for the honor of being the Mount of the Law-giving 3 are
silenced by new contestants.
'It is true that it is stated "the mountains melted . . . even that Sinai," * but this melting of
summits does not necessarily mean an opening up of craters. Rocks turned into a flowing mass.
The plateau of the Sinai Peninsula is covered with formations of basalt lava; 5 wide stretches of
the Arabian Desert also glisten with lava.6 Lava formations, interspersed with extinguished
volcanoes, stretch from the vicinity of Palmyra southward into Arabia as far as Mecca.7 Only a
few thousand years ago the deserts glowed with the beacons of many volcanoes, mountains
melted, and lava flowed over the ground from numerous Assures.
-The celestial body that the great Architect of nature sent close to the earth, made contact with it
in electrical discharges, retreated, and approached again. If we are to believe the Scriptural data,
there elapsed seven weeks, or by another computation, about two months 8 from the day of the
Exodus to the day of the revelation at Mount Sinai.
**There were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the
trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. . . . And mount
Sinai was altogether on a smoke . . . and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace,
and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and
waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice." 9

The Talmud and Midrashim describe the Mountain of the Law-giving as quaking so greatly that
it appeared as if it were lifted up and shaken above the heads of the people; and the people felt as
it they were no longer standing securely on the ground, but were held up by some invisible
force.10 The presence of a heavenly body overhead caused this phenomenon and this feeling.
"Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken,
because he was wroth. . . . He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under
his feet. ... At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of
fire. The Lord also thundered in the heavens . . . hail stones and coals of fire. . . . He shot out
lightnings. . . . Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were
discovered." n
Earth and heaven participated in the cosmic convulsion. In the Fourth Book of Ezra the
occurrences witnessed at Mount Sinai are described in these words: "Thou didst bow down the

robin-bobin

heavens, didst make the earth quake, and convulsed the world. Thou didst cause the deeps to
tremble and didst alarm the spheres." 12
The approach of a star toward the earth in the days of the revelation at Sinai is implied by the
text of the Tractate Shabbat: Although the ancestors of the later proselytes were not present at
the Mountain of the Lawgiving, their star was there close by.13
An author of the first century of the present era, whose work on biblical antiquities has been
ascribed to Philo, the Alexandrian philosopher, thus describes the commotion on the earth below
and in the sky above: "The mountain [Sinai] burned with fire and the earth shook and the hills
were removed and the mountains overthrown; the depths boiled, and all the inhabitable places
were shaken . . . and flames of fire shone forth and thunderings and lightnings were

multiplied, and winds and tempests made a roaring: the stars were gathered together
[collided]."14 Referring to the verse, "He bowed the heavens also, and came down" (Psalms 18),
Pseudo-Philo describes the events of Mount Sinai and says that the Lord "impeded the course of
the stars."15 "The earth was stirred from her foundation, and the mountains and the rocks
trembled in their fastenings, and the clouds lifted up their waves against the flame of the fire that
it should not consume the world . . . and all the waves of the sea came together."16
The Hindus depict the cosmic catastrophe at the end of a world age: "The whole world breaks
into flames. So also a hundred thousand times ten million worlds. All the peaks of Mount Sineru,
even those which are hundreds of leagues in height, crumble and disappear in the sky. The
flames of fire rise up and envelop the heaven." 17 The sixth sun or sun age ended. Similarly, in
the Jewish tradition, with the revelation at Sinai the sixth world age was terminated and the
seventh began.18
Theophany
Earthquakes are often accompanied by a roaring noise that comes from the bowels of the earth.
This phenomenon was known to early geographers. Pliny * wrote that earthquakes are "preceded
or accompanied by a terrible sound." Vaults supporting the ground give way and it seems as
though the earth heaves deep sighs. The sound was attributed to the gods and called theophany.
The eruptions of volcanoes are also accompanied by loud noises. The sound produced by
Krakatoa in the East Indies, during the eruption of 1883, was so loud that it was heard as far as
Japan, 3,000 miles away, the farthest distance traveled by sound recorded in modern annals.2

and all volcanoes vomited lava and all continents quaked, the earth groaned almost unceasingly.
At an initial stage of the catastrophe, according to Hebrew tradition, Moses heard in the silence
of the desert the sound which he interpreted to mean, "I am that I am." 3 "I am Yahweh," heard
the people in the frightful night at the Mountain of the Lawgiving.4 "The whole mount quaked
greatly" and "the voice of the trumpet sounded long." 5 "And all the people saw the roars, and

robin-bobin

the torches, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it,
they trembled, and stood afar off."6
It was a perfect setting for hearing words in the voice of nature in an uproar. An inspired leader
interpreted the voice he heard, ten long, trumpetlike blasts. The earth groaned: for weeks now all
its strata had been disarranged, its orbit distorted, its world quarters displaced, its oceans thrown
upon its continents, its seas turned into deserts, its mountains upheaved, its islands submerged,
its rivers running upstream—a world flowing with lava, shattered by meteorites, with yawning
chasms, burning naphtha, vomiting volcanoes, shaking ground, a world enshrouded in an
atmosphere filled with smoke and vapor.
Twisting of strata and building of mountains, earthquakes and rumbling of volcanoes joined in
an infernal din. It was a voice not only in the desert of Sinai; the entire world must have heard it.
"The sky and the earth resounded . . . mountains and hills were moved," says the Midrash. "Loud
did the firmament roar, and earth with echo resounded," says the epic of Gilgamesh.7 In Hesiod
"the huge earth groaned" when Zeus lashed Typhon with his bolts—"the earth resounded
terribly, and the wide heaven above." 8
The approach of two charged globes toward each other could also produce trumpetlike sounds,
varying as the distance between them increased or lessened.9 It appears that this phenomenon is
described

by Pseudo-Philo as "testimony of the trumpets between the stars and their Lord."10 Here we can
trace the origin of the Pythagorean notion of the "music of the spheres" and the idea that stars
make music. In Babylonia the spheres of the planets were called "voices" and they were
supposed to produce music.11 According to Midrashic literature, the trumpet sounding at Mount
Sinai had seven different pitches (or notes), and the rabbinical literature speaks of "the heavenly
music" heard at the revelation. "At the first sound the sky and the earth moved, the seas and the
rivers turned to flight, mountains and hills were loosened in their foundations." 12
Homer depicts a similar occurrence in these words: "The wide earth rang, and round about great
heaven pealed as with a trumpet." 13 "The world all burns at the blast of the horn," is said in the
Voluspa.14
"'According to the Hebrew tradition, all the nations heard the roaring of the lawgiving. It appears
that at Mount Sinai the sound that "sounded long" rose ten times; in this roaring the Hebrews
heard the Decalogue.
'"'-'Thou shalt not kill" (Lo tirzah); "Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Lo tin of); "Thou shalt not
steal" (Lo tignov). . . . "These words [of the Decalogue] . . . were not heard by Israel alone, but
by the inhabitants of all the earth. The Divine voice divided itself into the seventy tongues of
men, so that all might understand it. . . . The souls of the heathens almost fled from them when
they heard it."15
The din caused by the groaning earth repeated itself again and again, but not so loud, as
subterranean strata readjusted themselves after being dislocated; earthquakes incessantly shook
the ground for years. The Papyrus Ipuwer calls these years "years of noise." "Years

of noise. There is no end to noise," and again, "Oh, that the earth would cease from noise, and
tumult (uproar) be no more."18
The sound probably had the same pitch all over the world as it came from the deep interior of the
earth, all of whose strata were dislocated when it was thrown from its orbit and forced from its
axis.
The great king-lawgiver of China, in whose time a dreadful cataclysm took place and the order
of nature was disturbed, bore the name Yahou.17 In the Preface to the Shu King, attributed to
Confucius, it is written: "Examining into antiquity, we find that the Emperor Yaou was called
Fang-heun." 18 Yahou was a surname given to him in the time following the flood, apparently
inspired by the sound of the earth's groaning.
The same sound was heard in those years in the Western Hemisphere or wherever the ancestors
of the Indians then lived. They relate that once when the heavens were very close to the earth, all
mankind lifted the sky little by little at the repeated shouting 'Tahu," which rang all over the
world.19
In Indonesia an oath is accompanied by the invocation of the heavenly bodies. An arrow is shot
toward the sky, "while all present raise a cry of 'ju ju huwe.'" z0 The same sound is heard in the
very name Jo, Jove (Jupiter). The name Yahweh is preserved in shorter
16 Papyrus Ipuwer 4 : 2, 4-5.
17 For the Chinese pronunciation of this name see R. van Bergen, Story of China (1902), p. 112:
"At the time of the flood, the Emperor of China was named Yau (Yah-oo)."

name of the king; his later spelling is different.

Thom (Greek "Tau Timaeus") of the Thirteenth Dynasty, the last of the Middle Kingdom. He
was a contemporary of this Chinese king.

forms, as well, Yahou and Yo,21 as the name of the Deity in the Bible.22 Diodorus wrote of
Moses that he had received his laws from the God invoked by the name Iao.23
In Mexico, Yao or Yaotl is the god of war; the similarity of sound has already been noted.24
Nihongi, chronicles of Japan from the earliest times, begins with a reference to the time when "of
old, heaven and earth were not yet separated, and the In and Yo not yet divided." Yo is the earth.
The time when the sky touched the earth is the time when the heavy dust and vapor-charged
clouds of the comet enveloped the globe and lay very close to the ground.
Emperor Yahou
The history of China is commonly supposed to extend back to gray antiquity. But in reality the
sources of the ancient period of the Chinese past are very scanty, for they were destroyed by the
Emperor Tsin-chi-hoang (246-209 before the present era). He ordered all books on history and
astronomy, as well as works of classic literature, to be burned. Search for these books was made
throughout the empire for this purpose. The story persists that a few remnants of the old
literature were again put into writing from the memory of an old man; some were said to have

Of these few remains of the old lore, the most cherished are those which tell of the Emperor
Yahou and his times. His personality and his period are considered as "the most auspicious in the
Chinese annals."1 The history of China preceding his reign is ascribed to the
21 Psalms 68 : 4.

mythical period of the Chinese past. In the days of Yahou the event occurred which separates the
almost obliterated and very dim past of China from the period that is considered historical: China
was overwhelmed by an immense catastrophe.
"At that time the miracle is said to have happened that the sun during a span of ten days did not
set, the forests were ignited, and a multitude of abominable vermin was brought forth." a "In the
lifetime of Yao [Yahou] the sun did not set for ten full days and the entire land was flooded." 3
An immense wave "that reached the sky" fell down on the land of China. "The water was well up
on the high mountains, and the foothills could not be seen at all." 4 (This recalls Psalm 104: "The
waters stood above the mountains . . . they go up by the mountains" and Psalm 107: "The waves
mount up to the heaven.")
"Destructive in their overflow are the waters of the inundation," said the emperor. "In their vast
extent they embrace the hills and overtop the great heights, threatening the heavens with their
floods." The emperor ordered that all efforts be made to open outlets for the waters that were
caught in the valleys between the mountains. For many years the population labored, trying to
free the plains and valleys of the waters of the flood by digging channels and draining the fields.
For a considerable number of years all efforts were in vain. The minister who was in charge of
this urgent and immense work, Khwan, was sentenced to death because of his failure— "For
nine years he labored, but the work was unaccomplished" 5—and only his son Yu succeeded in
draining the land. This achievement was so highly rated that Yu became emperor of China after
King Shun, first successor to Yahou. This Yu was the founder of the new and notable dynasty
called by his name.

lives lost in a single overflow of the Yellow River.6 Another natural catastrophe—the
earthquake—also caused great devastation in China at various times: it is estimated that in the
year 1556 the quaking earth took 830,000 lives and 3,000,000 in 1662.7 Was not the catastrophe
of the time of Yahou one of the major inundations of rivers, as modern scholars suppose it to
have been? But the fact that this catastrophe has been vivid in traditions for thousands of years,
while neither the overflow of the Yellow River, when a million people perished, nor the great
earthquakes, play a conspicuous part in the recollections of the nation, is an argument against the
established interpretation.
Rivers do not overflow in the form of a sky-high wave. The overflowing rivers of China subside
in a few weeks, and the water does not remain in the plains until the following spring, but flows
away, and the ground dries in a few more weeks. The flood of Yahou required draining for many
years, and during all this period water covered the lower part of the country.

Yahou's reign is remembered for the following undertaking: This emperor sent scholars to
different parts of China, and even to Indo-China, to find out the location of north, west, east, and
south by observing the direction of the sun's rising and setting and the motion of the stars. He
also charged his astronomers to find out the duration of seasons, and to draw up a new calendar.
The Shu King is called the oldest book of Chinese chronicles, rewritten from memory or from
some hidden manuscript after the burning of books by Tsin-chi-hoang. In its oldest section, the
canon of Yaou [Yahou], it is written:
"Thereupon Yaou [Yahou] commanded He and Ho, in reverent accordance with the wide
heavens, to calculate and delineate the movements and appearances of the sun, the moon, the
stars, and the zodiacal spaces; and to deliver respectfully the seasons to the people." *

The necessity, soon after the flood, of finding anew the four directions and learning anew the
movements of the sun and the moon, of delineating the zodiacal signs, of compiling the calendar,
of informing the population of China of the sequence of the seasons, creates the impression that
during the catastrophe the orbit of the earth and the year, the inclination of the axis and the
seasons, the orbit of the moon and the month, changed. We are not told what caused the
cataclysm, but it is written in ancient annals that during the reign of Yahou "a brilliant star issued
from the constellation Yin." 9
According to the old Tibetan traditions, the highlands of Tibet, too, were flooded in a great
cataclysm.10 The traditions of the Tibetans speak also of terrifying comets that caused great
upheavals.11
Calculations were undertaken to establish the dates of the Emperor Yahou. On the basis of a
remark that the constellation Niao, thought to be the constellation Hydra, culminated at sunset on
the day of the vernal equinox in the time of Yahou, it was reckoned that the flood occurred in the
twenty-third century before the present era, but this date has been questioned by many.
Sometimes it has also been supposed that the "Flood of Yahou" was the Chinese story of the
universal flood, but this point of view has been abandoned. The story of the deluge of Noah has
its parallel in a Chinese tradition about a universal flood in prehistoric times, in the days of Fohi, who alone of all the country was saved. The flood of Yahou is sometimes regarded as
simultaneous with the flood of Ogyges.
The flood of Ogyges did not occur in the third millennium, but in the middle of the second
millennium before this era. In the section entitled "The Floods of Deucalion and Ogyges," the
synchronism of these devastations with the catastrophes of the days of Moses and Joshua will be
demonstrated and supported by ancient and chronological sources.

we have the following data: the sun did not set for a number of days, the forests were set on fire,
vermin filled the country, a high wave "reaching the sky" poured over the face of the land and
swept water over the mountain peaks and filled the valleys for many years; in the days of Yahou
the four quarters of the heaven were established anew, and observations of the duration of the
year and month and of the order of the seasons were made. The history of China in the period
before this catastrophe is quite obliterated.

All these data are in accord with the traditions of the Jewish people about the events connected
with the Exodus: the sun disappeared for a number of days; the land was filled with vermin;
gigantic sky-high tidal waves divided the sea; the world burned. As we shall see, the Hebrew
sources, too, reveal that a new calendar was established reckoning from the days of the
catastrophe and that the seasons and the four quarters of the heaven were no longer the same.
CHAPTER 5
East and West
OUR PLANET rotates from west to east. Has it always done so? In this rotation from west to
east, the sun is seen to rise in the east and set in the west. Was the east the primeval and only
place of the sunrise?
There is testimony from all parts of the world that the side which is now turned toward the
evening once faced the morning.
In the second book of his history, Herodotus relates his conversations with Egyptian priests on
his visit to Egypt some time during the second half of the fifth century before the present era.
Concluding the history of their people, the priests told him that the period following their first
king covered three hundred and forty-one generations, and Herodotus calculated that, three
generations being equal to a century, the whole period was over eleven thousand years. The
priests asserted that within historical ages and since Egypt became a kingdom, "four times in this
period (so they told me) the sun rose contrary to his wont; twice he rose where he now sets, and
twice he set where he now rises." *
This passage has been the subject of exhaustive commentaries, the authors of which tried to
invent every possible explanation of the phenomenon, but failed to consider the meaning which
was plainly stated by the priests of Egypt, and their efforts through the centuries have remained
fruitless.
The famous chronologist of the sixteenth century, Joseph Scaliger,
i Herodotus, Bk. ii, 142 (transl. A. D. Godley, 1921).

weighed the question whether the Sothis period, or time reckoning by years of 365 days which,
when compared with the Julian calendar, accumulated an error of a full year in 1,461 years, was
hinted at by this passage in Herodotus, and remarked: "Sed hoc non fuerit occa-sum et orientem
mutare" (No reversal of sunrise and sunset takes place in a Sothis period).2
Did the words of the priests to Herodotus refer to the slow change in the direction of the
terrestrial axis during a period of approximately 25,800 years, which is brought about by its
spinning or by the slow movement of the equinoctial points of the terrestrial orbit (precession of
the equinoxes)? So thought Alexander von Humboldt of "the famous passage of the second book
of Herodotus which so strained the sagacity of the commentators." 3 But this is also a violation
of the meaning of the words of the priests, for during the period of spinning, orient and Occident
do not exchange places.
One may doubt the trustworthiness of the priests' statements, or of Egyptian tradition in general,
or attack Herodotus for ignorance of the natural sciences,4 but there is no way to reconcile the
passage with present-day natural science. It remains "a very remarkable passage of Herodotus
that has become the despair of commentators."5
Pomponius Mela, a Latin author of the first century, wrote: "The Egyptians pride themselves on
being the most ancient people in the world. In their authentic annals . . . one may read that since
they have been in existence, the course of the stars has changed direction four times, and that the
sun has set twice in that part of the sky where it rises today." 6
It should not be deduced that Mela's only source for this statement was Herodotus. Mela refers
explicitly to Egyptian written sources. He mentions the reversal in the movement of the stars as
well as of the sun; if he had copied Herodotus, he would probably not have

mentioned the reversal in the movement of the stars (sidera). At a time when the movement of
the sun, planets, and stars was not yet regarded as the result of the movement of the earth, the
change in the direction of the sun was not necessarily connected in Mela's mind with a similar
change in the movement of all heavenly bodies.7
If, in Mela's time, there were Egyptian historical records which referred to the rising of the sun in
the west, we ought to investigate the old Egyptian literary sources extant today.
The Magical Papyrus Harris speaks of a cosmic upheaval of fire and water when "the south
becomes north, and the Earth turns over." 8
In the Papyrus Ipuwer it is similarly stated that "the land turns round [over] as does a potter's
wheel" and the "Earth turned upside down." 9 This papyrus bewails the terrible devastation
wrought by the upheaval of nature. In the Ermitage Papyrus (Leningrad, 1116b recto) also,
reference is made to a catastrophe that turned the 'land upside down; happens that which never
(yet) had happened."10 It is assumed that at that time—in the second millennium—people were
not aware of the daily rotation of the earth, and believed that the firmament with its luminaries
turned around the earth; therefore, the expression, "the earth turned over," does not refer to the
daily rotation of the globe.
Nor do these descriptions in the papyri of Leiden and Leningrad leave room for a figurative
explanation of the sentence, especially if we consider the text of the Papyrus Harris—the turning
over of the earth is accompanied by the interchange of the south and north poles.
Harakhte is the Egyptian name for the western sun. As there is but one sun in the sky, it is
supposed that Harakhte means the sun at its setting. But why should the sun at its setting be

deity different from the morning sun? The identity of the rising and the setting sun is seen by
everyone. The inscriptions do not leave any room for misunderstanding: "Harakhte, he riseth in
the west." u
The texts found in the pyramids say that the luminary "ceased to live in the Occident, and shines,
a new one, in the orient."12
After the reversal of direction, whenever it may have occurred, the words "west" and "sunrise"
were no longer synonyms, and it was necessary to clarify references by adding: "the west which
is at the sun-setting." It was not mere tautology, as the translator of this text thought.13
Inasmuch as the hieroglyphics were deciphered in the nineteenth century, it would be only
reasonable to expect that since then the commentaries on Herodotus and Mela would have been
written after consulting the Egyptian texts.
In the tomb of Senmut, the architect of Queen Hatshepsut, a panel on the ceiling shows the
celestial sphere with the signs of the zodiac and other constellations in "a reversed orientation" of
the southern sky.14
The end of the Middle Kingdom antedated the time of Queen Hatshepsut by several centuries.
The astronomical ceiling presenting a reversed orientation must have been a venerated chart,
made obsolete a number of centuries earlier.

robin-bobin

"A characteristic feature of the Senmut ceiling is the astronomically objectionable orientation of
the southern panel." The center of this panel is occupied by the Orion-Sirius group, in which
Orion appears west of Sirius instead of east. "The orientation of the southern panel is such that
the person in the tomb looking at it has to lift his head and face north, not south." "With the
reversed orientation of the south panel, Orion, the most conspicuous constellation of the

The real meaning of "the irrational orientation of the southern panel" and the "reversed position
of Orion" appears to be this: the southern panel shows the sky of Egypt as it was before the
celestial sphere interchanged north and south, east and west. The northern panel shows the sky of
Egypt as it was on some night of the year in the time of Senmut.
Was there no autochthonous tradition in Greece about the reversals of the revolution of the sun
and stars?
Plato wrote in his dialogue, "The Statesman" (Politicus): "I mean the change in the rising and
setting of the sun and the other heavenly bodies, how in those times they used to set in the
quarter where they now rise, and used to rise where they now set . . . the god at the time of the
quarrel, you recall, changed all that to the present system as a testimony in favor of Atreus."
Then he proceeded: "At certain periods the universe has its present circular motion, and at other
periods it revolves in the reverse direction. ... Of all the changes which take place in the heavens
this reversal is the greatest and most complete."16
Plato continued his dialogue, using the above passage as the introduction to a fantastic
philosophical essay on the reversal of time. This minimizes the value of the quoted passage
despite the categorical form of his statement.
The reversal of the movement of the sun in the sky was not a peaceful event; it was an act of
wrath and destruction. Plato wrote in Politicus: "There is at that time great destruction of animals
in general, and only a small part of the human race survives."
The reversal of the movement of the sun was referred to by many Greek authors before and after
Plato. According to a short fragment of a historical drama by Sophocles (Atreus), the sun rises in

only since its course was reversed. "Zeus . . . changed the course of the sun, causing it to rise in
the east and not in the west."17
Euripides wrote in Electra: "Then in his anger arose Zeus, turning the stars' feet back on the firefretted way; yea, and the sun's car splendour-burning, and the misty eyes of the morning grey.
And the flash of his chariot-wheels back-flying flushed crimson the face of the fading day. . . .
The sun . . . turned backward . . . with the scourge of his wrath in affliction repaying mortals."18
Many authors in later centuries realized that the story of Atreus described some event in nature.
But it could not have been an eclipse. Strabo was mistaken when he tried to rationalize the story
by saying that Atreus was an early astronomer who "discovered that the sun revolves in a
direction opposite to the movement of the heavens." 19 During the night the stars move from
east to west two minutes faster than the sun which moves in the same direction during the day.20
Even in poetical language such a phenomenon would not have been described as follows: "And

through the heavens unto where blush-burning dawn rose," as Euripides wrote in another work
of his.21
Seneca knew more than his older contemporary Strabo. In his drama Thyestes, he gave a
powerful description of what happened when the sun turned backward in the morning sky, which
reveals much profound knowledge of natural phenomena. When the sun reversed its course and
blotted out the day in mid-Olympus (noon), and the sinking sun beheld Aurora, the people,
smitten with fear,

asked: "Have we of all mankind been deemed deserving that heaven, its poles uptorn, should
overwhelm us? In our time has the last day come?" 22
The early Greek philosophers, and especially Pythagoras, would have known about the reversal
of the revolution of the sky, if it actually occurred, but as Pythagoras and his school kept their
knowledge secret, we must depend upon the authors who wrote about the Pythagoreans. Aristotle
says that the Pythagoreans differed between the right- and the left-hand motion of the sky ("the
side from which the stars rise" is heaven's right, "and where they set . . . its left"23), and in Plato
we find: "A direction from left to right—and that will be from west to east."24 The present sun
moves in the opposite direction.
In the language of a symbolic and philosophical astronomy, probably of Pythagorean origin,
Plato describes in Timaeus the effects of a collision of the earth "overtaken by a tempest of
winds" with "alien fire from without, or a solid lump of earth," or waters of "the immense flood
which foamed in and streamed out": the terrestrial globe engages in all motions, "forwards and
backwards, and again to right and to left, and upwards and downwards, wandering every way in
all the six directions."25
As the result of such a collision, described in a not easily understandable text which represents
the earth as possessing a soul, there was a "violent shaking of the revolutions of the Soul," "a
total blocking of the course of the same," "shaking of the course of the other," which "produced
all manner of twistings, and caused in their circles fractures and disruptures of every possible
kind, with the result that, as they [the earth and the "perpetually flowing stream"?] barely neld

"revolution of the other" is from west to east.27 In The Statesman, Plato put this symbolic
language into very simple terms, speaking of the reversal of the quarters in which the sun rises
and sets.

The traditions of peoples agree in synchronizing the changes in the movement of the sun with
great catastrophes which terminated world ages. The changes in the movement of the sun in each
successive age make the use by many peoples of the term "sun" for "age" understandable.
"The Chinese say that it is only since a new order of things has come about that the stars move

The sun that moves toward the east, contrary to the present sun, is called by the Indians Teotl

heavenly ball game, accompanied by upheavals and earthquakes on the earth.36
The reversal of east and west, if combined with the reversal of north and south, would turn the
constellations of the north into constellations of the south, and show them in reversed order, as in
the chart of the southern sky on the ceiling of Senmut's tomb. The stars of the north would
become stars of the south; this is what seems to be described by the Mexicans as the "driving
away of the four hundred southern stars." 37
The Eskimos of Greenland told missionaries that in an ancient time the earth turned over and the

The Koran speaks of the Lord "of two easts and of two wests," 44 a sentence which presented
much difficulty to the exegetes. Aver-rhoes, the Arab philosopher of the twelfth century, wrote

References to the reversal of the movement of the sun that have been gathered here do not refer
to one and the same time: the Deluge, the end of the Middle Kingdom, the days of the Argive
tyrants, were separated by many centuries. The tradition heard by Herodotus in Egypt speaks of
four reversals. Later in this book and again in the book that will deal with earlier catastrophes, I
shall return to this subject. At this point, I leave historical and literary evidence on the reversal of
earth's cardinal points for the testimony of the natural sciences on the reversal of the magnetic
poles of the earth.
The Reversed Polarity of the Earth
A thunderbolt, on striking a magnet, reverses the poles of the magnet. The terrestrial globe is a
huge magnet. A short circuit between it and another celestial body could result in the north and
south magnetic poles of the earth exchanging places.
It is possible to detect in the geological records of the earth the orientation of the terrestrial
magnetic field in past ages.
"When lava cools and freezes following a volcanic outburst, it takes up a permanent
magnetization dependent upon the orientation of the Earth's magnetic field at the time. This,
because of small capacity for magnetization in the Earth's magnetic field after freezing, may
remain practically constant. If this assumption be correct, the

direction of the originally acquired permanent magnetization can be determined by tests in the
laboratory, provided that every detail of the orientation of the mass tested is carefully noted and
marked when it is removed." 1
We would expect to find a full reversal of magnetic direction. Although repeated heating of lava
and rocks can change the picture, there must have remained rocks with inverted polarity.
Another1 author writes:
"Examination of magnetization of some igneous rocks reveals that they are polarized oppositely
from the prevailing present direction of the local magnetic field and many of the older rocks are
less strongly magnetized than more recent ones. On the assumption that the magnetization of the
rocks occurred when the magma cooled and that the rocks have held their present positions since
that time, this would indicate that the polarity of the Earth has been completely reversed within
recent geological times." 2
Because the physical facts seemed entirely inconsistent with every cosmological theory, the
author of the above passage was cautious not to draw further conclusions from them.
The reversed polarity of lava indicates that in recent geological times the magnetic poles of the
globe were reversed; when they had a very different orientation, abundant flows of lava took
place.
Additional problems, and of a large scope, are: whether the position of the magnetic poles has
anything to do with the direction of rotation of the globe, and whether there is an
interdependence in the direction of the magnetic poles of the sun and of the planets.
The Quarters of the World Displaced

Mela say that according to Egyp1 J. A. Fleming, "The Earth's Magnetism and Magnetic Surveys" in Terrestrial Magnetism and

tian annals, the reversal of the west and east recurred: the sun rose in the west, then in the east,
once more in the west, and again in the east.
Was the cosmic catastrophe that terminated a world age in the days of the fall of the Middle
Kingdom and of the Exodus one of these occasions, and did the earth change the direction of its
rotation at that time? If we cannot assert this much, we can at least maintain that the earth did not
remain on the same orbit, nor did its poles stay in their places, nor was the direction of the axis
the same as before. The position of the globe and its course were not settled when the earth first
came into contact with the onrushing comet; in Plato's terms, already partly quoted, the motion
of the earth was changed by "blocking of the course" and went through "shaking of the
revolutions" with "disruptures of every possible kind," so that the position of the earth became
"at one time reversed, at another oblique, and again upside down," and it wandered "every way
in all six directions."
The Talmud and other ancient rabbinical sources tell of great disturbances in the solar movement
at the time of the Exodus and the Passage of the Sea and the Lawgiving.1 In old Midrashim it is
repeatedly narrated that four times the sun was forced out of its course in the few weeks between
the day of the Exodus and the day of the Lawgiving.2
The prolonged darkness (and prolonged day in the Far East) and the earthshock (i.e., the ninth
and the tenth plagues) and the world conflagration were the result of one of these disturbances in
the motion of the earth. A few days later, if we follow the biblical narration, immediately before
the hurricane changed its direction, "the pillar of cloud went from before their faces and stood
behind them"; this means that the column of fire and smoke turned about and appeared from the
opposite direction. Mountainous tides uncovered the bottom of the sea; a spark sprang between
two celestial bodies;

and "at the turning of the morning," 3 the tides fell in a cataclysmic avalanche.
The Midrashim speak of a disturbance in the solar movement on the day of the Passage: the sun
did not proceed on its course.4 On that day, according to the Psalms (76 : 8), "the earth feared
and was still." It is possible that Amos (8 : 8-9) is reviving the memory of this event when he
mentions the "flood of Egypt," at the time "the earth was cast out of the sea, and dry land was
swallowed by the sea," and "the sun was brought down at noon," although, as I show later on,
Amos might have referred to a cosmic catastrophe of a more recent date.
Also, the day of the Lawgiving, when the worlds collided again, was, according to numerous
rabbinical sources, a day of unusual length: the motion of the sun was disturbed.5 ^^On this
occasion, and generally in the days and months following the Passage, the gloom, the heavy and
charged clouds, the lightning, and the hurricanes, aside from the devastation by earthquake and
flood, made observation very difficult, if not impossible. "They walk on in darkness: all the
foundations of the earth are out of course" (Psalms 82:5) is a metaphor used by the Psalmist.
e Papyrus Ipuwer, which says that "the earth turned over like a potter's wheel" and "the earth is
upside down," was written by an eyewitness of the plagues and the Exodus.6 The change is
described also in the words of another papyrus (Harris) which I have quoted once before: "The
south becomes north, and the earth turns over." v,Whether there was a complete reversal of the
cardinal points as a result of the cosmic catastrophe of the days of the Exodus, or only a
substantial shift, is a problem not solved here. The answer was not apparent even to
contemporaries, at least for a number of decades. In the gloom that endured for a generation,
observations were im3 Rashi, the commentator, is surprised by the combination of the words, "at the turning of the

the morning, which rises, changes to day, but does not go down.

possible, and very difficult when the light began to break through.
The Kalevala relates that "dreaded shades" enveloped the earth, and "the sun occasionally steps
from his accustomed path." T Then Ukko-Jupiter struck fire from the sun to light a new sun and
a new moon, and a new world age began.
In Voluspa (Poetic Edda) of the Icelanders we read:
No knowledge she [the sun] had where her home should be,
The moon knew not what was his,
The stars knew not where their stations were.
Then the gods set order among the heavenly bodies.
The Aztecs related: "There had been no sun in existence for many years. . . . [The chiefs] began
to peer through the gloom in all directions for the expected light, and to make bets as to what
part of heaven he [the sun] should first appear in. Some said 'Here,' and some said 'There'; but
when the sun rose, they were all proved wrong, for not one of them had fixed upon the east." 8
Similarly, the Mayan legend tells that "it was not known from where the new sun would appear."
"They looked in all directions, but they were unable to say where the sun would rise. Some
thought it would take place in the north and their glances were turned in that direction. Others
thought it would be in the south. Actually, their guesses included all directions because the dawn
shone all around. Some, however, fixed their attention on the orient, and maintained that the sun
would come from there. It was their opinion that proved to be correct." 9
According to the Compendium of Wong-shi-Shing (1526-1590), it was in the "age after the
chaos, when heaven and earth had just separated, that is, when the great mass of cloud just lifted
from the earth," that the heaven showed its face.10

In the Midrashim it is said that during the wandering in the desert the Israelites did not see the
face of the sun because of the clouds. They were also unable to orient themselves on their
march.11
The expression repeatedly used in the Books of Numbers and Joshua, "the east, to the sunrising,"
12 is not tautology, but a definition, which, by the way, testifies to the ancient origin of the
literary materials that served as sources for these books; it is an expression that has its
counterpart in the Egyptian "the west which is at the sun-setting."
The cosmological allegory of the Greeks has Zeus, rushing on his way to engage Typhon in
combat, steal Europa (Erev, the evening land) and carry her to the west. Arabia (also Erev) kept
its name, "the evening land,"13 though it lies to the east of the centers of civilization—Egypt,
Palestine, Greece. Eusebius, one of the Fathers of the Church, assigned the Zeus-Europa episode
to the time of Moses and the Deucalion Flood, and Augustine wrote that Europa was carried by
the king of Crete to his island in the west, "betwixt the departure of Israel out of Egypt and the
death of Joshua."14
The Greeks, like other peoples, spoke of the reversal of the quarters of the earth and not merely
in allegories but in literal terms.

The reversal of the earth's rotation, referred to in the written and oral sources of many peoples,
suggests the relation of one of these events to the cataclysm of the day of the Exodus. Like the
quoted passage from Visuddhi-Magga, the Buddhist text, and the cited tradition of the Cashinaua
tribe in western Brazil, the versions of the tribes and peoples of all five continents include the
same elements, familiar to us from the Book of Exodus: lightning and "the bursting of heaven,"
which caused the earth to be turned "upside down," or "heaven and earth to change places." On
the Andaman Islands the natives are afraid that a natural catastrophe will cause the world

to turn over.15 In Greenland also the Eskimos fear that the earth will turn over.16
Curiously enough, the cause of such perturbation is revealed in beliefs like that of the people of
Flanders in France. Thus we read: "In Menin (Flanders) the peasants say, on seeing a comet: 'The
sky is going to fall; the earth is turning over!'"1T
Changes in the Times and the Seasons
Many agents collaborated to change the climate. Insolation was impaired by heavy clouds of
dust, and the radiation of heat from the earth was equally hindered.1 Heat was generated by the
earth's contacts with another celestial body; the earth was removed to an orbit farther from the
sun; the polar regions were displaced; oceans and seas evaporated and the vapors precipitated as
snow on new polar regions and in the higher latitudes in a long Fimbul-winter and formed new
ice sheets; the axis on which the earth rotated pointed in a different direction, and the order of the
seasons was disturbed.
Spring follows winter and fall follows summer because the earth rotates on an axis inclined
toward the plane of its revolution around the sun. Should this axis become perpendicular to that
plane, there would be no seasons on the earth. Should it change its direction, the seasons would
change their intensity and their order.
The Egyptian papyrus known as Papyrus Anastasi IV contains a complaint about gloom and the
absence of solar light; it says also: "The winter is come as (instead of) summer, the months are
reversed and the hours are disordered." 2

"The breath of heaven is out of harmony. . . . The four seasons do not observe their proper
times," we read in the Texts of Taoism.3
In the historical memoirs of Se-Ma Ts'ien, as in the annals of the Shu King which we have
already quoted, it is said that Emperor Yahou sent astronomers to the Valley of Obscurity and to
the Sombre Residence to observe the new movements of the sun and of the moon and the
syzygies or the orbital points of the conjunctions, also "to investigate and to inform the people of
the order of the seasons." * It is also said that Yahou introduced a calendar reform: he brought

robin-bobin

the seasons into accord with the observations; he did the same with the months; and he
"corrected the days." 5
Plutarch gives the following description of a derangement of seasons: "The thickened air
concealed the heaven from view, and the stars were confused with a disorderly huddle of fire and
moisture and violent fluxions of winds. The sun was not fixed to an unwander-ing and certain
course, so as to distinguish orient and Occident, nor did he bring back the seasons in order." 6
In another work of his, Plutarch ascribes these changes to Typhon, "the destructive, diseased and
disorderly," who caused "abnormal seasons and temperatures." 7
It is characteristic that in the written traditions of the peoples of antiquity the disorder of the
seasons is directly connected with the derangement in the motion of the heavenly bodies.
The oral traditions of primitive peoples in various parts of the world also retain memories of this
change in the movement of the heavenly bodies, the seasons, the flow of time, during a period
when darkness enveloped the world. As an example I quote the tradition of the Oraibi in
Arizona. They say that the firmament hung low and the world was dark, and no sun, no moon,
nor stars were seen. "The people murmured because of the darkness and the cold." Then the

planet god Machito "appointed times, and seasons, and ways for the heavenly bodies." 8
Among the Incas the "guiding power in regulating the seasons and the courses of the heavenly
bodies" was Uira-cocha. "The sun, the moon, the day, the night, spring, winter, are not ordained
in vain by thee, O Uira-cocha." 9
The American sources, which speak of a world colored red, of a rain of fire, of world
conflagration, of new rising mountains, of frightening portents in the sky, of a twenty-five-year
gloom, imply also that "the order of the seasons was altered at that epoch." "The astronomers and
geologists whose concern is all this . . . should judge of the causes which could effect the
derangement of the day and could cover the earth with tenebrosity," wrote a clergyman who
spent many years in Mexico and in the libraries of the Old World which store ancient
manuscripts of the Mayas and works of early Indian and Spanish authors about them.10 It did
not occur to him that the biblical narrative of the time of the Exodus contains the same elements.
.->With the end of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt, when the Israelites left that country, the old
order of seasons came to an end and a new world age began. The Fourth Book of Ezra, which
borrows from some earlier sources, refers to the "end of the seasons" in these words: "I sent him
[Moses] and led my people out of Egypt, and brought them to Mount Sinai, and held him by me
for many days. I told him many wondrous things, showed him the secrets of the times, declared
to him the end of the seasons." n
J>Because of various simultaneous changes in the movement of the earth and the moon, and

"the secrets of the calendar" (sod ha-avour), or more precisely, "the secret of the transition" from

one time-reckoning to another, was revealed to Moses, but he had difficulty in comprehending it.
Moreover, it is said in rabbinical sources that in the time of Moses the course of the heavenly
bodies became confounded.12
"^>The month of the Exodus, which occurred in the spring, became the first month of the year:
"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to
you." 18 Thus, the strange situation was created in the Jewish calendar that the New Year is
observed in the seventh month of the year: the beginning of the calendar year was moved to a
point about half a year away from the New Year in the autumn.
With the fall of the Middle Kingdom and the Exodus, one of the great world ages came to its
end. The four quarters of the world were displaced, and neither the orbit nor the poles nor,
probably, the direction of rotation remained the same. The calendar had to be adjusted anew. The
astronomical values of the year and the day could not be the same before and after an upheaval
in which, as the quoted Papyrus Anastasi IV says, the months were reversed and "the hours
disordered."
"-The length of the year during the Middle Kingdom is not known from any contemporaneous
document. Because in the Pyramid texts dating from the Old Kingdom there is mention of "five
days," it was erroneously concluded that in that period a year of 365 days was already known.14
But no inscription of the Old or Middle Kingdom has been found in which mention is made of a
year of 365 days or even 360 days. Neither is any reference to a year of 365 days or to "five
days" found in the very numerous inscriptions of the New Kingdom prior to the dynasties of the
seventh century.15 Thus the infer-12 Pirkei Rabbi Elieser 8; Leket Midrashim 2a; Ginzberg, Legends, VI, 24.

ence that "the five days" of the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom signify the five days over 360
is not well founded.
There exists a direct statement found as a gloss on a manuscript of Timaeus that a calendar of a
solar year of three hundred and sixty days was introduced by the Hyksos after the fall of the
Middle Kingdom; 16 the calendar year of the Middle Kingdom apparently had fewer days. ^The
fact I hope to be able to establish is that from the fifteenth century to the eighth century before
the present era the astronomical year was equal to 360 days; neither before the fifteenth century,
nor after the eighth century was the year of this length. In a later chapter of this work extensive
material will be presented to demonstrate this point.
The number of days in a year during the Middle Kingdom was less than 360; the earth then
revolved on an orbit somewhat closer to the present orbit of Venus. An investigation into the
length of the astronomical year during the periods of the Old and Middle Kingdoms is reserved
for that part of this work which will deal with the cosmic catastrophes that occurred before the
beginning of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.
^.Here I give space to an old Midrashic source which, taking issue with a contradiction in the
scriptural texts referring to the length of time the Israelites sojourned in Egypt, maintains that
"God hastened the course of the planets during Israel's stay in Egypt," so that the sun completed
400 revolutions during the space of 210 regular years.17 These figures must not be taken as
correct, since the intention was to reconcile two biblical texts, but the reference to the different
motion of the planets in the period of the Israelites' stay in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom is
worth mentioning.

is ascribed to the Hyksos King Aseth, who also introduced the worship of the bull calf Apis.

that a new world order came into being with the end of the sixth world age at the revelation on

CHAPTER 6
The Shadow of Death
AN ENTIRE YEAR after the eruption of Krakatoa in the East - Indies in 1883, sunset and
sunrise in both hemispheres were very colorful. Lava dust suspended in the air and carried
around the globe accounted for this phenomenon.1
In 1783, after the eruption of Skaptar-Jokull in Iceland, the world was darkened for months;
records of this phenomenon are found in many contemporary authors. One German
contemporary compared the gloomy world of the year 1783 with the Egyptian plague of
darkness.2
The world was gloomy in the year of Caesar's death, —44. "After the murder of Caesar the
dictator and during the Antonine war," there was "almost a whole year's continuous gloom,"
wrote Pliny.3 Virgil described this year in these words: "The sun . . . veiled his shining face in
dusky gloom, and godless age feared everlasting night. . . . Germany heard the clash of arms
through all the sky; the Alps rocked with unwonted terrors . . . and spectres, pale in wondrous
wise, were seen at evening twilight." 4
On September 23, —44, a short while after the death of Caesar, on the very day when Octavian
performed the rites in honor of the deceased, a comet became visible at daytime; it was very
bright and

127
moved from north to west. It was seen for only a few days and vanished while still in the north.6
It appears that the gloom which enveloped the world the year after Caesar's death was caused by
the dust of the comet dispersed in the atmosphere. The "clash of arms" heard "through all the
sky" was probably the sound that accompanied the entrance of the gases and dust into the earth's
atmosphere.
If the eruption of a single volcano can darken the atmosphere over the entire globe, a
simultaneous and prolonged eruption of thousands of volcanoes would blacken the sky. And if
the dust of the comet of —44 had a darkening effect, contact of the earth with a great cindertrailing comet of the fifteenth century before this era could likewise cause the blackening of the
sky. As this comet activated all the volcanoes and created new ones, the cumulative action of the
eruptions and of the comet's dust must have saturated the atmosphere with floating particles.
Volcanoes vomit water vapor as well as cinders. The heating effect of the contact of the globe
with the comet must have caused a great evaporation from the surface of the seas and rivers.
Two kinds of clouds—water vapor and dust—were formed. The clouds obscured the sky, and
drifting very low, hung as a fog. The veil left by the gaseous trail of the hostile star and the
smoke of the volcanoes caused darkness, not complete, but profound. This condition prevailed
for decades, and only very gradually did the dust subside and the water vapors condense.

Codex Chimalpopoca, in his history of the suns, shows us terrifying celestial phenomena, twice
followed by darkness that covered the face of the earth, in one instance for a period of twentyfive years." "This fact is mentioned in the Codex Chimalpopoca and in most of the traditions of
Mexico." 7
Gomara, the Spaniard who came to the Western Hemisphere in the middle of the sixteenth
century, shortly after the conquest, wrote: 8 "After the destruction of the fourth sun, the world
plunged in darkness during the space of twenty-five years. Amid this profound obscurity, ten
years before the appearance of the fifth sun, mankind was regenerated."
In the years of this gloom, when the world was covered with clouds and shrouded in mist, the
Quiche tribe migrated to Mexico, crossing a sea enveloped in a somber fog.9 In the so-called
Manuscript Quiche it is also narrated that there was 'little light on the surface of the earth . . . the
faces of the sun and of the moon were covered with clouds." 10
In the Ermitage Papyrus in Leningrad previously mentioned there are lamentations about a
terrible catastrophe, when heaven and earth turned upside down ("I show thee the land upside
down; it happened that which never had happened"). After this catastrophe, darkness covered the
earth: "The sun is veiled and shines not in the sight of men. None can live when the sun is veiled
by clouds. . . . None knoweth that midday is there; the shadow is not discerned. . . . Not dazzled
is the sight when he [the sun] is beheld; he is in the sky like the moon." u
In this description the light of the sun is compared to the light of the moon; but even in the light
of the moon objects cast a shadow. If the midday could not be discerned, the disc of the sun was
not clearly visible, and only its diffused light made the day different from the night. The gloom
gradually lifted with the passing years as

the clouds became less thick; little by little the sky and the sun appeared less and less veiled.
~The years of darkness in Egypt are described in a number of other documents. The Papyrus
Ipuwer, which contains the story of the plagues of Egypt, says that the land is without light
[dark].12 In the Papyrus Anastasi IV the years of misery are described, and it is said: "The sun, it
hath come to pass that it riseth not." 13 ^ It was the time of the wandering of the Israelites in the
desert.14 Is there any indication that the desert was dark? Jeremiah says (2 : 6): "Neither said
they, Where is the Lord that brought vis up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the
wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of
death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?"
v->The "shadow of death" is related to the time of the wanderings in the desert after the Exodus
from Egypt. The sinister meaning of the words "shadow of death" corresponds with the
description of the Ermitage Papyrus: "None can live when the sun is veiled by clouds."
At intervals the earth was lighted by conflagrations in the desert.15 S».The phenomenon of
gloom enduring for years impressed itself on the memory of the Twelve Tribes and is mentioned
in many passages of the Bible: "Thou hast . . . covered us with the shadow of death" (Psalms 44 :
19); "The people that walked in darkness ... in the land of the shadow of death" (Isaiah 9:2). The

might be shaken out of it?" 16 ^The low and slowly drifting clouds enshrouded the wanderers in
the desert. These clouds dimly glowed at night; their upper portion reflected the sunlight. The
glow being pale during the day and red after sunset, the Israelites were able to distinguish
between day and night.17 They were protected by the clouds from the sun during the wandering
in the desert, and according to the Midrashic literature, they saw sun and moon for the first time
only at the end of the wandering.18
^The clouds that covered the desert during the wandering of the Twelve Tribes were called a
"celestial garment" or "clouds of glory." "He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light
in the night." "And the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day." 19 For days or months the
cloud tarried in one place, and the Israelites "journeyed not"; but when the cloud moved, the
wanderers followed it, and revered it because of its celestial origin.20
In Arabic sources, too, we read that the Amalekites, who left Hedjaz because of plagues,
followed the cloud in their wandering through the desert.21

the screen of clouds played an important part.22

The name "shadow of death" expresses the influence of the sunless gloom upon the life
processes. The Chinese annals of Wong-shi-Shing, in the chapter dealing with the Ten Stems

destroys the growth of all things." 25
Buddhist scholars declare that with the beginning of the sixth world age or "sun," "the whole
world becomes filled with smoke and saturated with greasiness of that smoke." There is "no
distinction of day and night." The gloom is caused by a "cycle-destroying great cloud" of cosmic
origin and dimensions.26

The Quiche tribe migrated to Mexico, the Israelites roamed in the desert, the Amalekites
migrated toward Palestine and Egypt—an uneasy movement took place in all corners of the
ruined world. The migration in Central Polynesia, shrouded in gloom, is narrated in the traditions
of the aborigines of this part of the world about a chief named Te-erui who "lived long in utter
darkness in Avaiki," who migrated in a canoe named "Weary of Darkness" to find a land of light,
and who, after many years of wandering, saw the sky clearing little by little and arrived at a
region "where they could see each other clearly." 30
In the Kalevala, the Finnish epos which "dates back to an enormous antiquity," 31 the time when
the sun and moon disappeared from the sky, and dreaded shadows covered it, is described in
these words:
Even birds grew sick and perished, men and maidens, faint and famished, perished in the cold
and darkness, from the absence of the sunshine, from the absence of the moonlight. . . . But the
wise men of the Northland could not know the dawn of morning, for the moon shines not in
season nor appears the sun at midday, from their stations in the sky-vault.32
An explanation which would rationalize this picture as the description of a seasonal long night in
northern regions will stumble over the second part of the passage: the seasons did not return in
their wonted order. The dreaded shadow covered the earth when Ukko, the highest of the Finnish
deities, relinquished the support of the heavens. Hailstones of iron rained down furiously, and
then the world became shrouded in a generation-long darkness.

of death" of the Scriptures. The entire generation of those who left Egypt perished in the lightless
desert. Vegetation died in the catastrophe. The Iranian book of Bundahis says: "Blight was
diffused over the vegetation, and it withered away immediately." 33 When the sky was shattered,
the day became dark, and the earth teemed with noxious creatures. For a long time there was no
green thing seen; seeds would not germinate in a sunless world. It took many years before the
earth again brought forth vegetation; this is told in the written and oral traditions of many
peoples. According to American sources, the regeneration of the world and of humankind took
place under the veil of the gloomy shadows, and the time is indicated as the end of the fifteenth

year of the darkness, ten years before the end of the gloom.34 In the scriptural narration it was
probably the day when Aaron's dried twig budded for the first time.35
~The eerie world, dark and groaning, was unpleasant to all the senses save the sense of smell: the
world was fragrant. When the breeze blew, the clouds conveyed a sweet odor.
In the Papyrus Anastasi IV, written "in the year of misery," in which it is said that the months are
reversed, the planet-god is described as arriving "with the sweet wind before him." 36
-In a similar text of the Hebrews we read that the times and seasons were confused, and "a
fragrance perfumed all the world," and the perfume was brought by the pillar of smoke. The
fragrance was like that of myrrh and frankincense. "Israel was surrounded by clouds," and as
soon as the clouds were set in motion, the winds "breathed myrrh and frankincense." 3T
The Vedas contain hymns to Agni which "glows from the sky." Its fragrance became the

In what way did this veil of gloom dissolve itself?
When the air is overcharged with vapor, dew, rain, hail, or snow falls. Most probably the
atmosphere discharged its compounds, presumably of carbon and hydrogen, in a similar way.
Has any testimony been preserved that during the many years of gloom carbohydrates
precipitated?
'When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it." It was like "the hoar frost
on the ground." It had the shape of coriander seed, the yellowish color of bdellium, and an oily
taste like honeycomb. It was called "corn of heaven" and it was ground between stones and
baked in pans.1 The manna fell from the clouds.2
After the nightly cooling, the carbohydrates precipitated and fell with the morning dew. The
grains dissolved in the heat and evaporated; but in a closed vessel the substance could be
preserved for a long time.3
The exegetes have endeavored to explain the phenomenon of manna and were helped by the
naturalists who discovered that a tamarisk in the desert of Sinai sheds its seeds during certain
months of the year.4 But why should this seed be called "corn of heaven,"

looked like snow and still falls in the desert, being a "mainstay to dwellers in these parts."

"bread of heaven,"5 or why should it be said it "will rain bread from heaven?" 6 It is also not
easy to explain how a multitude of men and animals could have existed for many years in a
wilderness on the scarce and seasonal seeds of some desert plant. Were such a thing possible, the
desert would be preferable to tillable land that yields bread to the laborer only in the sweat of his
brow.
• The clouds brought the heavenly bread, it is also said in the Talmud.7 But if the manna fell
from clouds that enveloped the entire world, it must have fallen not only in the Desert of
Wanderings, but everywhere; and not only the Israelites, but other peoples, too, must have tasted
it and spoken of it in their traditions.
There was a world fire, says the Icelandic tradition, followed by the Fimbul-winter, and only one
human pair remained alive in the north. "This human pair lie hidden in the holt during the fire of
Surt." Then came "the terrible Fimbul-winter at the end of the world [age]; meanwhile they feed
on morning dew, and from them come the folk who people the renewed earth." 8
Three elements are connected in the Icelandic tradition which are the same three we met in the
Israelite tradition: the world fire, the dark winter that endured many years, and the morning dew
that served as food during these years of gloom when nothing budded.
The Maoris of New Zealand tell of fiery winds and fierce clouds that lashed the waters into tidal
waves that touched the sky and were accompanied by furious hailstorms. The ocean fled. The
progeny of the storm and hail were "Mist, and Heavy-dew and Light-dew." After the catastrophe

been hidden between [sky and earth] before they were parted, now multiplied upon the earth." 9
This tradition of the Maoris has substantially the same elements as the Israelite tradition. The
destruction of the world was accompanied by hurricanes, hail (meteorites), and sky-high billows;
the land submerged; a mist covered the earth for a long time; heavy dew fell to the ground
together with light dew, as in the passage quoted from Numbers 11 : 9.
The writings of Buddhism relate that when a world cycle comes to an end with the world
destroyed and the ocean dried up, there is no distinction of day and night and heavenly ambrosia
serves as food.10
In the hymns of Rig-Veda,11 it is said that honey (madhu) comes from the clouds. These clouds
originated from the pillar of cloud. Among the hymns of the Atharva-Veda there is one to the
honey-lash: "From heaven, from earth, from the atmosphere, from the sea, from the fire, and
from the wind, the honey-lash hath verily sprung. This, clothed in amrite (ambrosia), all the
creatures revering, acclaim in their hearts." 12
The Egyptian Book of the Dead speaks of "the divine clouds and the great dew" that bring the
earth into contact with the heavens.13
The Greeks called the heavenly bread ambrosia. It is described by the Greek poets in identical
terms with manna: it had the taste of honey and a fragrance. This heavenly bread has given
classical scholars many headaches. Greek authors from Homer and Hesiod down through the
ages continually referred to ambrosia as the heavenly food which in its fluid state is called
nectar.14 But it was used also as ointment15 (it had the fragrance of a lily), and as food for the
horses of Hera when she visited Zeus in the sky.16 Hera (Earth) was

veiled in it when she hurried from her brother Ares (Mars) to Zeus (Jupiter). What could it be,
this heavenly bread, which served also as a veil for a goddess-planet, and was used as an
ointment, too? It was honey, said some scholars. But honey is a regular food for mortals,
whereas ambrosia was given only to the generation of heroes.
"Then what was this substance that served as fodder on the ground for horses, as a veil for
planets, bread from the sky for heroes, and that also turned fluid for their drink, and was oil and
perfume for ointments?
•It was the manna that was baked into bread, had an oily taste and also a honey taste, was found
on the ground by man and beast, wrapped the earth and the heavenly bodies in a veil, was called
"corn of heaven" and "bread of the mighty,"1T had a fragrant odor, and served the women in the
wilderness as ointment.18 Manna, like ambrosia, was compared with honey and with morning
dew.
The belief of Aristotle and other writers19 that honey falls from the atmosphere with the dew
was based on the experience of those days when the world was veiled in the carbon clouds that
precipitated honey-frost.
These clouds are described as "dreaded shades" in the Kalevala. From these "dreaded shades,"
says the epos, honey dropped. "And the clouds their fragrance sifted, sifted honey . . . from their
home within the heavens." 20
The Maoris in the Pacific, the Jews on the border of Asia and Africa, the Hindus, the Finns, the
Icelanders, all describe the honey-food being dropped from the clouds, dreary shades of the
shadow of death, that enveloped the earth after a cosmic catastrophe. All traditions agree also
that the source of the heavenly bread falling from the clouds with the morning dew was a
celestial body. The Sibyl says that the sweet heavenly bread came from the starry heavens.21

honey that dropped from the clouds.22 Athena covered other planet-goddesses with a "robe
ambrosial," and provided nectar and ambrosia to the heroes.23 Other traditions, too, see the
origin of the honey-dew in a celestial body that enveloped the earth in clouds. For this reason
ambrosia or manna is called "heavenly bread."
Rivers of Milk and Honey
•^The honey-frost fell in enormous quantities. The haggadic literature says that the quantity
which fell every day would have sufficed to nourish the people for two thousand years.1 All the
peoples of the East and the West could see it.2
A few hours after the break of day, the heat under the cloud cover liquefied the grains and
volatilized them.3 The ground absorbed some of the liquefied mass, as it absorbs dew. The
grains also fell upon the water, and the rivers became milky in appearance.
The Egyptians relate that the Nile flowed for a time blended with honey.4 The strange
appearance of the rivers of Palestine—in the desert the Israelites saw no river—caused the scouts

who returned from a survey of the land to call it the land that "floweth with milk and honey"
(Numbers 13 : 27). "The heavens rain oil, the wadis run with honey," says a text found in RasShamra (Ugarit) in Syria.5
In the rabbinical literature it is said that "melting of manna formed streams that furnished drink
to many deer and other animals." 6
The Atharva-Veda hymns say that honey-lash came down from fire and wind; ambrosia fell, and
streams of honey flowed upon the earth. "The broad earth shall milk for us precious honey . . .

covered successively by black, red, and white milk. The first and second were the colors of the
substances, ashes and "blood," that constituted the plagues (Exodus 7 and 9); the last one was the
color of ambrosia that turned into nectar on land and water.
A memory of a time when "streams of milk and streams of sweet nectar flowed" is also
preserved in Ovid.8
Jericho
' The earth's crust trembled and cracked again and again as its strata settled after the major
displacement. Chasms opened up, springs disappeared, and new springs appeared.1 When the
Israelites approached the river Jordan, a slice of one bank fell, blocking the stream long enough
for the tribes to cross over. "The waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a
heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the
sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right
against Jericho." 2
A similar occurrence took place on the eighth of December, 1267, when the Jordan was dammed
for sixteen hours, and again following the earthquake of 1927, when a slice of one bank fell into
the river not far from Adam and blocked the water for over twenty-one hours; at Damieh (Adam)
the people crossed the river on its dry bed.3
The fall of the walls of Jericho at the blast of the trumpets is a well-known episode, but it is not
well interpreted. The horns blown by the priests for seven days played no greater natural role
than Moses' rod with which, in the legend, he opened a passage in the sea. "When the people
heard the sound of the trumpet," it happened that

"the wall fell down flat."4 The great sound of the trumpet was produced by the earth; the Israelite

these walls collapsed at the beginning of the Hyksos period, or shortly after the close of the
Middle Kingdom.6 The earth had not yet recovered from the previous world catastrophe, and
reacted with continuous tremors when the hour of a new cosmic disaster approached: the event
we described at the beginning of this book only to go back to the cataclysm of the Exodus—the
upheaval of the days of Joshua, when the earth stood still on the day of the battle at Beth-horon.

CHAPTER 7
Stones Suspended in the Air
THE HOT HAILSTONES which, at Moses' intercession, had remained suspended in the air
when they were about to fall upon the Egyptians, were now cast down upon the Canaanites." 1
These words mean that a part of the meteorites of the cometary train of the days of Exodus
remained in the celestial sphere for about fifty years, falling in the days of Joshua, in the valley
of Beth-horon, on the same forenoon when the sun and the moon stood still for the length of a
full day.
The language of the Talmud and Midrash suggests that the same comet returned after some fifty
years. Once more it passed very close to the earth. This time it did not reverse the poles of the
earth, but kept the terrestrial axis tilted for a considerable length of time. Again the world was, in
the language of the rabbis, "consumed in the whirlwind," "and all the kingdoms tottered," "the
earth quaked and trembled from the noise of thunder"; terrified mankind was decimated once
more, and carcasses were like rubbish in this Day of Anger.2
On the day when this took place on the earth, the sky was in confusion. Stones fell from the
heavens, sun and moon stopped in their paths, and a comet must also have been seen. Habakkuk
describes the portent in the sky on that memorable day when, in his words, "the sun and moon
stood still in their habitation": it had the form of a man on a chariot drawn by horses and was
regarded as God's angel.

'His glory covered the heavens . . . and his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out

everlasting mountains were scattered. . . . Was thine anger against the rivers? Was thy wrath

didst cleave the earth with rivers. The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of

With the earth disturbed in its spinning on its axis, the mechanical friction of displaced strata and
magma must have set the world on fire.
The world burned. The Greek story of Phaethon will be introduced here because of the
interpretation heard by Solon during his visit to Egypt.
Phaethon
The Greeks as well as the Carians and other peoples on the shores of the Aegean Sea told of a
time when the sun was driven off its course and disappeared for an entire day, and the earth was
burned and drowned.
The Greek legend says that the young Phaethon, who claimed parentage of the sun, on that fatal
day tried to drive the chariot of the sun. Phaethon was unable to make his way "against the
whirling poles," and "their swift axis" swept him away. Phaethon in Greek means "the blazing
one."
Many authors have dealt with the story of Phaethon; the best known version is a creation of the
Latin poet Ovid. The chariot of the sun, driven by Phaethon, moved "no longer in the same
course as before." The horses "break loose from their course" and "rush aimlessly, knocking
against the stars set deep in the sky and snatching the chariot along through uncharted ways."
The constellations of the cold Bears tried to plunge into the forbidden sea, and the sun's chariot
roamed through unknown regions of the air. It was "borne along just as a ship driven before the
headlong blast, whose pilot has let the useless rudder go and abandoned the ship to the gods and
prayers." 1
"The earth bursts into flame, the highest parts first, and splits into deep cracks, and its moisture is
all dried up. The meadows are burned to white ashes; the trees are consumed, green leaves and
all, and the ripe grain furnishes fuel for its own destruction. . . . Great cities perish with their
walls, and the vast conflagration reduces whole nations to ashes."
"The woods are ablaze with the mountains. . . . Aetna is blazing

boundlessly . . . and twin-peaked Parnassus. . . . Nor does its chilling clime save Scythia;
Caucasus burns . . . and the heaven-piercing Alps and cloud-capped Apennines."
The scorched clouds belched forth smoke. Phaethon sees the earth aflame. "He can no longer
bear the ashes and whirling sparks, and is completely shrouded in the dense, hot smoke. In this
pitchy darkness he cannot tell where he is or whither he is going."
"It was then, as men think, that the peoples of Aethiopia became black-skinned, since the blood
was drawn to the surface of their bodies by the heat."

How could the poets have known that a change in the movement of the sun across the firmament
must cause a world conflagration, blazing of volcanoes, boiling of rivers, disappearance of seas,
birth of deserts, emergence of islands, if the sun never changed its harmonious journey from
sunrise to sunset?
The disturbance in the movement of the sun was followed by a period as long as a day, when the
sun did not appear at all. Ovid continues: "If we are to believe report, one whole day went
without the sun.2 But the burning world gave light."
A prolonged night in one part of the world must be accompanied by a prolonged day in another
part; in Ovid we see the phenomenon related in the Book of Joshua, but from another longitude.
This may 2 "Si modo credimus. irnum isse diem sine sole ferunt."

stimulate surmise as to the geographical origin of the Indo-Iranian or Carian migrants to Greece.
The globe changed the inclination of its axis; latitudes changed, too. Ovid ends the description of
the world catastrophe contained in the story of Phaethon: "Causing all things to shake with her
mighty trembling, she [the earth] sank back a little lower than her wonted place."
Plato recorded the story heard two generations before from Solon, the wise ruler of Athens.3
Solon, on his visit to Egypt, questioned the priests, versed in the lore of antiquity, on early
history. He discovered that "neither he himself nor any other Greek knew any thing at all, one
might say, about such matters." Solon unfolded before tha priests the tale of the deluge, the only
ancient tradition he was aware of. One of the priests, an old man,4 said:
"There have been and there will be many and divers destructions of mankind, of which the
greatest are by fire and water, and lesser ones by countless other means. For in truth the story
that is told in your country as well as ours, how once upon a time Phaethon, son of Helios, yoked
his father's chariot, and, because he was unable to drive it along the course taken by his father,
burnt up all that was upon the earth and himself perished by a thunderbolt—that story, as it is
told, has the fashion of a legend, but the truth of it lies in the occurrence of a shifting of the
bodies in the heavens which move around the earth, and a destruction of the things on the earth
by fierce fire, which recurs at long intervals." 6
The Egyptian priest explained to Solon that in these catastrophes the literary works of many
peoples and their learned men perished; for that reason the Greeks were still childish, as they no
longer knew the true horrors of the past.
These words of the priest were only an introduction to a revelation of his knowledge about lands
that were erased when Greece also and

the entire world were visited with heavenly wrath. He told the story of a mighty kingdom on a
great island in the middle of the Atiantic Ocean that submerged and sank forever into its waters.
Atlantis
The story narrated by Plato of the island of Atlantis that ruled Africa as far as the border of
Egypt and Europe as far as Tuscany on the Apennine peninsula and that in one fatal night was
shattered by earthquakes and sank, never ceased to occupy the imagination of the literati. Strabo
and Pliny thought that the story of Atlantis was an illusion of the elderly Plato. But to this day

robin-bobin

the tradition, as revived by Plato, has not died. Poets and novelists have exploited the story
freely; scientists have done so with caution. An incomplete catalogue of the literature on Atlantis
in 1926 included 1,700 titles.1 Although Plato said clearly that Atlantis was situated behind the
Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar), in the Atlantic Ocean, as is also indicated by the name of the
island, travelers and other guessers have placed Atlantis in all parts of the world, even on dry
land, as, for example, in Tunisia,2 Palestine,3 and South America. Ceylon, Newfoundland, and
Spitzbergen have also been considered. This was due to the fact that traditions of inundations
and submersion of islands exist in all parts of the world.
Plato set down what Solon had heard in Egypt from the learned priest. "The [Atlantic] ocean
there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the
Pillars of Heracles' [Hercules], there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia [Asia
Minor] together; and it was possible for the travellers of that time to cross from it to the other
islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses
that veritable ocean. . . . Yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be
called, in the fullest and

truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, a
great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands
also and parts of the continent; and, moreover, of the lands here within the Straits they ruled over
Libya as far as Egypt, and over Europe as far as Tuscany." 4
In the nineteenth century ships sailed the Atlantic Ocean to explore its bed in search of Atlantis,
and before the Second World War scientific societies existed for the sole purpose of exploring
the problem of the sunken island.
Much speculation was offered, not only on the whereabouts of Atlantis, but also on the cultural
achievements of its inhabitants. Plato, in another work of his (Critias), wrote a political treatise,
and, as no real place in the world could have been the scene of his utopia, he chose for that
purpose the sunken island. Modern scholars, finding some affinity between American, Egyptian,
and Phoenician cultures, think that Atlantis may have been the intermediary link. There is much
probability in these speculations; if they are justified, Crete, a maritime base of Carian
navigators, may disclose some information about Atlantis as soon as the Cretan scripts are
satisfactorily deciphered.
One point in Plato's story about the submersion of Atlantis requires correction. Plato said that
Solon told the story to Critias the elder, and that the young Critias, Plato's friend, heard it from
his grandfather when he was a ten-year-old boy. Critias the younger remembered having been
told that the catastrophe which befell Atlantis happened 9,000 years before. There is one zero too
many here. We do not know of any vestiges of human culture, aside from that of the Neolithic
age, nor of any navigating nation, 9,000 years before Solon. Numbers we hear in childhood
easily grow in our memory, as do dimensions. When revisiting our childhood home, we are
surprised at the smallness of the rooms—we had remembered them as much larger. Whatever the
source of the error, the most probable date of the sinking of Atlantis would be in the middle of
the second millennium, 900 years before Solon, when the earth twice suffered great
* Plato Timaeus 24 E-25 B.
148
WORLDS IN COLLISION
catastrophes as a result of "the shifting of the heavenly bodies." These words of Plato received
the least attention, though they deserved the greatest.
The destruction of Atlantis is described by Plato as he heard it from his source: "At a later time
there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day and night befell them,
when the whole body of your [Greek] warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of
Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at

robin-bobin

that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud
which the island created as it settled down." 5
At the time when Atlantis perished in the ocean, the people of Greece were destroyed: the
catastrophe was ubiquitous.
As if recalling what had happened, the Psalmist wrote: "Destructions are come to a perpetual
end: and thou hast destroyed cities, their memorial is perished with them." 6 He prayed also:
"God is our refuge and strength . . . therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be
troubled." T
The Floods of Deucalion and Ogyges
The history of Greece knows two great natural catastrophes: the floods of Deucalion and of
Ogyges. One of them, usually that of Deucalion, is described by Greek authors as having been
simultaneous with the conflagration of Phaethon. The floods of Deucalion and Ogyges brought
overwhelming destruction to the mainland of Greece and to the islands around and caused
changes in the geographical profile of the area. That of Deucalion was most devastating: water
covered the land and annihilated the population. According to the legend, only two persons—
Deucalion and his wife—remained alive. This last detail must not be taken more literally than
similar statements found in descriptions of great catastrophes all around the world; for example,
two daughters of Lot, who hid with him in a cave

« Psalms 9:6.
» Psalms 46 : 1-3.

149
after the catastrophe of Sodom and Gomorrah, believed that they and their father were the only
survivors in the land.1 ^*"
The chronologists among the Fathers of the Church found material for assuming that one of the
two catastrophes, the flood of Deucalion or that of Ogyges, had been contemporaneous with the
Exodus.
Julius Africanus wrote: "We affirm that Ogygus [Ogyges] from whom the first flood [in Attica]
derived its name, and who was saved when many perished, lived at the time of the Exodus of the
people from Egypt along with Moses." 2 He further expressed his belief in the coincidence of the
catastrophe of Ogyges and the one that occurred in Egypt in the days of the Exodus in the
following words: J^"The Passover and the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt took place, and
also in Attica the flood of Ogygus. And that is according to reason. For when the Egyptians were
being smitten in the anger of God with hail and storms, it was only to be expected that certain
parts of the earth should suffer with them." s
^Eusebius placed the Flood of Deucalion and the conflagration of Phaethon in the fifty-second
year of Moses' life.4 Augustine also synchronized the Flood of Deucalion with the time of
Moses; 5 he assumed that the Flood of Ogyges took place earlier. .-^ A chronologist of the
seventh century (Isidore, bishop of Seville) * dated the Flood of Deucalion in the time of Moses;
chronologists of the seventeenth century likewise calculated that the Flood of Deucalion took
place in the time of Moses, close to but not simultaneous with the Exodus.7
It would seem to be more probable that, if the catastrophes oc1 Genesis 19 : 31.

curred one shortly after the other, the catastrophe of Ogyges took place after that of Deucalion
which practically destroyed the land, depopulated it, and erased every memory of what had
happened up to that time. In the words of Plato, who quoted the Egyptian priest speaking to
Solon, the catastrophes must have escaped the notice of the future generations because, as a
result of the devastation, "for many generations the survivors died with no power to express
themselves in writing." The memory of the catastrophe of Ogyges would have vanished in the
catastrophe of Deucalion if Ogyges had preceded Deucalion.8
Apparently, the truth is with those who placed the catastrophe of Deucalion in the days of
Exodus; but those who reckoned that Ogyges was a contemporary of Moses were also correct,
except that Moses did not live until the Flood of Ogyges—it took place in the days of Joshua.
In commemoration of the Deucalion flood, the people of Athens observed a feast in the month of
Anthesterion, which is a spring month; the feast was called Anthesteria. On the thirteenth of the
month, the main day of the feast, honey and flour were poured into a fissure in the earth as a
sacrifice.9
The date of this ceremony—the thirteenth day of Anthesterion in the spring—is revealing if we
remember what was said in the section entitled "13." It was on the thirteenth day of the spring
month (Aviv) that the great planetary contact occurred which preceded by a few hours the
Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt.
The offering of honey and flour as the main ceremony of the feast is also revealing if we
recollect that manna, or heavenly corn, tasting like honey, fell on the earth after the contact of
the earth with a celestial body.
As to the provenance of the name Deucalion, scholars admit that

it is not known.10 For the name and the person of Ogyges we have some concrete information.
Although Ogyges was a king, the Greek annalists who wrote of the "flood of Ogyges" as one of
the outstanding events of the past of their country, at the same time did not know anything about
a king of that name in Greece.11 Who was Ogyges?
> We can solve this problem. When the Israelites under Moses approached the border of Moab,
Balaam in his blessing of Israel used these words: "His king shall be higher than Agag [Agog]."
12 Agog must have been the most important king of that time in the area around the eastern
Mediterranean.
In my reconstruction of ancient history, I shall put forward proofs that the Amalekite king, Agog
I, was identical with the Hyksos king whose name the Egyptologists tentatively read Apop I, and
who, a few decades after the invasion of Egypt by the Amu (Hyksos), laid the foundation of
Thebes, the future capital of the New Kingdom in Egypt.
In conformity with this assertion, I can point to the fact that Greek tradition, which does not
know of any activities of King Ogyges in Attica, occasionally places the domicile of Ogyges in
Egyptian Thebes, and Aeschylus calls Thebes of Egypt "the Ogygian Thebes," to differentiate it
from the Greek Thebes in Boeotia. Ogyges is also credited with founding Thebes in Egypt.13
¦^Agog was a contemporary of the aging Moses; he was a ruler who, in his time, had no equal in
the region bordering the eastern Medi10 "While the meaning of the legend is clear, the meaning of the name Deucalion is enigmatic."

Deucalion was a son of Prometheus.

terranean;14 the catastrophe in the time of Joshua, successor to Moses, was called by his, Agog's,
name.
The assertion of Solinus, the author of Polyhistor, that the flood of Ogyges was followed by a
night of nine months' duration does not necessarily signify a confusion with the darkness that
ensued after the cataclysm of the Exodus; as the causes were similar, similar results must have
followed. The eruption of thousands of volcanoes would suffice to produce this darkness, of a
shorter duration than that which followed the cataclysm of the Exodus.15
Thus, the Greek traditions of the floods of Ogyges and Deucalion contain elements which,
though interchanged, can be traced to two great upheavals in the middle of the second
millennium before the present era.16
14 The rabbinical sources say that Amalek went to conquer "the entire world." Seals of the
Hyksos kings were found on Crete, in Palestine, in Mesopotamia, and in other places outside
Egypt.

Deluge (of Noah).
CHAPTER 8
The Fifty-two Year Period
THE WORKS of Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, the early Mexican scholar (circa 1568-1648)
who was able to read old Mexican texts, preserve the ancient tradition according to which the
multiple of fifty-two-year periods played an important role in the recurrence of world
catastrophes.1 He asserts also that only fifty-two years elapsed between two great catastrophes,
each of which terminated a world age.
s I have already pointed out, the Israelite tradition counts forty years of wandering in the desert;
between the time when the Israelites left the desert and started the difficult task of the conquest,
and the time of the battle at Beth-horon twelve years may well have passed. The conquest of
Canaan took fourteen years, and the entire duration of Joshua's leadership amounted to twentyeight years.2 ¦ -Now there exists a remarkable fact: the natives of pre-Columbian Mexico
expected a new catastrophe at the end of every period of

changing number of years as an addition to these figures. A. Hum-boldt (Researches, II, 28)
contraposed the lengths of the world ages in the Vatican manuscript (No. 3738) and their lengths
in the system of the tradition preserved by Ixtlilxochid.
Four ages of 105 years are referred to by Censorinus (Liber de die natali) as having taken place,
according to the belief of the Etruscans, between world catastrophes presaged by celestial
portents.

fifty-two years and congregated to await the event. "When the night of this ceremony arrived, all
the people were seized with fear and waited in anxiety for what might take place." They were
afraid that "it will be the end of the human race and that the darkness of the night may become
permanent: the sun may not rise anymore."3 They watched for the appearance of the planet
Venus, and when, on the feared day, no catastrophe occurred, the people of Maya rejoiced. They
brought human sacrifices and offered the hearts of prisoners whose chests they opened with
knives of flint. On that night, when the fifty-two-year period ended, a great bonfire announced to
the fearful crowds that a new period of grace had been granted and a new Venus cycle started.4
"•'The period of fifty-two years, regarded by the ancient Mexicans as the interval between two
world catastrophes, was definitely related by them to the planet Venus; and this period of Venus
was observed by both the Mayas and the Aztecs.5
The old Mexican custom of sacrificing to the Morning Star survived in human sacrifices by the
Skidi Pawnee of Nebraska in years when the Morning Star "appeared especially bright, or in
years when there was a comet in the sky."8
What had Venus to do with the catastrophes that brought the world to the brink of destruction?
Here is a question that will carry us very far, indeed.
Jubilee
I shall postpone only a little giving the answer to the question just posed. First, I should like to
find an explanation for the institution of the jubilee year of the Israelites.
,.->Every seventh year, according to the law, was a sabbatical year during which the land had to
be left fallow and Jewish slaves set free. The fiftieth year was a jubilee year, when the land not
only had

155
to be left fallow, but had to be returned to its original proprietors. According to the law, one
could not convey his land for ever; the deed of sale was but a lease for whatever number of years
remained until the jubilee year. The year was proclaimed by the blowing of horns on the Day of
Atonement. "In the Day of Atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the
inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you, and ye shall return every man unto his
possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family." 1
Ever since, exegetes have labored over the biblical statement that the jubilee year was to be
observed every fiftieth year. The seventh sabbatical year is the forty-ninth year: "And the space
of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. . . . And ye shall hallow the
fiftieth year." 2 To leave the land fallow for two consecutive years was too great a demand and
cannot be explained by the need of the soil under cultivation for rest. The festival of the jubilee,
with the return of land to its original owners and the release of slaves, bears the character of an
atonement, and its proclamation on the Day of Atonement emphasizes this still further. Was
there any special reason why fear returned every fifty years? The jubilee of the Mayas must have
had a genesis similar to that of the jubilee of the Israelites. The difference lies in the human
character of the festival of the Jews and its inhuman character among the Mayas; but with both
peoples it was a year of atonement, repeating itself every fiftieth year in the one case and every
fifty-second year in the other.
Comets do not return at exact periods because of perturbations caused by larger planets.3 The
Mayas expected the return of a catastrophe every fifty-second year because that was the interval
between two cataclysms that had taken place. It may be that the comet was actually seen again at
such intervals. The Jews fasted and prepared

themselves for the Day of Judgment on the earliest possible date of its return; the Mayas had
their festival when the dreaded time had passed without harm.
. On the Day of Atonement the Israelites used to send a scapegoat to "Azazel" in the desert.4 It
was a ceremony of propitiation of Satan. In Egypt tne goat was an animal dedicated to SethTyphon.5 Azazel was a fallen star or Lucifer. It was also called Azzael, Azza, or Uzza.8
According to the rabbinical legend, Uzza was the star angel of Egypt: it was thrown into the Red
Sea when the Israelites made their passage.7 The Arab name of the planet Venus is al-Uzza.8
Arabs used to bring human sacrifices to al-Uzza; Mohammed, too, in his early days, worshiped
it, and even today the Arabs seek its help.9
On the day on which the jubilee year was proclaimed, the Israelites dispatched a placating
offering of a scapegoat to Lucifer. But what had Venus to do with the jubilee and the atonement?
The Birth of Venus
A planet turns and revolves on a quite circular orbit around a greater body, the sun; it makes
contact with another body, a comet, that travels on a stretched out ellipse. The planet slips from
its axis, runs in disorder off its orbit, wanders rather erratically, and in the end is freed from the
embrace of the comet.
The body on the long ellipse experiences similar disturbances. Drawn off its path, it glides to
some new orbit; its long train of gaseous substances and stones is torn away by the sun or by the
planet, or runs away and revolves as a smaller comet along its own
?Leviticus 16 : 8-26. The priests used to cast lots for two goats: one goat for the Lord and the
other as the scapegoat for Azazel.

Ancient Mexican records give the order of the occurrences. The sun was attacked by Quetzalcohuatl; after the disappearance of this serpent-shaped heavenly body, the sun refused to shine,
and during four days the world was deprived of its light; a great many people died at that time.
Thereafter, the snakelike body transformed itself into a great star. The star retained the name of
Quetzal-cohuatl [Quetzal-coatl]. This great and brilliant star appeared for the first time in the
east.1 Quetzal-cohuatl is the well-known name of the planet Venus.2
Thus we read that "the sun refused to show itself and during four days the world was deprived of
light. Then a great star . . . appeared; it was given the name Quetzal-cohuatl . . . the sky, to show
its anger . . . caused to perish a great number of people who died of famine and pestilence." 3
The sequence of seasons and the duration of days and nights became disarranged. "It was then . .
. that the people [of Mexico] regulated anew the reckoning of days, nights, and hours, according
to the difference in time." 4
"It is a remarkable thing, moreover, that time is measured from the moment of its [Morning
Star's] appearance. . . . Tlahuizcal-panteuctli or the Morning Star appeared for the first time
following the convulsions of the earth overwhelmed by a deluge." It looked like a monstrous
serpent. "This serpent is adorned with feathers: that is why it is called Quetzal-cohuatl,
Gukumatz or Kukulcan. Just as the world is about to emerge from the chaos of the great

robin-bobin

catastrophe, it is seen to appear." 5 The feather arrangement of Quetzal-cohuatl "represented
flames of fire." 6
Again, the old texts speak "of the change that took place, at the moment of the great catastrophe

v. The cataclysm, accompanied by a prolonged darkness, appears to have been that of the days of
the Exodus, when a tempest of cinders darkened the world disturbed in its rotation. Some of the
references may allude to the subsequent catastrophe of the time of the conquest by Joshua, when
the sun remained for more than a day in the sky of the old world. Since it was the same comet
that on both occasions made contact with the earth, and at each of the contacts the comet
changed its own orbit, the relevant question is not, "On which occasion did the comet change its
orbit?" but first of all, "Which comet changed to a planet?" or "Which planet was a comet in
historical times?" The transformation of the comet into a planet began on contact with the earth
in the middle of the second millennium before the present era and was carried a step further one
jubilee period later. "After the dramatic events of the time of Exodus, the earth was shrouded in
dense clouds for decades, and observation of stars was not possible; after the second contact,
Venus, the new and splendid member of the solar family, was seen moving along its orbit. It was
in the days of Joshua, a time designation meaningful to the reader of the sixth book of the
Scriptures; but for the ancients it was "the time of Agog." As I explained above, he was the king
by whose name the cataclysm (the Deluge of Ogyges) was known, and who, according to Greek
tradition, laid the foundations of Thebes in Egypt.
In The City of God by Augustine it is written:
"From the book of Marcus Varro, entitled Of the Race of the Roman People, I cite word for word
the following instance: 'There occurred a remarkable celestial portent; for Castor records that in
the brilliant star Venus, called Vesperugo by Plautus, and the lovely Hesperus by Homer, there
occurred so strange a prodigy, that it changed its color, size, form, course, which never happened
before nor since. Adrastus of Cyzicus, and Dion of Naples, famous mathematicians, said that this
occurred in the reign of Ogyges.'" 8

The Fathers of the Church considered Ogyges a contemporary of Moses. Agog, mentioned in the
blessing of Balaam, was the king Ogyges. The upheaval that took place in the days of Joshua and
Agog, the deluge that occurred in the days of Ogyges, the metamorphosis of Venus in the days of
Ogyges, the star Venus which appeared in the sky of Mexico after a protracted night and a great
catastrophe—all these occurrences are related.
Augustine went on to make a curious comment on the transformation of Venus: "Certainly that
phenomenon disturbed the canons of the astronomers ... so as to take upon them to affirm that
this which happened to the Morning Star (Venus) never happened before nor since. But we read
in the divine books that even the sun itself stood still when a holy man, Joshua the son of Nun,
had begged this from God."
Augustine had no inkling that Castor, as quoted by Varro, and the Book of Jasher, as quoted in
the Book of Joshua, refer to the same occurrence.
Are Hebrew sources silent on the birth of a new star in the days of Joshua? They are not. It is
written in a Samaritan chronicle that during the invasion of Palestine by the Israelites under

robin-bobin

Joshua, a new star was born in the east: "A star arose out of the east against which all magic is
vain." 9
Chinese chronicles record that "a brilliant star appeared in the days of Yahu [Yahou]."10
The Blazing Star
Plato, citing the Egyptian priest, said that the world conflagration associated with Phaethon was
caused by a shifting of bodies in the sky which move around the earth. As we have reason to
assume that it was the comet Venus that, after two contacts with the earth, eventually became a
planet, we shall do well to inquire: Did Phaethon turn into the Morning Star?

Star. The earliest writer who refers to the transformation of Phaethon into a planet is Hesiod.2
This transformation is related by Hyginus in his Astronomy, where he tells how Phaethon, that
caused the conflagration of the world, was struck by a thunderbolt of Jupiter and was placed by
the sun among the stars (planets) .3 It was the general belief that Phaethon changed into the
Morning Star.4
On the island of Crete, Atymnios was the name of the unlucky driver of the sun's chariot; he was
worshiped as the Evening Star, which is the same as the Morning Star.5
The birth of the Morning Star, or the transformation of a legendary person (Istehar, Phaethon,
Quetzal-cohuatl) into the Morning Star was a widespread motif in the folklore of the oriental6
and occidental 7 peoples. The Tahitian tradition of the birth of the Morning Star is narrated on
the Society Island in the Pacific;8 the Mangaian legend says that with the birth of a new star, the
earth was battered by countless fragments.9 The Buriats, Kirghiz, and Yakuts of Siberia, and the
Eskimos of North America also tell of the birth of the planet Venus.10
A blazing star disrupted the visible movement of the sun, caused a world conflagration, and
became the Morning-Evening Star. This may be found not only in the legends and traditions, but
also in astronomical books of the ancient peoples of both hemispheres.

four planets could have been seen, and that in astronomical charts of this early period the planet
Venus cannot be found.
In an ancient Hindu table of planets, attributed to the year —3102, Venus alone among the
visible planets is absent.1 The Brahmans of the early period did not know the five-planet
system,2 and only in a later ("middle") period did the Brahmans speak of five planets.
Babylonian astronomy, too, had a four-planet system. In ancient prayers the planets Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury are invoked; the planet Venus is missing; and one speaks of "the
four-planet system of the ancient astronomers of Babylonia." 3 These four-planet systems and
the inability of the ancient Hindus and Babylonians to see Venus in the sky, even though it is
more conspicuous than the other planets, are puzzling unless Venus was not among the planets.

On a later date "the planet Venus receives the appellative: The great star that joins the great
stars.' The great stars are, of course, the four planets Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn . . . and
Venus joins them as the fifth planet." 4
Apollonius Bhodius refers to a time "when not all the orbs were yet in the heavens." 5
One of the Planets Is a Comet
Democritus (circa —460 to circa —370), a contemporary of Plato and one of the great scholars
of antiquity, is accused by the moderns of not having understood the planetary character of
Venus.1 Plutarch
1 J. B. J. Delambre, Histoire de Vastronomie ancienne (1817), I, 407: "Venus alone is not found
there."
2 "It is often denied that the Veda-Hindus knew of the existence of the five planets." "The
striking fact that the Brahmans . . . never mention five planets." G. Thibaut, "Astronomie,
Astrologie und Mathematik" in Grundriss der indo-arischen Philol. und Altertumskunde, III
(1899).
3 E. F. Weidner, Handbuch der babylonischen Astronomie (1915), p. 61, writes of a star list
found in Boghaz Keui in Asia Minor: "That the planet Venus is missing will not startle anybody
who knows the eminent importance of the four-planet system in the Babylonian astronomy."
Weidner supposes that Venus is missing in the list of planets because "she belongs to a triad with
the moon and the sun." On Ishtar in early inscriptions cf. infra, p. 175.

5 Apollonius Rhodius, The Argonautica, Bk. iv, 11. 257 ff.
1 "Democritus [says] that the fixed stars are in the highest place; after those the
planets; after which the sun, Venus, and the moon, in their order." Plutarch,
162
WORLDS IN COLLISION
quotes him as speaking of Venus as if it were not one of the planets. But apparently the author of
the treatises on geometry, optics, and astronomy, no longer extant, knew more about Venus than
his critics think. From quotations which have survived in other authors, we know that
Democritus built a theory of the creation and destruction of worlds which sounds like the modern
planetesimal theory without its shortcomings. He wrote: "The worlds are unequally distributed in
space; here there are more, there fewer; some are waxing, some are in their prime, some waning:
coming into being in one part of the universe, ceasing in another part. The cause of their
perishing is collision with one another." 2 He knew that "the planets are at unequal distances
from us" and that there are more planets than we are able to discover with our eyes.3 Aristotle
quoted the opinion of Democritus: "Stars have been seen when comets dissolve."4
Among the early Greek scholars, Pythagoras of the sixth century is generally credited with
having had access to some secret science. His pupils, and their pupils, the so-called
Pythagoreans, were cautious not to disclose their science to anyone who did not belong to their
circle. Aristotle wrote of their interpretation of the nature of comets: "Some of the Italians called
Pythagoreans say that the comet is one of the planets, but that it appears at great intervals of time
and only rises a little above the horizon. This is the case with Mercury too; because it only rises a
little above the horizon it often fails to be seen and consequently appears at great intervals of
time." 5
This is a confused presentation of a theory; but it is possible to trace the truth in the Pythagorean
teaching, which was not understood by Aristotle. A comet is a planet which returns at long
intervals. One of the planets, which rises only a little above the horizon, was still regarded by the
Pythagoreans of the fourth century as a comet. With the knowledge obtained from other sources,
it is easy

to guess that by "one of the planets" is meant Venus; only Mercury and Venus rise a little above
the horizon.
Aristotle disagreed with the Pythagorean scholars who considered one of the five planets to be a
comet.
"These views involve impossibilities. . . . This is the case, first, with those who say that the
comet is one of the planets . . . more comets than one have often appeared simultaneously ... as a
matter of fact, no planet has been observed besides the five. And all of them are often visible
above the horizon together at the same time. Further, comets are often found to appear, as well
when all the planets are visible as when some are not."6
With these words, Aristotle, who did not learn the secrets of the Pythagoreans directly, tried to
refute their teaching by arguing that all five planets are in their places when a comet appears, as
if the Pythagoreans thought that all comets were one and the same planet leaving its usual path at
certain times. But the Pythagoreans did not think that one planet represents all comets.
According to Plutarch,7 they taught that each of the comets has its own orbit and period of
revolution. Hence the Pythagoreans apparently knew that the comet which is "one of the planets"
is Venus.
The Comet Venus
During the centuries when Venus was a comet, it had a tail.
The early traditions of the peoples of Mexico, written down in pre-Columbian days, relate that
Venus smoked. "The star that smoked, la estrella que humeava, was Sitlae choloha, which the
Spaniards call Venus."1
"Now, I ask," says Alexander Humboldt, "what optical illusion could give Venus the appearance
of a star throwing out smoke?"2
Sahagun, the sixteenth century Spanish authority on Mexico, wrote
«Ibid.

that the Mexicans called a comet "a star that smoked." 3 It may thus be concluded that since the
Mexicans called Venus "a star that smoked," they considered it a comet.
It is also said in the Vedas that the star Venus looks like fire with smoke.4 Apparently, the star
had a tail, dark in the daytime and luminous at night. In very concrete form this luminous tail,
which Venus had in earlier centuries, is mentioned in the Talmud, in the Tractate Shabbat: "Fire
is hanging down from the planet Venus." 5
This phenomenon was described by the Chaldeans. The planet Venus "was said to have a beard."
6 This same technical expression ("beard") is used in modern astronomy in the description of
comets.
These parallels in observations made in the valley of the Ganges, on the shores of the Euphrates,
and on the coast of the Mexican Gulf prove their objectivity. The question must then be put, not
in the form, What was the illusion of the ancient Toltecs and Mayas? but, What was the
phenomenon and what was its cause? A train, large enough to be visible from the earth and
giving the impression of smoke and fire, hung from the planet Venus.
Venus, with its glowing train, was a very brilliant body; it is therefore not strange that the
Chaldeans described it as a "bright torch of heaven," 7 also as a "diamond that illuminates like
the sun," and compared its light with the light of the rising sun.8 At present, the light of Venus is
less than one millionth of the light of the sun. "A stupendous prodigy in the sky," the Chaldeans
called it.9 vThe Hebrews similarly described the planet: "The brilliant light of

Venus blazes from one end of the cosmos to the other end."10
The Chinese astronomical text from Soochow refers to the past when "Venus was visible in full
daylight and, while moving across the sky, rivaled the sun in brightness." J1
.-As late as the seventh century, Assurbanipal wrote about Venus (Ishtar) "who is clothed with
fire and bears aloft a crown of awful splendor."12 The Egyptians under Seti thus described
Venus (Sekh-met): "A circling star which scatters its flame in fire ... a flame of fire in her
tempest." 13
Possessing a tail and moving on a not yet circular orbit, Venus was more of a comet than a
planet, and was called a "smoking star" or a comet by the Mexicans. They also called it by the
name of Tzonte-mocque, or "the mane." 14 The Arabs called Ishtar (Venus) by the name Zebbaj
or "one with hair," as did the Babylonians.15
"Sometimes there are hairs attached to the planets," wrote Pliny;1S an old description of Venus
must have served as a basis for his assertion. But hair or coma is a characteristic of comets, and
in fact "comet" is derived from the Greek word for "hair." The Peruvian name "Chaska" (wavyhaired) 17 is still the name for Venus, though at present the Morning Star is definitely a planet
and has no tail attached to it.
The coma of Venus changed its form with the position of the planet. When the planet Venus
approaches the earth now, it is only partly illuminated, a portion of the disc being in shadow; it
has phases like the moon. At this time, being closer to the earth, it is most brilliant.

When Venus had a coma, the horns of its crescent must have been extended by the illuminated
portions of the coma. It thus had two long appendages and looked like a bull's head.
%. Sanchoniathon says that Astarte (Venus) had a bull's head.18 The planet was even called
Ashteroth-Karnaim, or Astarte of the Horns, a name given to a city in Canaan in honor of this
deity.19 The golden calf worshiped by Aaron and the people at the foot of Sinai was the image
of the star. Rabbinical authorities say that "the devotion of Israel to this worship of the bull is in
part explained by the circumstance that, while passing through the Red Sea, they beheld the
celestial Throne, and most distinctly of the four creatures about the Throne, they saw the ox."20
The likeness of a calf was placed by Jeroboam in Dan, the great temple of the Northern
Kingdom.21

of a bull sprang up also in Mycenaean Greece. A golden cow head with a star on its brow was
found in Mycenae, on the Greek mainland.24
The people of faraway Samoa, primitive tribes that depend on oral tradition as they have no art

Examples and references could be multiplied ad libitum.

one of the two horns became more prominent. Because the astronomical works of antiquity have
so much to say about the horns of Venus, modern scholars have asked them18 Cf. L. Thorndike, A History of Magic and Experimental Science (1923-1941), I, Chap. X.

selves whether the Babylonians could have seen the phases of Venus, which cannot now be
distinguished with the naked eye; 26 Galileo saw them for the first time in modern history when
he used his telescope.
The long horns of Venus could have been seen without the aid of a telescopic lens. The horns
were the illuminated portions of the coma of Venus, which stretched toward the earth. These
horns could also have extended toward the sun as Venus approached the solar orb, since comets
were repeatedly observed with projections in the direction of the sun, while the tails of the
comets are regularly directed away from the sun.
When Venus approached close to one of the planets, its horns grew longer: this is the
phenomenon the astrologers of Babylon observed and described when Venus neared Mars.27
26 "It is well known that not a few passages in the cuneiform texts on astrology speak of the
right or the left horn of Venus. It was deduced that the phases of Venus were observed already
by the Babylonians and that Galileo, in the sixteenth century, was not the first to see them."

CHAPTER 9
Pallas Athene
IN EVERY COUNTRY of the ancient world we can trace cosmo-logical myths of the birth of
the planet Venus. If we look for the god or goddess who represents the planet Venus, we must
inquire which among the gods or goddesses did not exist from the beginning, but was born into
the family. The mythologies of all peoples concern themselves with the birth only of Venus, not
with that of Jupiter, Mars, or Saturn. Jupiter is described as heir to Saturn, but his birth is not a
mythological subject. Horus of the Egyptians and Vishnu, born of Shiva, of the Hindus, were
such newborn deities. Horus battled in the sky with the monster-serpent Seth; so did Vishnu. In
Greece the goddess who suddenly appeared in the sky was Pallas Athene. She sprang from the
head of Zeus-Jupiter. In another legend she was the daughter of a monster, Pallas-Typhon, who
attacked her and whom she battled and killed.
The slaying of the monster by a planet-god is the way in which the peoples perceived the
convulsion of the pillar of smoke when the earth and the comet Venus disturbed each other in
their orbits, and the head of the comet and its tail leaped against each other in violent electrical
discharges.

robin-bobin

The birth of the planet Athene is sung in the Homeric hymn dedicated to her, "the glorious
goddess, virgin, Tritogeneia." When she was born, the vault of the sky—the great Olympus—
"began to reel horribly," "earth round about cried fearfully," "the sea was moved and tossed with
dark waves, while foam burst forth suddenly," and
168
WORLDS IN COLLISION
169
the sun stopped for "a long while." x The Greek text speaks of "purple waves"2 and of "the sea
[that] rises up like a wall," and the sun stopping in its course.3
Aristocles said that Zeus hid the unborn Athene in a cloud and then split it open with lightning,4
which is the mythological way to describe the appearance of a celestial body from the pillar of
cloud.
Athene, or Latin Minerva, is called Tritogeneia (or Tritonia) after the lake Triton.5 This lake
disappeared in a catastrophe in Africa when it broke into the ocean, leaving the desert of Sahara
behind it, a catastrophe connected with the birth of Athene.
Diodorus,6 referring to undisclosed older authorities, says that Lake Triton in Africa
"disappeared from sight in the course of an earthquake, when those parts of it which lay toward
the ocean were torn asunder." This account implies that a great lake or marsh in Africa, separated
from the Atlantic Ocean by a mountainous barrier, disappeared when the barrier was broken or
lowered in a catastrophe. Ovid says that Libya became a desert in consequence of Phaethon's
conflagration.
In the Iliad it is said that Pallas Athene "darted down to earth a gleaming star" with sparks
springing from it; it darted as a star "sent by Jupiter to be a portent for seamen or for a wide host
of warriors, a gleaming star." 7 Athene's counterpart in the Assyro-Babylonian pantheon is
Astarte (Ishtar) who shatters mountains, "bright torch of heaven" at whose appearance "heaven
and earth quake," who causes darkness and appears in a hurricane.8 Like Astarte (Ash-terothKarnaim), Athene was pictured with horns. "Athena, daughter of Zeus . . . upon her head she set
the helmet with two horns,"

said Homer.8 Pallas Athene is identified with Astarte (Ishtar) or the planet Venus of the
Babylonians.10 Anaitis of the Iranians, too, is identified as Pallas Athene and as the planet
Venus.11
Plutarch identified Minerva of the Romans or Athene of the Greeks with Isis of the Egyptians,
and Pliny identified the planet Venus with Isis.12
It is necessary to recall this here because it is generally supposed that the Greeks had no deity of
importance who personified the planet Venus13 and that, on the other hand, they "did not find
even a star in which to place" Athene.14 Modern books on the mythology of the Greeks repeat
today what Cicero wrote: "Venus, called in Greek Phosphorus and in Latin Lucifer when it
preceded the sun, but when it follows it Hesperos." 15 Phosphorus does not play any role on
Olympus. But following Cicero in his description of the planets, we read also of "the planet
called Saturn's, the Greek name of which is Phaenon," though we know a more common name,

robin-bobin

Cronus, by which the Greeks called the planet Saturn. Cicero gives the Greek names of other
planets which are not the common ones. It is therefore entirely wrong to think that Phosphorus
and Hesperos are the chief or only names of the planet Venus in Greek. Athene, in whose honor
the city of Athens was named, was the planet Venus. Next to Zeus she was the most honored
deity of the Greeks. The name Athene in Greek, according to Manetho, "is indication of selforiginated move»Iliad v. 735.

ment." He wrote of the name Athene as meaning, "I came from myself." 18 Cicero, speaking of
Venus, explained the origin of the name thus: "Venus was so named by our countrymen as the
goddess who 'comes' [venire] to all things." 1T The name Vishnu signifies "per-vader," from the
Sanskrit vish, to "enter" or "pervade."
The birth of Athene was assigned to the middle of the second millennium. Augustine wrote:
"Minerva [Athene] is reported to have appeared ... in the times of Ogyges." This statement is
found in The City of God,18 the book containing the quotation from Varro that the planet Venus
changed its course and form in the time of Ogyges. Augustine also synchronized Joshua with the
time of Minerva's activities.19
The cover of carbonigenous clouds in which the earth was enveloped by the comet is the "robe
ambrosial" wrought by Athene for Hera (Earth) .20 The source of ambrosia was closely
connected with Athene.21 The origin of Athene as a comet is implied in her epithet Pallas which,
as is commonly known, is synonymous with Typhon; Typhon, as Pliny said, was a comet.
The bull and the cow, the goat and the serpent, were animals dedicated to Athene. "The goat
being usually tabooed but chosen as an exceptional victim for her," the animal was annually
sacrificed on the Acropolis of Athens.22 With the Israelites the goat was the victim for Azazel,
or Lucifer.

month. Why should the nineteenth day after the moon of the spring equinox be a day of wrath?
... It corresponds to the quinquatrus of the Boman farmer's calendar, the nineteenth of March,
five days after the full moon. Ovid says that Minerva was born on that day, she being the Pallas
Athene of the Greeks." 23 The nineteenth of March was Minerva's day. -.„ The first appearance
of Athene-Minerva took place on the day the Israelites crossed the Bed Sea. The night between
the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the first month after the vernal equinox was the night of
the great earthshock; six days later, on the last day of Passover week, according to the Hebrew
tradition, the waters were heaped up like mountains and the fugitives crossed on the dry bed of
the sea.
The birth of Pallas Athene or her first visit to earth was the cause of a cosmic disturbance, and
the memory of that catastrophe was "a day of wrath in all the calendars of ancient Chaldea."
Zeus and Athene
If there was a problem in this research which caused prolonged deliberation on the part of the
author, it was the question: Was it the planet Jupiter or Venus that caused the catastrophe of the
time of Exodus? Some ancient mythological sources point to Venus, other sources point to
Jupiter. In one group of legends Jupiter (Zeus) is the protagonist of the drama: he leaves his
place in the sky, rushes to battle Typhon, and strikes him with thunderbolts. But other legends
and historical sources, too, which I have quoted on previous pages indicate that it was the planet
Venus, or Pallas Athene of the Greeks. Athene killed her father, Typhon-Pallas, the celestial
mon23 Langdon, Babylonian Menologies and the Semitic Calendars (1935), pp. 86-87.

ster, and the description of this battle is not different from that of the battle in which Zeus killed
Typhon.
Under the weight of many arguments, I came to the conclusion— about which I no longer have
any doubt—that it was the planet Venus, at the time still a comet, that caused the catastrophe of
the days of Exodus. Then why do a part of the legends tie up this event with Jupiter?
The cause of this duality in the mythological handling of an historical event lies in the fact that
the ancients themselves did not know for certain which of the planets had caused the destruction.
Some saw the pillar of cloud—Typhon defeated by Jupiter, the ball of fire that emerged from the
pillar and battled with it. Others interpreted the globe as a body different from Jupiter.
The Greek authors described the birth of Athene (planet Venus), saying she sprang from the head
of Jupiter. "And mighty Olympus trembled fearfully . . . and the earth around shrieked fearfully,
and the sea was stirred, troubled with its purple waves."x One or two authors thought that Athene
was born of Cronus. But the consensus of ancient authors makes Athene-Venus the offspring of
Jupiter: she sprang from his head, and this birth was accompanied by great disturbances in the
celestial and terrestrial spheres. The comet rushed toward the earth, and it could not be very well
distinguished whether the planet Jupiter or its offspring was approaching. I may divulge here
something that belongs to the second book of this work; namely, that at an earlier time, Jupiter
had already caused havoc in the planetary family, the earth included, and it was therefore only
natural to see in the approaching body the planet Jupiter.
I referred in the introductory part of this work to the modern theory which ascribes the birth of
the terrestrial planets to the process of expulsion by larger ones. This appears to be true in the
case of Venus. The other modern theory, which ascribes the origin of comets of short period to
expulsion by large planets, is also correct: Venus was expelled as a comet and then changed to a
planet after contact with a number of members of the solar system.

Venus, being an offspring of Jupiter, bore all the characteristics known to men from early
cataclysmic encounters. When a ball of fire tore the pillar of cloud and pelted the pillar with
thunderbolts, the imagination of the people saw in this the planet-god Jupiter-Marduk rushing to
save the earth by killing the serpent-monster Typhon-Tiamat.
It is not strange, therefore, that, in places as remote from Greece as the islands of Polynesia, it is
related that "the planet Jupiter suppressed the tail of the great storm." 2 But we are told that in
the same places, notably on the Harvey Islands, "Jupiter was often mistaken for the Morning
Star." 3 On other islands of Polynesia, "the planets Venus and Jupiter seem to have been
confused with each other." Explorers found "that the name Fauma or Paupiti was given to Venus
. . . and that the same names were given to Jupiter." *
Early astronomy shared Ptolemy's opinion that "Venus has the same powers" and also the nature
of Jupiter,5 an opinion reflected also in the astrological belief that "Venus, when she becomes
sole ruler of the event, in general brings about results similar to those of Jupiter." •
In one local cult in Egypt the name of Isis, as I shall show in the next volume, originally
belonged to Jupiter, Osiris being Saturn. In another local cult Amon was the name for Jupiter.
Horus originally was also Jupiter.7 But when a new planet was born of Jupiter and became
supreme in the sky, the onlookers could not readily recognize the exact nature of this change.
They gave the name of Isis to the planet Venus, and sometimes the name of Horus. This must
have caused confusion. "One is confused by the various relations which exist between mother
and son (Isis and Horus). Now he is her consort, now her brother; now a youth . . . now an infant

Also Ishtar of Assyria-Babylonia was in early times the name of the planet Jupiter; later it was
transferred to Venus, Jupiter retaining the name of Mardulc.
Baal, still another name for Jupiter, was an earlier name for Saturn, and later on became the
name of Venus, sometimes the feminine form Baalath or Belith being used.10 Ishtar, also, was at
first a male planet, subsequently becoming a female planet.11
Worship of the Morning Star
Now that it has been shown it was Venus which, at an interval of fifty-two years, caused two
cosmic catastrophes in the fifteenth century before the present era, we understand also the
different historical connections between Venus and these catastrophes.
In numerous biblical and rabbinical passages it is said that when the Israelites went from Mount
Sinai into the desert, they were covered by clouds. These clouds were illuminated by the pillar of
fire, so that they gave a pale light.1 With this should be connected a statement of Isaiah: "The
people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow
of death, the light of Noga was upon them." 2 Noga is Venus; it is, in fact, the usual name of this
planet in Hebrew,3 and it is therefore an omission not to translate it so.

>>Amos says that during the forty years in the wilderness the Israelites did not sacrifice to the
Lord, but carried "the star of your god, which you made to yourselves." 4 St. Jerome interprets
this "star of your god" as Lucifer (the Morning Star).5 ^> What image of the star was carried in
the wilderness? Was it the bull (calf) of Aaron or the brazen serpent of Moses? "And Moses
made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole." 6 Of this serpent it is said that it was made with
the purpose of providing a cure for those bitten by snakes.7 Seven and a half centuries later this
brazen serpent of Moses was broken by King Hezekiah, guided in his monotheistic zeal by the
prophet Isaiah, "for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it." 8
The brazen serpent was most probably the image of the pillar of cloud and fire which appeared
as a moving serpent to all peoples of the world. St. Jerome apparently had this image in view
when he interpreted the star mentioned by Amos as Lucifer. Or was it the "star of David," the
six-pointed star?
The Egyptian Venus-Isis, the Babylonian Venus-Ishtar, the Greek Venus-Athene were goddesses
pictured with serpents, and sometimes

7 Those who were bitten by serpents looked at the brazen serpent for cure. Can a psychosomatic
relationship go such a long way? The practices of the snake worshipers lend some credence to
the physiological background of Numbers 21 : 9. But it is outside the scope of the present
research to go into these details.
The fact that Moses made an image—in violation of the second commandment of the
Decalogue—is not necessarily inconsistent with his being monotheist: there are many churches
today where symbolic and even human figures are deified by people who profess to be
monotheists. But as time passed, the presence of the serpent of Moses in the Temple of
Jerusalem became so objectionable to the spirit of the prophets that in the days of Isaiah the
serpent was broken into pieces. Even though its original purpose may have been curative, it
being the image of the angel who was sent in the pillar of fire and cloud to save the people of
Israel from slavery, the brazen serpent with the lapse of time became an object of worship.

The Morning Star of the Toltecs, Quetzal-cohuatl (Quetzal-coatl), also is represented as a great
dragon or serpent: "cohuatl" in Nahuatl is "serpent," and the name means "a feathered
serpent."10 The Morning Star of the Indians of the Chichimec tribe in Mexico is called "Serpent
cloud," n a remarkable name because of its relation to the pillar of cloud and the clouds that
covered the globe after the contact of the earth with Venus.
When Quetzal-cohuatl, the lawgiver of the Toltecs, disappeared on the approach of a great
catastrophe and the Morning Star that bore the same name rose for the first time in the sky, the
Toltecs "regulated the reckoning of the days, the nights, and the hours according to the difference
in the time."12

Baal of the Canaanites and of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was worshiped in Dan, the city of

Babylonian holy trinity in the fourteenth century before the present era.21
In the Vedas the planet Venus is compared to a bull: "As a bull thou hurlest thy fire upon earth
and heaven." 22 The Morning Star of the Phoenicians and Syrians was Ashteroth-Karnaim,
Astarte of the Horns. Belith of Sidon was likewise Venus, and Izebel, wife of Ahab, made her
the chief deity of the Northern Kingdom.23 The "queen of heaven," referred to repeatedly by
Jeremiah, was Venus. The women of Jerusalem made cakes for the queen of heaven and
worshiped her from the roofs of their houses.24
On Cyprus it was neither Jupiter nor any other god but "Kypris Queen whom they with holy gifts

Not long ago, in Polynesia, human sacrifices were offered to the Morning Star, Venus.26 To the

was described by early Spanish authors,28 and was still practiced by Indians only a generation
ago.29 Quetzal-cohuatl "was called the god of winds" and of "flames of fire";30 the Greek

and fire. The planet Venus was Lux Divina, the Divine Light, in the worship of the Roman
imperial colonies.31
In Babylonia, Venus was pictured as a six-pointed star—which is also the shape of David's
shield—or as a pentagram—a five-pointed star (seal of Solomon)—and sometimes as a cross; as
a cross it was pictured in Mexico, too.
The attributes and deeds of the Morning Star were not invented by the peoples of the world: this
star shattered mountains, shook the globe with such a violence that it looked as if the heavens
were shaking, was a storm, a cloud, a fire, a heavenly dragon, a torch, and a blazing star, and it
rained naphtha on the earth.
Assurbanipal speaks of Ishtar-Venus, "who is clothed with fire and bears aloft a crown of awful
splendor, [and who] rained fire over Arabia." 32 It has been shown previously that the comet of
the days of the Exodus rained naphtha over Arabia.
In the attributes and in the deeds ascribed to the planet Venus— Isis, Ishtar, Athene—we
recognize the attributes and deeds of the comet described in the earlier sections of this book.
The Sacred Cow
The comet Venus, of which it is said that "horns grew out of her head," or Astarte of the horns,
Venus cornuta, looked like the head of a horned animal; and since it moved the earth out of its
place, like a bull with its horns, the planet Venus was pictured as a bull. i> The worship of a

robin-bobin

bullock was introduced by Aaron at the foot of Mount Sinai. The cult of Apis originated in Egypt
in the days of the Hyksos, after the end of the Middle Kingdom,1 shortly after the Exodus. Apis,
or the sacred bull, was very much venerated in Egypt; when a sacred bull died, its body was
mummified and placed in a sarcophagus with royal honors, and memorial services were held.

"All the coffins and everything excellent and profitable for this august god (the bull Apis)" were

The worship of a cow or bull was widespread in Minoan Crete and in Mycenaean Greece, for
golden images of this animal with large horns were found in excavations.
Isis, the planet Venus,3 was represented as a human figure with two horns, like Astarte (Ishtar)
of the horns; and sometimes it was fashioned in the likeness of a cow. In time, Ishtar changed
from male to female, and in many places worship of the bull changed to worship of the cow. The
main reason for this seems to have been the fall of manna which turned the rivers into streams of
honey and milk. A horned planet that produced milk most closely resembled a cow. In the
Hymns of the Aiharva-Veda, in which the ambrosia that falls from the sky is glorified, the god is
exalted as the "great cow" which "drips with streams of milk" and as "a bull" that "hurlest thy
fire upon earth and heaven."4 A passage of the Ramayana about the "celestial cow" says: "Honey
she gave, and roasted grain . . . and curled milk, and soup in lakes with sugared milk,"5 which is
the Hindu version of "rivers of milk and honey."
The "celestial cow" or "the heavenly Surabhi" ("the fragrant") was the daughter of the Creator:
she "sprung from his mouth"; at the same time nectar and "excellent perfume" were spread,
according to the Indian epic.6 This description of the birth of the daughter from the mouth of the
Creator is a Hindu parallel of Athene springing from the head of Zeus. Fragrance and nectar are
mentioned in connection with the birth of the celestial cow, a combination that can be
understood if we recall what we learned in the Sections "Ambrosia" and "Birth of the Planet
Venus."

Down to the present day, the Brahmans worship the cow. Cows are regarded as daughters of the
"heavenly cow." In India, as in other places, the worship of cows began in some period of
recorded history. "We find in early Hindu literature sufficient information to establish the thesis
that cows were once victimised at sacrifices and used at times as articles of food."7 Then came
the change. Cows became sacred animals, and ever since the religious law has forbidden the use
of their meat for food. The Atharva-Veda repeatedly deprecates cow-killing as "the most heinous
of crimes." "All that kill, eat or permit the slaughter of cows rot in hell for as many years as there
are hairs on the body of the cow slain." 8 Capital punishment was prescribed for those who either
stole, hurt, or killed a cow. "Whoever hurts or causes another to hurt, or steals or causes another
to steal, a cow, should be slain." Even cows' urine and dung are sacred to the Brahmans. "All its
excreta are hallowed. Not a particle ought to be thrown away as impure. On the contrary, the
water it ejects ought to be preserved as the best of holy waters. . . . Any spot which a cow has
condescended to honour with the sacred deposit of her excrement is forever afterwards
consecrated ground." 9 Sprinkled on a sinner, it "converts him into a saint."

The bull is sacred to Shiva, "the god of destruction in the Hindu Trinity." "The consecration of
the bulls and letting them loose as privileged beings to roam at their will and draw respect from
all people is to be noted with particular interest. . . . The freedom and privileges of the Brahman
bull are inviolate." Even when it is destructive, the bull must not be restrained.10
These quotations show the Apis cult preserved until our times. The "celestial cow" that gored the
earth with its horns and turned rivers and lakes into honey and milk is still revered in the
common cow and bull by hundreds of millions of the people of India.

Baal Zevuv (Beelzebub)
The beautiful Morning Star was related to Ahriman, Seth, Lucifer, name equivalents of Satan. It
was also Baal of the Canaanites and of the Northern Kingdom of the Ten Tribes, the god hated
by the biblical prophets, also Beelzebub or Baal Zevuv, or Baal of the fly.
In the Pahlavi text of the Iranian book, the Bundahis, describing the catastrophes caused by
celestial bodies, it is written that at the close of one of the world ages "the evil spirit [Ahriman]
went toward the luminaries." "He stood upon one-third of the inside of the sky, and he sprang,
like a snake, out of the sky down to the earth." It was the day of the vernal equinox. "He rushed
in at noon," and "the sky was shattered and frightened." "Like a fly, he rushed out upon the
whole creation, and he injured the world and made it dark at midday as though it were in dark
night. And noxious creatures were diffused by him over the earth, biting and venomous, such as
the snake, scorpion, frog, and lizard, so that not so much as the point of a needle remained free
from noxious creatures." *
Then the Bundahis proceeds: "The planets, with many demons [comets], dashed against the
celestial sphere, and they mixed the constellations; and the whole creation was as disfigured as
though fire disfigured every place and smoke arose over it."
similar plague of vermin is described in the Scriptures, in Exodus, Chapters 8 to 10, and also in
Psalm 78 where it is told that there were sent "divers sorts of flies among them [the people of
Egypt], which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them." Their labor was given to the
caterpillar and the locust. "The dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt."2
"And there came a grievous swarm of flies . . . into all the land of Egypt." 3 The second, third,
fourth, and eighth plagues were caused by vermin. The plague of eruv, "swarms of flies" of the
King James Version, is translated in the Septuagint, "a stinging fly," and Philo calls it "the dogfly," a ferocious insect; 4 it is also called "gnat" by the rabbis. Psalm 105 narrates that

darkness was sent upon the country and 'locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number,

The Amalekites left Arabia because of "ants of the smallest kind" and wandered toward Canaan
and Egypt at the same time that the Israelites went from Egypt toward the desert and Canaan.
In the Chinese annals describing the time of Yahou, from which I quoted previously, it is said
that when the sun did not set for ten days and the forests of China were destroyed by fire,
multitudes of loathsome vermin were bred in the entire land. N. During their wanderings in the
desert, the Israelites were plagued by serpents.5 A generation later, hornets preceded the
Israelites under Joshua, plaguing the land of Canaan and driving entire nations from their
domiciles.6

The inhabitants of the islands in the South Seas relate that when the clouds lay only a few feet
from the ground and "the sky was so close to the earth that men could not walk," "myriads of

After the close of the Middle Kingdom, the Egyptian standard bore the emblem of a fly.
^ When Venus sprang out of Jupiter as a comet and flew very close to the earth, it became
entangled in the embrace of the earth. The internal heat developed by the earth and the scorching
gases of the comet were in themselves sufficient to make the vermin of the earth propagate at a
very feverish rate. Some of the plagues, like the plague of the frogs ("the land brought forth
frogs") or of the locusts, must be ascribed to such causes. Anyone who has experienced a

knows how, during the few days that the wind blows, the ground around the villages begins to
teem with vermin.8
The question arises here whether or not the comet Venus infested the earth with vermin which it
may have carried in its trailing atmosphere in the form of larvae together with stones and gases.
It is significant that all around the world peoples have associated the planet Venus with flies.
In Ekron, in the land of the Philistines, there was erected a magnificent temple to Baal Zevuv,
the god of the fly. In the ninth century King Ahaziah of Jezreel, after he was injured in an
accident, sent his emissaries to ask advice of this god at Ekron and not of the oracle at
Jerusalem.9 This Baal Zevuv is Beelzebub of the Gospels.10
Ahriman, the god of darkness who battled with Ormuzd, the god of light, is compared in the
Bundahis to a fly. Of the flies that filled the earth buried in gloom it is said: "His multitudes of
flies scatter themselves over the world that is poisoned through and through." u
Ares (Mars) in the Iliad calls Athene "dog-fly." "The gods clashed with a mighty din, and the
wide earth rang, and round about great heaven pealed as with a trumpet." And Ares spoke to
Athene: "Wherefore now again, thou dog-fly, art making gods to clash with gods in strife?" 12
The people of Bororo in central Brazil call the planet Venus "the sand fly," 13 an appellation
similar to that which Homer used for Athene. The Bantu tribes of central Africa relate that the
"sand fly brought fire from the sky," 14 which appears to be a reference to the Promethean role

the stars against the planets" (Darmesteter), refers to worm-stars that "fly between the earth and
heaven," and that supposedly signify the meteorites.15 Possibly it is a reference to their infesting
property.
This idea of contaminating comets is found in a belief of the Mexicans described by Sahagun:
"The Mexicans called the comet citlalin popoca which means a smoking star. . . . These natives
called the tail of such a star citlalin tlamina, exhalation of the comet; or, literally, 'the star shoots
a dart.' They believed that when such a dart fell on a living organism, a hare, a rabbit, or any
other animal, worms suddenly formed in the wound and made the animal unfit to serve as food.

robin-bobin

It was for this reason that they took great care to cover themselves during the night so as to
protect themselves from this inflaming emanation." 16
The Mexicans thus thought that larvae from the emanation of the comet fell on all living things.
As I have already mentioned, they called Venus a "smoking star." Sahagun says also that at the
rising of the Morning Star, the Mexicans used to shut the chimneys and other apertures in order
to prevent mishap from penetrating into the house together with the light of the star.17
"^/The persistence with which the planet Venus is associated with a fly in the traditions of the
peoples of both hemispheres, also the emblems carried by the Egyptian priests and the temple
services conducted in honor of the planet-god "of the fly," create the impression that the flies in
the tail of Venus were not merely the earthly brood, swarming in heat like other vermin, but
guests from another planet.
The old question, whether there is life on other planets, has been debated time and again without
much progress.18 Atmospheric and thermal conditions are so different on other planets that it
seems incredible that the same forms of life exist there as on the earth; on
is Zend-Avesta, Pt. II, p. 95.

the other hand, it is wrong to conclude that there is no life on them at all.
Modern biologists toy with the idea that microorganisms arrive on the earth from interstellar
spaces, carried by the pressure of light. Hence, the idea of the arrival of living organisms from
interplanetary spaces is not new. Whether there is truth in this supposition of larval
contamination of the earth is anyone's guess. The ability of many small insects and their larvae to
endure great cold and heat and to live in an atmosphere devoid of oxygen renders not entirely
improbable the hypothesis that Venus (and also Jupiter, from which Venus sprang) may be
populated by vermin.
Venus in the Folklore of the Indians
Primitive peoples often are bound by inflexible customs and beliefs that date back hundreds of
generations. The traditions of many primitive races speak of a "lower sky" in the past, a 'larger
sun," a swifter movement of the sun across the firmament, a shorter day that became longer after
the sun was arrested on its path.
World conflagration is a frequent motif in folklore. According to the Indians of the Pacific coast
of North America the "shooting star" and the "fire drill" set the world aflame. In the burning
world one "could see nothing but waves of flames; rocks were burning, the ground was burning,
everything was burning. Great rolls and piles of smoke were rising; fire flew up toward the sky
in flames, in great sparks and brands. . . . The great fire was blazing, roaring all over the earth,
burning rocks, earth, trees, people, burning everything. . . . Water rushed in ... it rushed in like a
crowd of rivers, covered the earth, and put out the fire as it rolled on toward the south. . . . Water
rose mountain high." A celestial monster flew with "a whistle in his mouth; as he moved forward
he blew it with all his might, and made a terrible noise. . . . He came flowing and blowing; he
looked like an enormous bat with wings spread . . . [his] feathers waved up and down, [and]
grew till they could touch the sky on both sides." * 1 Alexander. North American Mythology, p.
223.

The shooting star that made the earth into a sea of flames, the terrible noise, the water that rose
mountain high, and the appearance of a monster in the sky, like Typhon or a dragon, all these
elements were not brought together in this Indian narrative by sheer invention; they belong
together.
The Wichita, an Indian tribe of Oklahoma, tell the following story of "The Deluge and the
Repeopling of the Earth": 2 "There came to the people some signs, which showed that there was

robin-bobin

something in the north that looked like clouds; and the fowl of the air came, and the animals of
the plains and woods were seen. All of this indicated that something was to happen. The clouds
that were seen in the north were a deluge. The deluge was all over the face of the earth."
The water monsters succumbed. Only four giants remained, but they fell, too, each on his face.
"The one in the south as he was falling said that the direction he fell should be called south." The
other giant said that "the direction in which he was falling should be called west—Where-thesun-goes." The third fell and named the direction of his fall north; the last called his direction
"east—Where-the-sun-rises."
Only a few men survived. The wind also survived on the face of the earth; everything else was
destroyed. A child was born to a woman (from the wind), a Dream-girl. The girl grew rapidly. A
boy child was born to her. "He told his people that he would go in the direction of the east, and
he was to become the Morning Star."
This tale sounds like an incoherent story, but let us note its various elements: "something in the
north that looked like clouds" which made people and animals huddle together in apprehension
of an approaching catastrophe; wild beasts emerging from the forests and coming to human
abodes; an engulfing tide that destroyed everything, even the monster animals; the determination
of the new four quarters of the horizon; a generation later the birth of the Morning Star.
This combination of elements cannot be accidental; all these

events, and in the same sequence, were found to have occurred in the middle of the second
millennium before the present era.
The Indians of the Chewkee tribe on the Gulf Coast tell: "It was too hot. The sun was put 'a
handbreadth' higher in the air, but it was still too hot. Seven times the sun was lifted higher and
higher under the sky arch, until it became cooler." 3
In eastern Africa we can trace the same tradition. "In very old times the sky was very close to the
earth." 4
The Kaska tribe in the interior of British Columbia relate: "Once a long time ago the sky was
very close to the earth." s The sky was pushed up and the weather changed.
The sun, after being stopped on its way across the firmament, "became small, and small it has
remained since then." •
Here is a story, told to Shelton by the Snohomish tribe on Puget Sound, about the origin of the
exclamation "Yahu," 7 to which I have already referred briefly. "A long time ago, when all the
animals were still human beings, the sky was very low. It was so low that the people could not
stand erect. . . . They called a meeting together and discussed how they could raise the sky. But
they were at a loss to know how to do so. No one was strong enough to lift the sky. Finally the
idea occurred to them that possibly the sky might be moved by the combined efforts of the
people, if all of them pushed against it at the same time. But then the question arose of how it
would be possible to make all the people exert their efforts at exactly the same moment. For the
different peoples would be far away from one another, some would be in this part of the world,
others in another part. What signal could be given that all people would lift at precisely the same
time? Finally, the word 'Yahu!' was invented for this purpose. It was decided that all the people
should shout Tahu!'

together, and then exert their whole strength in lifting the sky. In accordance with this, the people
equipped themselves with poles, braced them against the sky, and then all shouted 'Yahu!' in
unison. Under their combined efforts the sky rose a little. Again the people shouted 'Yahu!' and

robin-bobin

lifted the heavy weight. They repeated this until the sky was sufficiently high." Shelton says that
the word "Yahu" is used today when some heavy object like a large canoe is being lifted.
It is easy to recognize the origin of this legend. Clouds of dust and gases enveloped the earth for
a long time; it seemed that the sky had descended low. The earth groaned repeatedly because of
the severe twisting and dislocation it had experienced. Only slowly and gradually did the clouds
lift themselves from the ground.
The clouds that enveloped the Israelites in the desert, the trumpetlike sounds that they heard at
Mount Sinai, and the gradual lifting of the clouds in the years of the Shadow of Death are the
same elements that we find in this Indian legend.
Because the same elements can be recognized in very different settings, we can affirm that there
was no borrowing from one people by another. A common experience created the stories, so
dissimilar at first, and so much alike on second thought.
The story of the end of the world, as related by the Pawnee Indians, has an important content. It
was written down8 from the mouth of an old Indian:
"We are told by the old people that the Morning Star ruled over all the minor gods in the
heavens. . . . The old people told us that the Morning Star said that when the time came for the
world to end, the Moon would turn red . . . that when the Moon should turn red, the people
would know that the world was coming to an end.
"The Morning Star said further that in the beginning of all things they placed the North Star in
the north, so that it should not move. . . . The Morning Star also said that in the beginning of all
things they gave power to the South Star for it to move up close, once in a while, to look at the
North Star to see if it were still standing in the north. If it were still standing there, it was to
move back to its
8 Dorsey, ed., The Pawnee Mythology (1906), Pt. I, v>. 35.
WORLDS IN COLLISION
191
place. . . . When the time approached for the world to end, the South Star would come higher. . . .
The North Star would then disappear and move away and the South Star would take possession
of the earth and of the people. . . . The old people knew also that when the world was to come to
an end, there were to be many signs. Among the stars would be many signs. Meteors would fly
through the sky. The Moon would change its color once in a while. The Sun would also show
different colors.
"My grandchild, some of the signs have come to pass. The stars have fallen among the people,
but the Morning Star is still good to us, for we continue to live. . . . The command for the ending
of all things will be given by the North Star, and the South Star will carry out the command. . . .
When the time comes for the ending of the world, the stars will again fall to the earth."
In this narrative of the Pawnee Indians, elements are brought together which, as we know now,
actually belong together. The planet Venus established the present order on the earth and placed
the north and south polar stars in their places. The Pawnees believe that the future destruction of
the world depends on the planet Venus. When the end of the world will come, the North and
South poles will change places. In the past the South Star left its place a few times and came up
higher, bringing about a shifting of the poles, but on these occasions the polar stars did not
reverse their positions.
The change in the color of the sun and the moon was conditioned by the presence of cometary
gases between the earth and these bodies; it is referred to in the Prophets of the Scriptures.
Stones falling from the sky belong to the same complex of phenomena.
The Pawnee Indians are not versed in astronomy. For one hundred and twenty generations father
has transmitted to son and grandfather to grandchild the story of the past and the signs of future
destruction.
The belief that the world is endangered by the planet Venus plays an important role in the ritual
of the Skidi Pawnee Indians of Nebraska.

Next in rank to Tirawa (Jupiter) stands the Morning Star. "Tirawa gave most of his power to the
Morning Star." 9 "Through her four assistants, Wind, Cloud, Lightning, and Thunder, she
transmitted the mandates of Tirawa to the people upon earth." Next in rank to the Morning Star
"were the gods of four world-quarters, who stood in the northeast, southeast, southwest, and
northwest and supported the heavens. Next in rank was the North Star. Below these in turn were
the Sun and Moon." "The greater part of the heavenly gods were identified with stars. The sacred
bundle of each village was believed to have been given to its ancestors by one of these heavenly
beings."
The ceremony of sacrifice to the Morning Star is the main ritual of the Pawnee Indians. It is a
"dramatization of the acts performed by the Morning Star." A human offering was sacrificed
when Venus "appeared especially bright or in years when there was a comet in the sky." The act
of appeasing Venus when a comet was seen in the sky takes on clearer meaning in the light of
the present research.10
The sacrificial procedure took the following form. A captive girl was turned over by her captor
to a man who would howl like a wolf. She was kept by the guardian until the day of the sacrifice.
"Her guardian then painted her whole body red and dressed her in a black skirt and robe. His face
and hair were painted red, and a fan-shaped headdress of twelve eagle feathers was attached to
his hair." "This was the costume in which the Morning Star usually appeared in visions."
The scaffold was erected between four poles that pointed to the four quarters (northeast,
southeast, southwest, northwest). A few words were pronounced about the darkness that
threatened to endure forever, and in the name of the Morning Star a command was addressed to
the poles to keep upright "so that you will always hold up the heavens."
The chief priest then "painted the right half of her body red and

the left half black. A headdress of twelve black-tipped eagle feathers, arranged like a fan, was
fastened on her head."
"At the moment the Morning Star appeared, two men came forward bearing firebrands." The
breast of the girl was cut open and the heart taken out, and "the guardian thrust his hand into the
thoracic cavity and painted his face with the blood." The people around shot arrows into the
body of the victim. "Boys too young to draw a bow were helped by their fathers or mothers."
Four bundles were laid northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest of the scaffold and were
ignited.
"There seem to have been astronomical beliefs connected with the sacrifices."
These human sacrifices, as described by Dorsey, were executed by the Indians only a few
decades ago. They recall the Mexican sacrifices to the Morning Star described by the authors of
the sixteenth century.
The meaning of these ceremonies and their relation to the planet Venus, especially in the years of
a comet, the references to the cardinal points and to prolonged darkness, the anxiety that the sky
should not fall, and even such details as the black and red colors so important in the ceremonies,
become understandable now that we know the role Venus played in world upheavals.
CHAPTER 10
The Synodical Year of Venus
THE PLANET Venus, at the present time, revolves around the sun in 288 days, which is the
siderial year of the planet. However, seen from the earth, which revolves around the sun on a
larger orbit and at a lower speed, Venus returns to the same position with respect to the earth
after 584 days, which is its synodical year. It rises before the sun, earlier every day for seventyone days, until it reaches the western elongation or its westernmost point away from the rising
sun. Each morning thereafter the Morning Star rises lower and lower and for 221 days

robin-bobin

approaches the superior conjunction. About a month before the end of this period, it is eclipsed
by the rays of the sun, and for over sixty days it is not seen because of the sun's rays: it is behind
the sun or in superior conjunction. Then it appears for a moment after the setting sun, being now
the Evening Star and east of the western sun. For 221 nights it retreats from the middle point of
the superior conjunction, and beginning with the evening on which it first appears as an Evening
Star, each night it appears farther from the setting sun until it reaches the eastern elongation.
Then for seventy-one nights it approaches the sun. Finally it enters the inferior conjunction,
when it is between the earth and the sun. It is usually invisible for one or two days, and thereafter
appears west of the rising sun and is again the Morning Star.
These movements of Venus and their exact duration have been known to the people of the Orient
and the Occident for over two thousand years. Actually a "Venus year," which follows the
synodical
194
WORLDS IN COLLISION
195
revolution of Venus, was employed in calendars of the Old and New World alike. Five synodical
years of Venus equal 2919.6 days, whereas eight years of 365 days equal 2920 days, and eight
Julian years of 365/4 days equal 2922 days. In other words, in four years there is a difference of
approximately one day between the Venus and the Julian calendars.
As I shall show in more detail in my reconstruction of ancient history, the Egyptians of the
second part of the first pre-Christian millennium observed the Venus year. A decree published in
Egyptian and in Greek by the conclave of priests which took place in Canopus in the reign of
Ptolemy III (Euergetes) in —239 was intended to reform the calendar "according to the present
arrangement of the world" and "an amendment of the faults of the heaven," replacing the year
regulated by the rising of the star Isis—and Pliny says that Isis is the planet Venus x—with a
year regulated by the rising of the fixed star Sothis (Sirius); this would make a difference of one
day in four years, so that, as the decree says, "the festivals of the winter should not arrive in the
summer because of the change of a day every four years in the rising of the star Isis." 2
The reform intended by the Canopus Decree did not take root because the people and the
conservatives among the priests kept faith with Venus and observed the New Year and other
festivals on the days regulated by it. As a matter of fact, we know that the Ptolemaic pharaohs
were obliged to swear in the temple of Isis (Venus) that they would not reform the calendar, nor
add a day every four years. Julius Caesar actually followed the Canopus Decree by fixing a
calendar of 365/4 days. In —26 Augustus introduced the Julian year in Alexandria, but the
Egyptians outside Alexandria still continued to observe the Venus year of 365 days, and
Claudius Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer of the second Christian century, wrote in his
Almagest: "Eight Egyptian years without a sensible error equal five circlings of Venus." 3
As this period of eight years can be divided in two, each part being

equal to two and a half synodical periods, the dividing point being alternately at a heliacal
(simultaneous with the sun) rising or setting of Venus, the Egyptians of the second half of the
last millennium before the present era observed a four-year cycle. This is the meaning of
Horapollo's information that the Egyptian year is equal to four years.4 In like manner the Greeks
counted by four-year cycles dedicated to Athene: the Olympic games took place every fourth
year (in the beginning, every eighth year5), and time was reckoned by the Olympiads. The
Olympic games were started in the eighth century. At the Parthenon in Athens every fourth year
was celebrated by the Pan-athenaic processions in honor of Athene.
The Incas of Peru in South America and the Mayas and Toltecs in Central America observed the
synodical revolution of Venus and the Venus year in addition to the solar year.6 They also
calculated by groups of five Venus years equal to eight years of 365 days. Like the Egyptians

robin-bobin

and the Greeks, the Mayas observed the four-year cycles,7 from the inferior to the superior and
from the superior to the inferior conjunctions of Venus. The Incas correctly marked the Venus
calendar by tying knots in their quipus,8 and the Mayas, in the Dresden Codex, correctly gave
the length of the Venus synodical cycle as 584 days.9 The astronomical observations of the
Mayas were so precise that in computing the solar year, they arrived at figures not only more
accurate than the Julian year, but also more accurate than the Gregorian year, introduced in
Europe in 1582, ninety years after the discovery of America, which is our calendar year today.10
All this proves that the Venus calendar preserved its religious significance for a long time, down
to the end of the Middle Ages and

the discovery of America, and even thereafter, but that already in the eighth century before the
present era an eight or double four-year cycle of Venus was observed in time reckoning and
therefore must have been established in the celestial sphere.
A few decades after the discovery of America, the Augustinian friar Ramon y Zamora wrote that
the Mexican tribes held the Morning Star in great veneration and kept a precise record of its
appearance: "So exact was the book-record of the day when it appeared and when it concealed
itself, that they never made mistakes." u
This was a very old custom originating in a past when Venus moved on an elongated orbit.
The movements of Venus were carefully watched by the ancient astronomers of Mexico, India,
Iran, and Babylonia. Temple observatories for the cult of the planets were built in both
hemispheres. The bamot or "high places" so often mentioned in the Scriptures were observatories
as well as places for offerings to the planet-gods, chiefly Venus (Baal). On these high places
idolatrous priests, ordained by the erring kings of Judah, burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and
the moon, and to the planets.12
In the second half of the second millennium and in the beginning of the first millennium, Venus
was still a comet; and though a comet can have a circular orbit—there is such a comet in the
solar system 13 —Venus was not then moving on a circular orbit as it does now; its orbit crossed
the orbit of the earth and endangered it every fifty years. Since, by the second half of the eighth
century before the present era, Venus' cycle was similar to what it is today, it follows that some
time before then Venus must have changed its orbit and achieved its present circular path
between Mercury and the earth and become the Morning and Evening Star.
The irregularities in the movements of Venus must have been observed by the ancients; the data
in the ancient records must differ

Venus Moves Irregularly
In the library of Assurbanipal in Nineveh were stored astronomical books of his and of previous
ages; in the ruins of this library Sir Henry Layard found the Venus tablets.1

robin-bobin

There arose the question: From what period do the observations of these tablets date?
Schiaparelli investigated this problem and "as an example of method his work is excellent." 2 He
decided that "the inquiry could be limited to the seventh and eighth centuries."
The year-formula of an early king, Ammizaduga, was discovered on one of the tablets, and since
then the tablets are usually ascribed to the first Babylonian dynasty; however, a scholar has
offered evidence to the effect that the year-formula of Ammizaduga was inserted by a scribe in
the seventh century.3 (If the tablets originated in the beginning of the second millennium, they
would prove only that Venus was even then an errant comet.)
Following are a few excerpts from the Venus tablets:
"On the 11th of Sivan, Venus disappeared in the west, remaining absent in the sky for 9 months
and 4 days, and on the 15th of Adar she was seen in the east."
The next year, "on the 10th of Arahsamna, Venus disappeared in the east, remaining absent 2
months and 6 days in the sky, and was seen on the 16th of Tebit in the west."
The following year Venus disappeared in the west on the 26th of

Schiaparelli, "Venusbeobachtungen und Berechnungen der Babylonier," Das Weltall, Vols. VI,

3 Kugler ascribed the Venus tablets to the first Babylonian Dynasty, because he read a yearformula of Ammizaduga in one of them. In 1920, F. Hommel (Assyriologische Bibliothek,
XXV, 197-199) declared that the year-formula of Ammizaduga was inserted into the Venus
tablets by a scribe in the reign of Assurbanipal, in the seventh century.

Ulul (Elul), remaining absent from the sky for eleven days, and was seen on the 7th of
intercalary Ulul in the east.
The year thereafter Venus disappeared in the east on the 9th of Nisan, remaining absent for 5
months and 16 days, and was seen on the 25th of Ulul in the west.
In the fifth year of the observations, Venus disappeared in the west on the 5th of Ayar (Ijar),
remaining absent from the sky for seven days, and reappeared in the east on the 12th of Ayar; the
same year it disappeared on the 20th of Tebit in the east, remaining absent from the sky one
month, and on the 21st day of Sabat (Shevat) it appeared in the west, and so on.
How explain these observations of the ancient astronomers, modern astronomers and historians
have asked. Were they written in a conditional form ("If Venus disappeared on the 11th of Sivan
. . .") ? No, they were expressed categorically.
The observations were "inaccurately" registered, decided some authors. However, inaccuracy
may account for a few days' difference but not for a difference of months.
"The invisibility of Venus at superior conjunction is given as 5 months 16 days instead of the
correct difference of 2 months 6 days," noted the translators of the text, wonderingly.4
"The period between the heliacal setting of Venus and its rise is 72 days. But in the BabylonianAssyrian astrological texts, the period varies from one month to five months—too long and too
short: the observations were defective," wrote another scholar.5
"The impossible interval shows that the data are not trustworthy." "Obviously, the days of the
month have been mixed up. As the impossible intervals show, the months are also wrong," wrote
still another author.8
It is difficult to imagine how such obvious errors could have been committed. The dates are
written in a contemporary document; they are not a poetical composition but a dry record, and
each item in the

record is stated in dates as well as in the number of days between the dates.
Similar difficulties are encountered by the scholars who try to understand the Hindu tables of the
movements of the planets. The only explanation proposed is: "All the manuscripts are
completely corrupted. . . . The details referring to Venus . . . are very difficult to unriddle."7 "No
attention at all was paid to the actual movements in the sky." 8
The Babylonians did not note these irregular movements merely as matters of factual interest;
they were dismayed by them. In their prayers they expressed this dismay.

and felt themselves out of danger for another period. But when Venus, for some reason, began to
move irregularly, fear grew intense. The priests of Iran prayed: 10
We sacrifice to Tistrya, the bright and glorious star, for whom long flocks and herds and men,
looking forward for him and deceived in their hope: When shall we see him rise up, the bright
and glorious star Tistrya?
The Zend-Avesta answered for the star:
If men would worship me with a sacrifice in which I were invoked by my own name . . . then I
should come to the faithful at the appointed time.
The priests responded:
The next ten nights, O Spitama Zarathustra!
the bright and glorious Tistrya mingles his shape with light,
moving in the shape of a golden-horned bull.
They glorified the star that made "all the shores of the ocean boiling over, all the middle of it
boiling over." They heaped up sacrifices to the star, imploring it not to change its course.
We sacrifice unto Tistrya, the bright and glorious star
who from the shining east moves along his long winding course,

The star of Venus did not appear in the prescribed seasons. In the Book of Job the Lord asks
him: "Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season . . . ? Knowest thou the changes of
heaven?" n
10 Zend-Avesta (transl. Darmesteter), Pt. II, pp. 94 ff. The belief sometimes expressed, that
Tistrya is Sirius, is an obvious error: Sirius does not travel in a winding course. The star in the
shape of a golden-horned bull was Venus. Also, inaccurate movements of Sirius could not occur
without similar irregularity on the part of all the stars.

The Septuagint has "the changes of heaven."

There exists an extensive exegetic literature on this Mazzaroth,12 from which it can be
concluded only that "the meaning of Mazzaroth is uncertain."13 But the Vulgate (Latin)
translation of the Bible has Lucifer for Mazzaroth. The (Greek) translation of the Seventy
(Septuagint) reads: "Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season and guide the Evening Star
by his long hair?" These words of the Septuagint seem very strange. I have already mentioned
that the Greek word komet means "the long-haired one," or a star with hair, a comet. In Latin,
coma is "hair."
Mazzaroth means a comet, wrote an exegete, and therefore, he argued, it cannot mean Venus.14
But in any case it is said that the Evening Star has hair. Actually, Mazzaroth means Venus and a
hairy star.
Venus ceased to appear in its seasons. What had happened?
Venus Becomes trie Morning Star
Since the latter part of the eighth century before the present era, Venus has followed an orbit
between Mercury and earth, which it has maintained ever since. It became the Morning and
Evening Star. Seen from the earth, it is never removed more than 48 degrees (when at its eastern
and western elongation) or three hours and a few minutes east or west of the sun. The dreaded
comet became a tame planet. It has the most nearly circular orbit among the planets.
The end of the terror which Venus kept alive for eight centuries after the days of the Exodus was
the inspiration for Isaiah when he said: 1
"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the
ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into
heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God."

Septuagint and Vulgate both translate Morning Star or Lucifer. What does it mean, that the
Morning Star was assailing the heavens and rising high, and that it was cut down low to the
horizon, and would weaken no more the nations?
More than a hundred generations of commentators have occupied themselves with this passage,
but have met with failure.
Why, it is also asked, should the beautiful Morning Star, called Lucifer, the Light Bearer, live in
the imagination of peoples as an evil power, a fallen star? What is in this lovely planet that
makes her name an equivalent of Satan, or Seth of the Egyptians, the dark power? In his
confusion, Origen wrote this question to the quoted verses of Isaiah: "Most evidently by these
words is he shown to have fallen from heaven, who formerly was Lucifer, and who used to arise
in the morning. For if, as some think, he was a nature of darkness, how is Lucifer said to have

robin-bobin

existed before? Or how could he arise in the morning, who had in himself nothing of the light?"
2
Lucifer was a feared prodigy in the sky, and its origin, as illuminated in this book, explains how
it came to be regarded as a dark power and a fallen star.
After a great struggle, Venus achieved a circular orbit and a permanent place in the family of
planets. During the perturbations which brought about this metamorphosis, Venus also lost its
cometary tail.
In the valley of the Euphrates, "Venus then gives up her position as a great stellar divinity, equal
with sun and moon, and joins the ranks of the other planets." 3
A comet became a planet.
Venus was born as a comet in the second millennium before the present era. In the middle of that
millennium it twice made contact with the earth and changed its cometary orbit. In the tenth to
eighth centuries of the first millennium, it was still a comet. What caused such further changes in
the motion of Venus in the first millennium that it became a planet on a circular orbit?

CHAPTER 1
Amos
ABOUT seven hundred fifty years passed after the great catastrophe of the days of the Exodus,
or seven centuries after the cosmic disturbance in the days of Joshua. During all this time the
world was afraid of the recurrence of the catastrophe at the end of every jubilee period. Then,
starting about the middle of the eighth century before the present era, a new series of cosmic
upheavals took place at intervals of short duration.
It was the time of the Hebrew prophets whose books are preserved in writing, of Assyrian kings
whose annals are excavated and deciphered, and of Egyptian pharaohs of the Libyan and
Ethiopian dynasties; in short, the catastrophes which we are now about to describe did not take
place in a mist-shrouded past: the period is part of the well authenticated history of the lands of
the eastern Mediterranean. The eighth century also saw the beginning of the nations of Greece
and Rome.
The seers who prophesied in Judea were versed in the lore of heavenly motion; they observed the
ways of the planetary and comet-ary bodies and, like the stargazers of Assyria and Babylonia,
they were aware of future changes.
In the eighth century, in the days of Uzziah, king of Jerusalem, there occurred a devastating
catastrophe called raash or "commotion." 1 Amos, who lived at the time of Uzziah, began to
predict a
1 Raash is translated "earthquake," which is incorrect here; cf. Jeremiah 10 : 22: "a great
commotion [raash] out of the north." "Earthquake" is rendered in the Scriptures by words derived
from the roots road, hul, regoz, hared, palez, ruf, and raash (commotion).
207
208
WORLDS 72V COLLISION
cosmic upheaval before the raash took place, and after the catastrophe, Isaiah, Joel, Hosea, and
Micah insisted unanimously and with great emphasis on the inevitability of another encounter of
the earth with some cosmic body.
The prophecy of Amos was made two years before the raash (1:1). He declared that fire sent by
the Lord would devour Syria, Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia, as well as the far-off
countries, "with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind" (1:14). The land of Israel would not be

robin-bobin

exempted; "great tumult" would be on its mountains, and "great houses shall have an end" (3 :
15). "He will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts" (6 : ll).2
Amos warned those who invited the day of the Lord and waited for it: "Woe unto you that desire
the day of the Lord! To what end is it for you? The day of the Lord is darkness, and not light . . .
even very dark, and no brightness in it" (5 : 18-20).
Amos, the earliest among the prophets of Judah and Israel whose speeches are preserved in
writing,3 reveals the concept of Yahweh in that remote period of history. Yahweh orders the
planets. "He who maketh [ordains] Khima and Khesil,4 and turneth the shadow of death into the
morning, and maketh the day dark with night, and calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth
them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord [Yahweh] is his name: He strengtheneth the spoiled
against the strong" (5 : 8-9).
Amos prophesied: The land "shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned,
as by the flood of Egypt. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that I will
cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day" (8:8-9).
The "flood of Egypt" mentioned by Amos may be a reference to the catastrophe of the day of the
Passage of the Sea; but more proba2 Rsisim, translated as "breaches," is not strong enough; it would be better to say, "smite great
houses into pieces." Hebrew words translated as "breach" in the King James Version are bedek,
bkia, peretz, shever.
3 Some rabbinical authorities regard Hosea as the oldest among the prophets of that time (Hosea,
Amos, Isaiah).
4 The material for the identification of Khima as Saturn and Khesil as Mars will be presented in
a subsequent part of this work.

bly it refers to an event within the memory of the generation to which Amos spoke.
In the reign of Osorkon II of the Libyan Dynasty in Egypt, in the third year, the first month of
the second season, on the twelfth day, according to a damaged inscription," the flood came on, in
this whole land . . . this land was in its power like the sea; there was no dyke of the people to
withstand its fury. All the people were like birds upon it . . . the tempest . . . suspended . . . like
the heavens. All the temples of Thebes were like marshes." 5
That it was not a seasonal inundation of the Nile is clear from the date. "This calendar date for
the high level of inundation does not at all correspond to the place of the calendar in the
seasons." 8
On the day of the approaching catastrophe, Amos says, there will be no place of escape, not even
on Mount Carmel, rich in caves. "Though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them
down. And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out
thence" (9 : 2-3).
Earth will melt and the sea will be heaped up and thrown upon inhabited land. "And the Lord
God of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt. . . . He that calleth for the waters of
the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth" (9 : 5-6).
Amos was persecuted and killed. The catastrophe did not fail to come at the appointed time. In
anticipation and in fear of it, King Uzziah went to the Temple to burn incense.7 The priests
opposed his appropriating their functions. "Suddenly the earth started to quake so violently that a
great breach was torn in the Temple. On the west side of Jerusalem, half of a mountain was split
off and hurled to the east."8 Flaming seraphim leaped in the air.9
Earthquakes act suddenly, and the population has no means of knowing about them in advance in
order to flee. But before the raash

of Uzziah the population escaped from the cities and fled into caves and clefts between the rocks.
Many generations later, in the post-Exilic period, it was remembered how the population "fled
from before the raash in the days of Uzziah king of Judah." 10
The Year -747
If the commotion of the days of Uzziah was of global character and was brought about by an
extraterrestrial agent, it must have caused some disturbance in the motion of the earth on its axis
and along its orbit. Such a disturbance would have made the old calendar obsolete and would
have required the introduction of a new calendar.
In —747 a new calendar was introduced in the Middle East, and that year is known as "the
beginning of the era of Nabonassar." It is asserted that some astronomical event gave birth to this
new calendar, but the nature of the event is not known. The beginning of the era of Nabonassar,
otherwise an obscure Babylonian king, was an astronomical date used as late as the second
Christian century by the great mathematician and astronomer of the Alexandrian school,
Ptolemy, and also by other scholars. It was employed as a point of departure of ancient
astronomical tables.
"This was not a political or religious era. . . . Farther back there was no certainty in regard to the
calculation of time. It is from that moment that the records of eclipses begin which Ptolemy
used."J What was the astronomical event that closed the previous era and gave birth to a new
era?
According to retrospective calculations, there was no eclipse of the sun in the region of AssyroBabylonia between the years —762 and — 701,2 if the earth has revolved and rotated uniformly
since then, which is taken for granted.

Uzziah reigned from about -789 to about -740.3 The last few years of his reign, beginning with
the day of the "commotion," he spent in seclusion, having been pronounced a leper. It was
apparently the upheaval in the days of Uzziah that separated the two ages. Time was counted
"from the commotion in the days of Uzziah." *
If this conclusion is correct, the upheaval took place in —747. The computation, according to
which the era started on the twenty-sixth day of February, must be re-examined in the light of the
fact that further cosmic disturbances occurred during the decades that followed —747. It is worth
noting, however, that the ancient inhabitants of Mexico celebrated their New Year on the day
which corresponds, in the Julian calendar, to the same date: "The first day of their yeere was the
sixe and twentie day of February." 5
The chronographer and Byzantine monk, Georgius Syncellus, one of the chief sources of ancient
chronology, synchronized the forty-eighth year of Uzziah and the first year of the first
Olympiad.6 But according to modern calculations, the first year of the first Olympiad was —
776.7 The Olympiads most probably were inaugurated by some cosmic event. The text of the
ancient Chinese book of Shiking refers to some celestial phenomenon in the days of the king
Yen-Yang, in —776: the sun was obscured.8 If the occurrence of —776 was of the same nature
as that of —747, then Amos' prophecy was a prognostication based on an earlier experience.

Isaiah
According to Hebrew sources,1 Isaiah began to prophesy immediately after the "commotion" of
the days of Uzziah, even on the same day. The destruction in the land was very great. "Your
country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire. . . . Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us
a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto
Gomorrah" (1 : 7 ff.). The very horizon of Jerusalem was disfigured by the splitting of the
mountain on the west; and the cities were filled with debris and mutilated bodies. "The hills did
tremble, and . . . carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets" (5 : 25).
This was the event that kindled in Isaiah the prophetic spirit. During his long life—he prophesied
in "the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah"—he did not cease to
foretell the return of the catastrophes. Isaiah was skilled in the observation of the stars, and he
apparently knew that at periodic intervals—every fifteen years—a catastrophe occurred, caused,
he believed, by the messenger of God. "His anger is not turned away, but his hand [sign 2] is
stretched out still. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar" (5:25-26).
Isaiah drew an apocalyptic picture of swiftly moving hostile troops. Was he prophesying a cruel
and mighty people of warriors, or a host of missiles hurled from afar when he spoke of the army
that would come swiftly from the end of the world, called by the Lord? Their horses' hoofs
would be like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind. "If one look unto the land, behold darkness
and sorrow; and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof" (5 : 30).
It is not the Assyrians on horses and in chariots that are compared to the flint and the whirlwind,
but the flint and the whirlwind that are likened to warriors.3 The darkness at the end of the
picture discloses that which is the object of comparison and that to which it is compared.

The catastrophe of the days of Uzziah was only a prelude: the day of wrath will return and will
destroy the population "until the cities be wasted without inhabitant" (6 : 11). "Enter into the
rock, and hide thee in the dust" (2 : 10)—all over the world caves in the rocks were regarded as
the best places of refuge. "And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the
earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the
earth" (2 : 19).
Isaiah appeared before King Ahaz and offered him a sign, on the earth or "in the height above."
Ahaz refused: "I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord" (7 : 12).
Then Isaiah faced the people. "And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
darkness, dimness of anguish" (8 : 22). Nevertheless, he said, the dimness will not be as great as
on two former occasions when "at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of
Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in
Galilee of the nations" (9:1). He calculated that the next catastrophe would cause less harm than
had been caused on previous occasions. But soon thereafter he changed his prognostication and
became utterly pessimistic.
"Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel
of the fire" (9 : 19). His rod will lift the sea up "after the manner of Egypt," as on the day of the
crossing of the Red Sea (10 : 26). "And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand [sign] over the river, and shall smite it in
the seven streams" (11 : 15). Nor will Palestine be spared. "He shall shake his hand [sign] against
. . . the hill of Jerusalem" (10 : 32).

Thus, a war of the heavenly host, commanded by the Lord, was proclaimed against the nations of
the earth. And the nations of the earth were aroused by the expectation of Doomsday. "The noise
of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of
nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle" (13 : 4). This
multitude comes

"from the end of heaven, even the Lord, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole
land" (13 : 5).
The world will be darkened. "The stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give
their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth [in the forenoon], and the moon shall not
cause her light to shine" (13 : 10).
The world will be thrown off its axis: the heavenly host "will shake the heavens, and the earth
shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce
anger" (13 : 13).
The nations "shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind" (17 : 13).
Isaiah, on his vigils, watched the firmament, and in "appointed times" expected "from the north a
smoke" (14 : 31).
"All ye inhabitants of the world . . . see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and
when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye" (18 : 3). The eyes of all "dwellers of the earth" were
directed toward the sky, and they listened to the bowels of the earth.
Inquiries were sent to Jerusalem from Seir in Arabia: "Watchman, what of the night?" From his
watchtower ("Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower") Isaiah gave his forecasts to inquirers
(21:5; 21:11).
Nervous tension grew with the approach of the "appointed time," and a rumor sufficed to drive
the population of the cities to the housetops. "What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up
to the housetops?" (22 : 1).
Much of the city of David was damaged and many structures had fissures from almost
continuous earth tremors (22 : 9). The seer frightened the population with his constant warnings
of "a day of trouble . . . and of perplexity by the Lord God of hosts," with "breaking down the
walls, and of crying to the mountains" (22 : 5). But many among the population took the attitude
of those who before Doomsday say: "Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we shall die" (22: 13).

Joel, who prophesied at the same time, also spoke of "wonders in the heavens and in the earth,
blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come" (Joel 2 : 30-31).
Micah, another seer "in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah," warned that
the day was close when "the mountains shall be molten . . . and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax
before the fire" (Micah 1:4). "Marvelous things" will be shown, as in the days when Israel left
Egypt: "The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might . . . their ears shall be deaf . . .
they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth" (7 : 15-17).
Joel, Micah, and Amos warned in similar terms of "a day of thick darkness" and "the day dark
with night." Astronomers, who thought that all this refers to a common eclipse of the sun,
wondered: "From —763 down to the destruction of the First Temple in —586 no total eclipse of
the sun was visible in Palestine." * They took it for granted that the earth revolves along exactly
the same orbit and on a slowly rotating axis, and so they questioned: Why did the prophets speak
of eclipses when there were none? However, other descriptions of the world catastrophe in these
prophets do not accord with the effects of an ordinary eclipse, either.
The word shaog, used by Amos and Joel, is explained by the Talmud5 as an earthshock, the field
of action of which is the entire world, whereas a regular earthquake is of local character. Such a
shaking of the earth, disturbed in its rotation, is visualized also as a "shaking of the sky," an
expression found in the Prophets, in Babylonian texts, and in other literary sources.

are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is
clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly" (24 : 17-19).
The catastrophe came on the day on which King Ahaz was buried. There was a "commotion":
the terrestrial axis shifted or was tilted, and the sunset was hastened by several hours. This
cosmic disturbance is described in the Talmud, in the Midrashim, and referred to by the Fathers
of the Church.' It is related also in the records and told in the traditions of many peoples. It
appears that a heavenly body passed very close to the earth, moving, as it seems, in the same
direction as the earth on its nocturnal side.
"Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down. . . .
The inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left" (Isaiah 24 : 1, 6).
The Argive Tyrants
In Ages in Chaos I shall present proof that the large, raw stone structures of Mycenae and Tiryns
on the Argive plain in Greece are the ruins of the palaces of the Argive tyrants, well remembered
by the Greeks of subsequent centuries, and date from the eighth century before the present era. If
the material remains of the palaces of Mycenae and Tiryns are ascribed to the second
millennium, then nothing has been found on the Argive plain that can be ascribed to the Argive
tyrants, although they are known to have built spacious palaces.
Thyestes and his brother Atreus were of these Argive tyrants. Living in the eighth century, they
must have witnessed the cosmic catastrophes of the days of Isaiah. Greek tradition persists that a
cosmic catastrophe occurred in the time of these tyrants: the sun changed its course and the night
arrived before its proper time.

night, hiding the light of the dazzling sun; and sore fear came upon men. 1
Many classical authors referred to the occurrence. I give here Seneca's description. In his drama,
Thyestes, the chorus asks the sun:
"Whither, O father of the lands and skies, before whose rising thick night with all her glories
flees, whither dost turn thy course and why dost blot out the day in mid-Olympus [midday]? Not
yet does Vesper, twilight's messenger, summon the fires of night; not yet does thy wheel, turning
its western goal, bid free thy steeds from their completed task; not yet as day fades into night has
the third trump sounded; the ploughman with oxen yet unwearied stands amazed at his supper
hour's quick coming. What has driven thee from thy heavenly course? . . . Has Typhoeus
[Typhon] thrown off the mountainous mass and set his body free?" 2
This picture reminds us of the description of the day of Ahaz' burial.
Seneca relates the fear of world destruction experienced by those who lived at the time of Atreus
and Thyestes, the tyrants of the Argive plain. The hearts of men were oppressed with terror at the
sight of the untimely sunset. "The shadows arise, though the night is not yet ready. No stars
come out; the heavens gleam not with any fires: no moon dispels the darkness' heavy pall. . . .
Trembling, trembling are our hearts, sore smit with fear, lest all things fall shattered in fatal ruin
and once more gods and men be overwhelmed by formless chaos; lest the lands, the encircling
sea, and the stars that wander in the spangled sky, nature blot out once more."

Will the seasons be ended and the moon carried away? "No more" shall the stars "mark off the
summer and the winter times; no more shall Luna, reflecting Phoebus' rays, dispel night's
terrors."
After the catastrophe of the days of Atreus and Thyestes, the luminaries crossed their former
paths obliquely; the poles were shifted; the year lengthened—the orbit of the earth became
wider. "The Zodiac, which, making passage through the sacred stars, crosses

the zones obliquely, guide and sign-bearer for the slow moving years, falling itself, shall see the

Seneca describes the change in position of each constellation—the Ram, the Bull, the Twins, the
Lion, the Virgin, the Scales, the Scorpion, the Goat, and the Wain (the Great Bear). "And the
Wain, which was never bathed in the sea, shall be plunged beneath the all-engulfing waves." A
commentator who wondered about this description of the position of the Great Bear wrote:
"There was no mythological reason why the Wain—otherwise known as the Great Bear—should
not be bathed in the Ocean." 3 But Seneca said precisely this strange thing: the Great Bear—or
one of its stars—never set beneath the horizon, and thus the polar star was among its stars during
the age that came to its end in the time of the Argive tyrants.
Seneca also says explicitly that the poles were torn up in this cataclysm. The polar axis now is
turned toward one of the stars, the North Star, of the Little Bear.
In the face of the cataclysm, when humanity was overwhelmed with awe, the heartbroken
Thyestes, longing for death, called upon the universe to go down in utter confusion. The picture
was not invented by Seneca: it was familiar because of what had happened in earlier ages.
"O thou, exalted ruler of the sky, who sittest in majesty upon the throne of heaven, enwrap the
whole universe in awful clouds, set the winds warring on every hand, and from every quarter of
the sky let the loud thunder roll; not with what hand thou seekest houses and undeserving homes,
using thy lesser bolts, but with that hand by which the threefold mass of mountains fell . . . these
arms let loose and hurl thy fires."

Time passed after the death of Ahaz, and the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah approached.
Again the frightened world anxiously anticipated a catastrophe. On its two previous approaches,
the celestial missile had come very close, indeed. This time the end of the

world was feared. After the cataclysms of the days of Uzziah and of the funeral day of Ahaz, one
did not have to be a prophet to foretell a new cosmic catastrophe. The earth will move out of its
place, a scorching flame will devour the air, hot stones will fall from the sky, and the waters of
the sea will mount and descend upon the continents.
"Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest [cataract] of hail and a
destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the
hand" (Isaiah 28 : 2).
"The mighty and strong one" was a heavenly body, a missile of the Lord. Once more it was
destined to scourge the earth. "The overflowing scourge shall pass through" (28 : 18), was
Isaiah's new prognostication. Although the people of Jerusalem hoped that "when the
overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us" (28 : 15), Jerusalem had no
covenant with death.1
There will be no safe place of refuge. "The waters shall overflow the hiding place" (28 : 17). "A
consumption even determined upon the whole earth" (28 : 22).
"For the Lord . . , shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange
work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act" (28 : 21).

robin-bobin

What was the "strange act" in the valley of Gibeon? In that valley the host of Joshua witnessed a
rain of bolides and saw the sun and the moon disturbed in their movement across the firmament.
"At an instant suddenly" the land will be invaded with "small dust" and with "the multitude of
terrible ones," and it will be visited "with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with
storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire" (29 : 5-6).
"A devouring fire" and "an overflowing stream" shall "sift the nations" with "tempest and
hailstones" (30 : 27-30).
The prophet, reading the signs of the sky, took upon himself the role of sentinel of the universe,
and from his watchtower in Jerusalem he spread the alarm:

help her."

"Let the earth hear. . . . For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations . . . He hath delivered
them to the slaughter" (34 : 1 ff.).
Then follows the desolate picture of the destroyed earth and dissolved sky (34: 4 ft):
And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved,
and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll:
and all their host shall fall down. . . .
For my sword shall be bathed in heaven. . . .
And the streams . . . shall be turned into pitch,
and the dust into brimstone,
and the land shall become burning pitch.
It shall not be quenched night nor day;
the smoke shall go up for ever.
Isaiah referred his readers to the "Book of the Lord": "Seek ye out of the book of the Lord, and
read: no one of these shall fail" (34 : 16). This book probably belonged to the same series as the
Book of Jasher, in which the records of the days of Joshua at Gibeon were preserved; old
traditions and astronomical observations must have been written down in the Book of the Lord,
no longer extant.

Here, before I go on to the description of the day on which the prophecies of Isaiah, pronounced
after the death of Ahaz, were fulfilled, I should like to present the common view of generations
of commentators. The books of the Mayas have come into the hands of only a few scholars;
likewise the papyri of Egypt and the clay

221
tablets of the Assyrians. But the Book of Isaiah and other books of the Scriptures have been read
by millions during many centuries in hundreds of languages. Is the way in which Isaiah
expressed himself obscure? It is a kind of collective psychological blind spot which prevents the
understanding of the clearly revealed and scores-of-times-repeated description of astronomical,
geological, and meteorological phenomena. The description was thought to be a peculiar kind of
poetic metaphor, a flowery manner of expression.
Even a modest attempt to review the various commentaries on Isaiah would burst the frame of a
book larger than this one. Therefore it should satisfy the orthodox and the liberal reader alike if
the opinions presented by two great authorities in the world of thought are given here, and the
thousands of commentators not quoted at all.

Moses ben Maimon, called Rambam, also Maimonides (1135-1204), in his The Guide for the
Perplexed,1 expressed the opinion that a belief in the Creation is a fundamental principle of
Jewish religion, "but we do not consider it a principle of our faith that the Universe will again be
reduced to nothing"; "it depends on His will," and "it is therefore possible that He will preserve
the Universe for ever"; "the belief in the destruction is not necessarily implied in the belief in the
Creation." "We agree with Aristotle in one half of his theory. . . . The opinion of Aristotle is that
the Universe being permanent and indestructible, is also eternal and without beginning."
With this theophilosophic approach to the problem at large, Maimonides was averse to finding
any word or sentence in the Prophets or elsewhere in the Bible that would suggest a destruction
of the world or even a change in its order.2 Each and every such expression he explained as a
poetical substitute for an exposition of political ideas and acts.
Maimonides says: " 'The stars have fallen,' 'The heavens are overthrown,' 'The sun is darkened,'
'The earth is waste and trembles,'
1 English translation by M. Friedlander (1928).
2 Maimonides apparently follows Philo, the Greek-writing Jewish philosopher of the first
century, who in his The Eternity of the World was of the opinion that the world was created but
that it is indestructible; however, Philo admitted changes in nature caused by periodic floods and
conflagrations on a large scale and of cosmic origin.

and similar metaphors" are "frequently employed by Isaiah, and less frequently by other
prophets, when they describe the ruin of a kingdom." In these phrases the term "mankind" is
used occasionally; this is also a metaphor, says Maimonides. "Sometimes the prophets use the
term 'mankind' instead of 'the people of a certain place,' whose destruction they predict; e.g.,
Isaiah, speaking of the destruction of Israel, says: 'And the Lord will remove man far away' (6 :
12). So also Zephaniah (1 : 3-4), 'And I will cut off man from off the earth.'"
He maintains that Isaiah and other seers of Israel, when examined by the realistic method of
Aristotelianism, were persons inclined to exaggerated forms of speech, and instead of saying,
"Babylon will fall," or "fell," they spoke in terms of some fantastic perturbation in the cosmos
above and beneath.
"When Isaiah received the divine mission to prophesy the destruction of the Babylonian empire,
the death of Sennacherib and that of Nebuchadnezzar, who rose after the overthrow of
Sennacherib,3 he commences in the following manner to describe their fall . . . : 'For the stars of
heaven and the constellations thereof, shall not give their light' (13 : 10); again, 'Therefore I will
shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts,
and in the day of his fierce anger' (13 : 13). I do not think that any person is so foolish and blind,
and so much in favour of the literal sense of figurative and oratorical phrases, as to assume that
at the fall of the Babylonian kingdom a change took place in the nature of the stars of heaven, or
in the light of the sun and moon, or that the earth moved away from its center. For all this is
merely the description of a country that has been defeated; the inhabitants undoubtedly find all
light dark, and all sweet things bitter: the whole earth appears too narrow for them, and the
heavens are changed in their eyes."
"He speaks in a similar manner when he describes . . . the loss of the entire land of Israel when it
came into the possession of Sennacherib. He says (24 : 18-20): '. . . for the windows from on
high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. The earth is

utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall
reel to and fro like a drunkard.'"
The subjugation of Judah by Assyria was joyless, but what was so bad, from Isaiah's point of
view, in the destruction of Babylon that the stars should not give their light?
A reading of the literature indicates that no exegete has ever been "so foolish and blind" as to
read sky for sky, stars for stars, brimstone for brimstone, fire for fire, blast for blast.4 Referring

robin-bobin

to the quoted verses—Isaiah 34 : 4-5—Maimonides writes: "Will any person who has eyes to see
find in these verses any expression that is obscure, or that might lead him to think that they
contain an account of what will befall the heavens? . . . The prophet means to say that the
individuals, who were like stars as regards their permanent, high, and undisturbed position, will
quickly come down."
Maimonides quotes Ezekiel, Joel, Amos, Micah, Haggai, Habak-kuk, and Psalms, and in verses
similar to those cited from Isaiah, he finds incidentally a description of "a multitude of locusts,"
or a speech appropriate for the destruction of Samaria or the "destruction of Medes and
Persians," spoken "in metaphors which are intelligible to those who understand the context."
In a settled world nothing alters the given order. To sustain this doctrine, the prophecies were
translated into metaphors, for, in the opinion of Maimonides, if the world does not change its
regimented harmony, true prophets would not declare that it does. "Our opinion, in support of
which we have quoted these passages," writes Maimonides, "is clearly established, namely, that
no prophet or sage has ever announced the destruction of the Universe, or a change of its present
condition, or a permanent change of any of its properties." This standpoint of Maimonides, as far
as a change of conditions in the Universe is concerned, is a deduction, not from the texts he
interprets, but from a philosophical a priori approach. Prophets might err
4 But for what they were taken may be illustrated by the exegesis of Augustine. He writes: "Hail
and coals of fire (Psalm 18): Reproofs are figured, whereby as by hail, the hard hearts are
bruised." To the words, "And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them (Psalm 15)," Augustine
writes: "And He sent out Evangelists traversing straight paths on the wines of strength." St.
Augustine, Expositions on the Book of Psalms, ed. Ph. Schaff (1905).

in their prophecies, but it could hardly be that in saying "stars" they meant "persons." The
reading of subsequent chapters in Isaiah (36-39) and parallel chapters in Kings and Chronicles,
as well as the Talmudic and Midrashic fragments (concerning the time of Sennacherib's
invasion), makes it apparent that this time the prophets did not err, and that a change in
harmonious conditions did occur in the lifetime of these very prophets, in the days of Hezekiah.
Maimonides asserts that Joel's prophecies referred to Sennacherib, but he is puzzled: "You may
perhaps object—how can the day of the fall of Sennacherib, according to our explanation, be
called 'the great and the terrible day of the Lord'?"
In the following pages it will be shown that on the very day which preceded the night when
Sennacherib's army was destroyed, the order of nature was upset. The speeches of the seers must
be interpreted not apart from, but in the light of, the description of these changes as they are
preserved in the Scriptures and in the Talmud. There was keener insight during the times prior to
Maimonides, and to these more ancient interpreters he referred when he wrote:
"The Universe [ever] since continues its regular course. This is my opinion; this should be our
belief. Our Sages, however, said very strange things as regards miracles; they are found in
Bereshith Rabba, and in Midrash Koheleth, namely, that the miracles are to some extent also
natural."
Baruch Spinoza proceeds from the premise that "Nature always observes laws and rules . . .
although they may not all be known to us, and therefore she keeps a fixed and immutable order."
"Miracles" merely mean events of which the natural cause cannot be explained. "In so far as a
miracle is supposed to destroy or interrupt the order of Nature or her laws, it not only gives us no
knowledge of God, but, contrariwise . . . makes us doubt of God and everything else." "What is
meant in Scripture by a miracle can only be a work of Nature."5
All these premises are philosophically true and no objection can be

Ratner in his The Philosophy of Spinoza.

225
raised against them. Of course, they are true only as long as the philosopher does not insist that
the laws of nature as known to him are the real and only laws.

robin-bobin

Discussing instances in the Scriptures to which the quoted principles should be applied, Spinoza
insists that the subjective apperception and the peculiar manner of expression of the ancient
Hebrews are the only reasons for the accounts of unnatural events.
"I will content myself with one instance from Scripture, and leave the reader to judge of the rest.
In the time of Joshua the Hebrews held the ordinary opinion that the sun moves with a daily
motion, and that the earth remains at rest; to this preconceived opinion they adapted the miracle
which occurred during their battle with the five kings. They did not simply relate that the day
was longer than usual, but asserted that the sun and moon stood still, or ceased from their
motion."
The deduction made is: "Partly through religious motives, partly through preconceived opinions,
they conceived of and related the occurrence as something quite different from what really
happened." "It is necessary to know the opinions of those who first related them . . . and to
distinguish such opinions from the actual impression made upon our senses, otherwise we shall
confound opinions and judgments with the actual miracle as it really occurred; nay, further, we
shall confound actual events with symbolical and imaginary ones."
The Book of Isaiah is offered by Spinoza as another example, and the chapter on Babylon's
doomed destruction is quoted: "The stars of heaven . . . shall not give their light; the sun shall be
darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine." The philosopher
writes: "Now I suppose no one imagines that at the destruction of Babylon these phenomena
actually occurred any more than that which the prophet adds: 'For I will make the heavens to
tremble, and remove the earth out of her place.'" "Many occurrences in the Bible are to be
regarded as Jewish expressions." "The Scripture narrates in order and style which has most
power to move men and especially uneducated men . . . and therefore it speaks inaccurately of
God and of events."
Asserting a subjective apperception on the part of the witnesses,
226
WORLDS IN COLLISION
a deliberate intention to impress the reader or listener with exciting descriptions, a peculiarity in
the mode of expression of Hebrew penmen, Spinoza nevertheless arrives at a non sequitur: "Now
all these texts teach most distinctly that Nature preserves a fixed and unchangeable order. . . .
Nowhere does Scripture assert that anything happens which contradicts, or cannot follow from
the laws of Nature," and he supports his view with a theological argument: in the Book of
Ecclesiastes it is written: "I know what God does, it shall be for ever."
The events were called miracles and were explained as subjective apperceptions or as symbolic
descriptions because they could not be otherwise accounted for. But apart from the events
themselves, which this study endeavors to establish as historical, the words of Isaiah and of other
seers and penmen of the Old Testament do not leave any room for doubt that by "stones falling
from the sky" were meant meteorites; by brimstone and pitch were meant brimstone and pitch;
by scorching blast of fire was meant scorching blast of fire; by storm and tempest, storm and
tempest; by a darkened sun, by the earth removed from its place, by change of time and seasons,
were meant just these changes in the regular processes of nature. Where is the basis for the "sure
knowledge" that the earth must move without perturbation at a time when every body in the solar
system more or less perturbs every other one? Until the fall of meteorites in 1803, science was
sure that stones falling from the sky occurred only in legends.
The "no one imagines" of Spinoza is no longer true. The author of this book does so imagine.
CHAPTER 2
The Year -687
IN ABOUT —722, after three years of siege, Samaria, the capital of the Ten Tribes, was
captured by Sargon II, and the population of the Northern Kingdom, or Israel, was removed into
captivity from which it never returned.
In about —701, Sennacherib, son of Sargon, undertook the third campaign of his reign; he
directed it to the south, into Palestine. The record of this and other campaigns of his is written

robin-bobin

and preserved in cuneiform signs worked on the sides of prisms of baked clay. The so-called
"Taylor prism" contains the narrative of eight campaigns of Sennacherib. He wrote about his
road to victory: "The wheels of my war chariot were bespattered with filth and blood."
The record of the third campaign on the prism corresponds to the record preserved in II Kings 18
: 13-16. According to both sources, Sennacherib took many cities; "the proud Hezekiah, the
Judean," was "closed like a bird in a cage" in his capital, Jerusalem, but Sennacherib did not
capture Jerusalem; he satisfied himself with a tribute of gold and silverx sent to him at Lachish in
southern Palestine. After that he departed with his booty.
Hezekiah had no choice but to submit; the defenses of the land were inadequate. Now he used
the time, which he recognized as only a respite, to build walled strongholds and to garrison them,
and to prepare the brooks and the wells of the land to be stopped and destroyed at the first signal.
This is described in II Chronicles (32 : 1-6).

talents of silver according to the prism.

Sennacherib, alarmed by the revolt of Hezekiah, who aligned himself with the king of Ethiopia
and Egypt, Tirhakah, came again with his army and once more set up his headquarters near
Lachish. One of Sennacherib's generals, Rab-sha-keh, came to Jerusalem and spoke with the
emissaries of Hezekiah, loudly and in Hebrew, so that the warriors on the wall could hear him,
too (Isaiah 36 : 18 ff.): "Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The Lord will deliver us.
Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?" He
also told them to consider the fate of Samaria, whose gods did not save it when it was stormed
by the Assyrians. He informed them that Sennacherib required pledges of submission and
promised that they would be exiled to a land as good as their own. Hezekiah's emissaries were
ordered not to enter into any dispute. Receiving no reply, Rab-sha-keh departed for Libna where
King Sennacherib had gone from Lachish. The Ethiopian king Tirhakah came against
Sennacherib out of the borders of Egypt and prepared to meet him in battle. Rab-sha-keh sent
again a demand to Hezekiah to submit: "Let not thy God deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall
not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
It was the prophecy of Isaiah that Jerusalem would not fall into the hands of the king of Assyria
and that the king who blasphemed the Lord would be destroyed by "a blast" sent by the Lord.
The story is described in detail three times in the Scriptures—in II Kings 18-20, II Chronicles 32,
and Isaiah, Chapters 36-38. The first version alone contains the first part of the story about
Sennacherib, who conquered all the fenced cities of Judah, and Hezekiah, king of Judah, who
submitted to the Assyrian king and paid tribute to him. All three scriptural sources tell about
Hezekiah's rebelling against Sennacherib and refusing to submit or to pay tribute. It is obvious
that, despite the repeated mention of Lachish, there must have been two different campaigns: in
the first, Hezekiah submitted and agreed to pay tribute; the second campaign was a number of
years later. In the meantime, Hezekiah had built up "all the wall that was broken, and raised it up
to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Milo in the city of David, and made darts
and shields in abundance. And he set captains of war over the peoWORLDS IN COLLISION
229
pie. And when Sennacherib came and entered Judah, Hezekiah ordered to stop all the fountains
without Jerusalem, and spoke to the people in the city to be strong and courageous." And then
came the miraculous destruction of the Assyrian host.
The annals of Sennacherib tell only the first part of the story: the capture of the cities of the land,
the submission of Hezekiah, and the tribute he paid. The siege of Lachish is not mentioned on
the prism, but an Assyrian relief of this siege is preserved. Nothing is told in the Assyrian
sources about defeat in Judea, and only the epilogue, the killing of Sennacherib by his own sons,
is described identically in the Scriptures and in a cuneiform inscription of Esarhaddon, son of
Sennacherib.

robin-bobin

The destruction of Sennacherib's army having taken place in a later—evidently the last—
campaign of Sennacherib before his assassination, it was not inserted on the eight-campaign
prism; this must have been his ninth, or possibly his tenth, campaign. Its disastrous outcome
would not have inspired the king to order a new prism which should include this campaign, too.
In the last century it was realized that the first part of the story in the Book of Kings is the
counterpart of the record on the prism, and that the second part of the story in the Book of Kings,
as well as the whole story in Chronicles and in the Book of Isaiah, is a separate record of a
separate campaign in Palestine.2
2 H. Rawlinson was the first to assume two campaigns of Sennacherib against Palestine. G.
Rawlinson was of the same opinion. The Taylor Cylinder covers the time down to the 20th of
Adar —691. H. Winckler supported this view with the argument that Tirhakah the Ethiopian
became king of Ethiopia and Egypt after —691: "It can signify only a new campaign of
Sennacherib which must have taken place after the destruction of Babylon (689 b. c. ) and of
which we have no record by Sennacherib himself."
The reference, "in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah," in the beginning of the record in the Book of
Kings, explains why the obvious fact that there were two campaigns escaped earlier
commentators. Also, the mention of Lachish in both campaigns was a stumbling block. In this
connection K. Fullerton remarked ("The Invasion of Sennacherib" in Biblioteca Sacra, 1906) that
Richard Cceur de Lion also made Lachish a base of operations on two different crusades.
Modern historians support the view that Tirhakah did not become king before -689.

The first campaign against Judah took place in —702 or —701. The date of the second campaign
is established as —687, or less probably, -686.
"Of the remaining eight years of his reign [after the conclusion of the prism records] we have no
information from his own annals, which now cease. Sennacherib once more arrived in the West
(687 or 686?)."3
Ignis e Coelo
The destruction of the army of Sennacherib is described laconically in the Book of Kings: "And
it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the
Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when the people arose early in the
morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went
and returned, and dwelt in Nineveh." It is similarly described in the Book of Chronicles: "And
the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. And the Lord sent an angel
which cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of
Assyria. So he [Sennacherib] returned with shame of face to his own land."
What kind of destruction was this? Malach, translated as "angel," means in Hebrew "one who is
sent to execute an order," supposed to be an order of the Lord. It is explained in the texts of the
Books of Kings and Isaiah that it was a "blast" sent upon the army of Sennacherib.1 "I will send
a blast upon him . . . and [he] shall return to his own land," was the prophecy immediately
preceding the catastrophe. The simultaneous death of tens of thousands of warriors could not be
due to a plague, as it is usually supposed, because a plague does not strike so suddenly; it
develops through contagion, if rapidly, in a few days, and may infect a large camp, but it does

affect great multitudes without showing a curve of cases mounting from day to day.

robin-bobin

The Talmud and Midrash sources, which are numerous, all agree on the manner in which the
Assyrian host was destroyed: a blast fell from the sky on the camp of Sennacherib. It was not a
flame, but a consuming blast: "Their souls were burnt, though their garments remained intact."
The phenomenon was accompanied by a terrific noise.2
Arad ftbil is the Babylonian designation of ignis e coelo (fire from the sky).3
Another version of the destruction of the army of Sennacherib is given by Herodotus. During his
visit in Egypt, he heard from the Egyptian priests or guides to the antiquities that the army of
Sennacherib, while threatening the borders of Egypt, was destroyed in a single night. According
to this story, an image of a deity holding in his palm the figure of a mouse was erected in an
Egyptian temple to commemorate the miraculous event. In explanation of the symbolic figure,
Herodotus was told that myriads of mice descended upon the Assyrian camp and gnawed away
the cords of their bows and other weapons; deprived of their arms, the troops fled in panic.
Josephus Flavius repeated the version of Herodotus, and added that there is another version by
the Chaldeo-Hellenistic historian Berosus. Josephus wrote introductory words to a quotation of
Bero-sus, but the quotation itself is missing in the present text of the Jewish Antiquities.
Obviously, it was an explanation different from that of Herodotus. Josephus' own account,
somewhat rationalistic as usual, says a (bubonic) plague was the cause of the sudden death of
one hundred and eighty-five thousand warriors in the camp of the Assyrians before the walls of
Jerusalem on the very first night of the siege.
Herodotus recounts that he saw the statue of the god with a mouse in the palm of his hand, which
was erected in memory of the event.

Two cities in Egypt claimed the same sacred animal, the shrew-mouse: Panopolis (Akhmim) in
the south and Letopolis in the north. Herodotus did not travel to the south of Egypt; thus, he must
have seen the statue in Letopolis. Even today many bronze mice, sometimes inscribed with the
prayers of pilgrims, are found in the ground of Letopolis.
Both cities with the cult of the sacred mouse were "sacred cities of thunderbolt and meteorites."
* The Egyptian name for Letopolis is indicated by the same hieroglyphic as "thunderbolt."
In a text dating from the New Kingdom and originating in Letopolis, it is said that a festival was
established in this city in memory of "the night of fire for the adversaries." This fire was like "the
flame before the wind to the end of heaven and the end of earth." ' "I come forth and go in the
devouring fire on the day of the repelling of the adversaries," says the text in the name of the
god. Thus tha god with the sacred mouse was a god of devouring fire.
However, interpreting the mouse as a symbol of bubonic plague,* the commentators agreed with
Josephus that Sennacherib's army must have been destroyed by a plague.
It is peculiar that the numerous commentators of Herodotus and the no less numerous
commentators of the Bible did not draw attention to a certain coincidence in these descriptions of
the calamity. Hezekiah became gravely ill of some bubonic affection and was near death. Isaiah
was called. He told the king that he would die, but soon he returned and offered a remedy—a
lump of figs for the boil —and told the king that the Lord would deliver him from immediate
death and would also deliver "this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria."

was gone down." 7
An optical illusion is the common explanation of the meaning of this passage.8 The sundial
mentioned together with the name of Ahaz is supposed to have been a dial built by Ahaz, father
of Heze-kiah. But the Talmudic tradition explains that the day was shortened by ten degrees on
the day when Ahaz was buried, and the day was prolonged by ten degrees when Hezekiah was ill
and recovered, and this is the meaning of the "shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the
sun dial of Ahaz." 9
The rabbinical sources state in a definite manner that the disturbance in the movement of the sun
happened on the evening of the destruction of Sennacherib's army by a devouring blast.10
Returning to Herodotus, we shall give our attention to the following important fact neglected by
the commentators. The famous paragraph of Herodotus which records, in the name of the
Egyptian priests, that since Egypt became a kingdom, the sun had repeatedly changed its
direction, is inserted in no other place of Herodotus' history, but directly following the story of
the destruction of Sennacherib's army.
The destruction of Sennacherib's army and the disturbance in the movement of the sun are also
described in two subsequent passages of the Scriptures. Now the two records seem to be in better
accord.

March 23rd
It was apparently some cosmic cause that was responsible for the sudden destruction of the army
of Sennacherib and brought about the perturbation in the rotating movement of the earth.
Gaseous masses reaching the atmosphere could asphyxiate all breath in certain areas.
This explanation requires supporting statements from other sources; disturbances in the
movement of the sun could not be confined to the sun over Palestine and Egypt. Also, other
circumstances of this catastrophe, like the gaseous masses covering the sky, should have been
noticed in other regions of the earth, too.
First, a more exact date for the night of the annihilation of Sennacherib's army should be
established. From modern research we know that it was in the year —687 (less probably in the
year —686). The Talmud and Midrash give another valuable clue: the destruction occurred
during the first night of Passover. The giant host was destroyed when the people began to sing
the Hallel prayer of the Passover service.1 Passover was observed about the time of the vernal
equinox.2
In the book of Edouard Biot, Catalogue general des etoiles filantes et des autres meteores
observes en Chine apres le VIP siicle avant J.C.,3 the register begins with this statement:
"The year 687 B.C., in the summer, in the fourth moon, in the day sin mao (23rd of March)
during the night, the fixed stars did not appear, though the night was clear [cloudless]. In the
middle of the night stars fell like a rain."
The date, 23rd of March, is Biot's calculation. The statement is based on old Chinese sources
ascribed to Confucius. In another

translation of the text, by Remusat,4 the last part of the passage is rendered as follows: "Though
the night was clear, a star fell in the form of rain" (il tomba une etoile en forme de pluie).
The annals of the Bamboo Books obviously refer to the same event when they inform us that in
the tenth year of the Emperor Kwei (the seventeenth emperor of the Dynasty Yu, or the
eighteenth monarch since Yahou) "the five planets went out of their courses. In the night, stars
fell like rain. The earth shook." 5
The words in the annals, "in the night, stars fell like rain," are the same as in the record of
Confucius dealing with the cosmic event on the 23rd of March, —687. The annals supply the
information that the cause of this phenomenon was a disturbance among the planets. The record
of Confucius is a precious entry, because the time of the phenomenon—the day, the month, and
the year—is given.
The sky was cloudless, so that the stars should have been visible —but they were not, and this
reminds us of the words of the prophets.6
The Biot Catalogue, which begins with this description of the year —687, subsequently notes
only solitary meteors falling from the sky during all the following centuries up to the beginning
of this era; the prodigy of the year —687 was not a pageant such as we may find again in the
Chinese annals of later centuries.
The rare phenomenon occurred in that year and in that part of the year—23rd of March, —687—
when, as explained above, according to modern calculations and the Talmudic data, the
destruction of Sennacherib's army took place. In the Chinese record we have a short but precise
account of the night, which we have recognized as the night of annihilation.
We also expect to find in Chinese sources a record of the disturbance in the movement of the
sun. China is forty-five to ninety degrees longitude east of Palestine, the difference in time being
three to six hours.

Huai-nan-tse,7 who lived in the second century before the present era, tells us that "when the
Duke of Lu-yang was at war against Han, during the battle the sun went down. The Duke,
swinging his spear, beckoned to the sun, whereupon the sun, for his sake, came back and passed
through three solar mansions."
The subjective-mythological part reminds us of the primitive-subjective approach of the author
of the Book of Joshua, and probably also of the contemporaries of Joshua; it is the primitive way
of interpreting natural phenomena. However, it differs from what is described in the Book of
Joshua in that it was not a phenomenon of a long pause by the sun, but of a short retrograde
motion; in this the Chinese description corresponds with the twentieth chapter of II Kings.
The exact date of the reign of Han is not known; it is sometimes supposed, on the basis of
astronomical computation, to have been in the fifth century before this era, or even later.8 If this
is true, then the event described refers to a period before the dynasty of Han became dominant in
China.

The land of China is large; it was divided into many princedoms. Probably the story of Prince
Tau of Yin is another description of the same event in a different part of China. Lu-Heng9
records that Prince Tau of Yin was an involuntary guest of the king of China when the sun
returned to the meridian; it was interpreted as a sign to allow the prince to return home.
The story of the Argive tyrants tells of the sun going speedily to its setting and the evening
coming before its proper time; and we recognized in this the phenomenon described in the
rabbinical sources as having occurred on the day of the burial of Ahaz, father of Hezekiah. The

which may be erroneous.

Lu-yang and Prince Tau of Yin took place at the time of the same tyrants, or was so ascribed.
"Atreus," says Apollodorus,10 "stipulated with Thyestes that Atreus should be king if the sun
should go backward; and when Thyestes agreed, the sun set in the east."
Ovid describes this phenomenon of the days of the Argive tyrants: Phoebus broke off "in midcareer, and wresting his car about turned round his steeds to face the dawn." u Also in Tristia
Ovid refers to this literary tradition12 about "the horses of the sun turning aside."13
A Mayan inscription says that a planet brushed close to the earth.14
Three solar mansions of the Chinese must have been equal to ten degrees on the dial at the
palace in Jerusalem.
According to Talmudic sources,15 an equal perturbation, but in the opposite direction, occurred
on the day Ahaz was carried to his grave: at that time the day was quickened. A case of two
consecutive perturbations of a celestial body, where the second perturbation corrected the effect
of the first, is recorded in the annals of modern observations. In 1875 Wolfs comet passed near
the large planet Jupiter and was disturbed on its way. In 1922, when it again passed near Jupiter,
it was once more disturbed, but with an effect which corrected that of the first disturbance. No
perturbation was noticed in the revolution of Jupiter; its rotation probably proceeded normally,
too—there was a great difference in the masses of these two bodies.

The Worship of Mars
The body which periodically—once in fourteen to sixteen years—approached the orbit of the
earth must have been of considerable mass, for it was able to influence the rotation of the earth.

robin-bobin

Apparently, however, it was much smaller than Venus, or it did not approach so closely, because
the catastrophes of the days of the Exodus and the Conquest were greater than those of the time
of Uzziah, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Nevertheless, for the peoples who lived at that time, they must
have been impressive experiences and must have been incorporated in their cosmogonic
mythologies.
Shall we be able, when inquiring into this matter, to find guiding hints to help us obtain some
data about the body which periodically approached the earth?
It would probably be the Latin people, at that time very young, just appearing on the historical
scene and not loaded down with science, who would give the prodigy a prominent place in their
mythology. Roman mythology was appropriated from the Greeks. Only one god of Roman
mythology plays a role not comparable to that attributed to him on the Greek Olympus. It is the
god Mars, whose counterpart is Ares of the Greeks.1 Mars, the lord of war, was second to
Jupiter-Zeus. He personified the planet Mars, to him was dedicated the month of March (Mars),
and as a god he was supposed to be the father of Romulus, the founder of Rome. He was the
national god of the Romans. Livy wrote in the preface to his history of Rome, "the mightiest of
empires, next after that of Heaven": "The Roman people . . . profess that their Father and the
Father of their Empire was none other than Mars."
Placing the time of Mars' activity as late as the foundation of Rome indicates that the Romans
had a tradition that the city on the Tiber came into existence during a generation which witnessed
some great exploit of their god-planet.
1 Besides Ares, Hercules also represents the planet Mars. Eratosthenes (Era-tosthenis
catasterismorum reliquiae, ed. C. Robert, 1878): "Tertia est Stella Martis quam alii Herculis
dixerunt" (Mars is the third star, which others say is Hercules). Similarly, Macrobius (Saturnalia
iii. 12. 5-6), whose authority is Varro.

The founding of Rome took place close in time to the great perturbations of nature in the days of
Amos and Isaiah. According to the calculation of Fabius Pictor, Rome was founded in the latter
half of the first year of the eighth Olympiad, or the year —747; other Roman authorities differ by
a few years only.2 The year —747 is the beginning of an astronomical era in the Middle East;
and the "commotion of Uzziah" took place, apparently, in the same year.
According to a persistent Roman tradition, the conception of Romulus by his mother, the
foundation of Rome, and the death of Romulus occurred in years of great commotions
accompanied by celestial phenomena and disturbances in solar movement. These changes were
connected in some way with the planet Mars. Plutarch wrote: "To the surname of Quirinus
bestowed on Romulus some give the meaning of Mars." 3 The legend says that Romulus was
conceived in the first year of the second Olympiad (—772) when the sun was totally eclipsed.
According to Latin historians, on the very day of Rome's foundation, the sun was disrupted in its
movement and the world was darkened.4 In Romulus' time "a plague fell upon the land, bringing
sudden death without previous sickness," and "a rain of blood" and other calamities. Earthquakes
convulsed the earth for a long period. Jewish tradition knows that "the first settlers of Rome
found that the huts collapsed as soon as built." 5
The death of Romulus occurred when, according to Plutarch, "suddenly strange and
unaccountable disorders with incredible changes filled the air; the light of the sun failed, and
night came down upon them, not with peace and quiet, but with awful peals of thunder and
furious blasts," and amidst this storm Romulus disappeared.6
2 Polybius dated the foundation of Rome in the second year of the seventh Olympiad (—750);
Porcius Cato, in the first year of the seventh Olympiad (—751); Verrius Flaccus, in the fourth
year of the sixth Olympiad (—752); Terentius Varro, in the third year of the sixth Olympiad (—
753); Censorinus followed Varro.

Ovid's description of the phenomena on the day of Romulus' death is this: "Both the poles shook,
and Atlas shifted the burden of the sky. . . . The sun vanished and rising clouds obscured the
heaven . . . the sky was riven by shooting flames. The people fled and the king [Romulus] upon
his father's [Mars'] steeds soared to the stars." 7
Hezekiah was a contemporary of Romulus and Numa; this was known to Augustine: "Now these
days extend . . . down to Romulus king of Romans, or even to the beginning of the reign of his
successor Numa Pompilius. Hezekiah king of Judah certainly reigned till then." 8
If Mars really was the deified cosmic visitor of the days of Hezekiah and Sennacherib, then one
might expect not only that the activities of Mars would have been ascribed to the generation of
Romulus and the foundation of Rome, but that the very date of the perturbation would have been
a celebrated date in the cult of Mars.
The year of the second campaign of Sennacherib against Palestine is established by modern
research as —687. The Talmud helps to set the time of the year: it was the night of the feast of
spring, Passover. Chinese sources give the exact date, midnight of the 23rd of March, —687, as
the date of a great cosmic activity.
The main festival in the cult of Mars took place in the month dedicated to this god-planet. "The
ancilia, or sacred shields . . . were carried in procession by the Salii, or dancing warrior-priests of
Man on several occasions during the month of March up to the 23rd (tubilustrium), when the
military trumpets (tubae) were lustrated; and again in October to the 19th (armilustrium), when
both the ancilia and the arms of the exercitus were purified and put away for the winter. ... It is
only at the end of February that we find indications of the coming Mars-cult." 9 "The most
important role in the

241
cult of Mars appears to be played by the festival of tubilustrium on the twenty-third day of
March." 10
The date, the 23rd of March, taken with all the other circumstances mentioned above, must
impress us. The fact that Mars had festivals on two dates (the other date, the 19th of October, is
almost a month after the autumnal equinox) is easily understandable if one remembers that there
was more than one perturbation connected with the same cosmic cause.
The disturbance in the movement of the sun a few hours before the Assyrian host perished
occurred on the first day of Passover. The cataclysm of the days of the Exodus was caused by the
planet Venus. Therefore, about the time of the vernal equinox there were two festivals, one for
the planet Mars, the other for the planet Venus, which coincided in time. The festival of Minerva
lasted from the nineteenth to the twenty-third of March, and on March 23rd, Mars, and also
Minerva-Athene, were the honored deities.11
Mars Moves the Earth from Its Pivot
Venus was a comet, and in historical times it became a planet. Was Mars a comet in the eighth
century before this era? There is evidence that long before the eighth century Mars was a planet
in the solar system. A four-planet system was known to Chaldean astronomy, in which Venus
was absent but Mars was present.
There does not exist, at least in the extant material, any mention of the first appearance of Mars,
whereas expressions referring to the birth of the planet Venus have been found in literary sources
of the peoples of both hemispheres.
The Babylonian name of the planet Mars is Nergal.1 This name is referred to in early times,
many centuries prior to the eighth century. But it was in that latter century that this planet

robin-bobin

became a most important deity. Many prayers to it were composed. "Radiant abode, that beams
over the land . . . who is thy equal?" Temples were

built to this planet and statues erected. When Samaria was conquered by Sargon, father of
Sennacherib, and new settlers were brought to live there, they erected in Samaria a shrine to the
planet Mars.2
The planet Mars was feared for its violence. "Nergal, the almighty among the gods, fear, terror,
awe-inspiring splendor," 3 wrote Esar-haddon, son of Sennacherib. Shamash-shum-ukin, king of
Babylonia and grandson of Sennacherib, wrote: "Nergal, the most violent among the gods."
It is characteristic that Nergal was regarded by the people of Assyria as a god who brought
defeat. Another grandson of Sennacherib, Assurbanipal, king of Assyria, wrote: "Nergal, the
perfect warrior, the most powerful one among the gods, the pre-eminent hero, the mighty lord,
king of battle, lord of power and might, lord of the storm, who brings defeat." 4
It is also a conspicuous fact that the name of Nergal became very common as a component of
personal names in the seventh and sixth centuries. Two generals, both by the name of
Nergalsharezer, were among Nebuchadnezzar's marshals; 5 a king by the name of Nergilissar
ruled in Babylon.6 Priests, warriors, traders in cattle, criminals bearing the name of
Nergalsharezer, are familiar figures in the documents of the seventh century.
In the eighth century in Babylonia, the planet Mars was called "the unpredictable planet." 7
Historical inscriptions of the eighth century speak of the oppositions of the star Mars (Nergal).
These together with conjunctions were carefully watched. "The movements of Mars were
extremely important in Babylonian astrology—its rise and setting, its disappearance and return ...
its position in relation to the equator, the change in its illuminating power, its relation to Venus,

Mercury."8 In India, also, "the various phases of the retrograde motion of the planets and
especially of Mars seem to have been objects of great attention."9
Prayers were addressed to Nergal with the lifting of hands toward the star Mars.10 "Thou who
walkest in the sky . . . with splendor and terror . . . king of battle, the raging fire-god, god
Nergal." Nergal-Mars was called by the Babylonians the "fire-star." u Nergal, the fire-star,
comes like a raging storm. He is also called Sharappu, "the burner," and "light that flames from
heaven," and "lord of destruction." 12 Mars was generally regarded by other peoples, too, as a
"fire-star." 13 Ying-Huo, or the fire planet, is the name of Mars in Cninese astronomical
charts.14 Saigon (—724 to —705), father of Sennacherib, wrote on one occasion: "In the month
of Abu, the month of descent of the fire-god."15
But we ask for a direct statement that the planet Mars-Nergal was the immediate cause of the
cataclysms in the eighth and seventh centuries, when the world, in the language of Isaiah, was
"moved exceedingly" and "became removed from its place." This very action is ascribed to the
planet Mars-Nergal: "The heaven he makes dark, he moves the Earth off its hinges." 16 And
again: "Nergal ... on high stills the heavens . . . causes the earth to shudder."1T

CHAPTER 3
What Caused Venus and Mars to Shift Their Orbits?
WHEN VENUS became a new member of the solar system, it moved on a stretched ellipse, and
for centuries imperiled the other planets. Because of its dangerous circling, Venus was diligently
observed in both hemispheres, and records were kept of its movement.
In the last centuries before this era, the 288-day year of Venus, and apparently also its orbit, were
practically the same as in modem times. As early as the second half of the seventh century before
this era, Venus, watched until then with anxiety, had already ceased to be a cause of dreadful
expectation; it probably reached then the orbital stage in which it was found in the last centuries
before this era, and where we still find it today. What caused the change in the orbit of Venus?
I shall pose another problem besides the first. Mars did not arouse any fears in the hearts of the
ancient astrologers, and its name was seldom mentioned in the second millennium. In AssyroBabylonia, in inscriptions made before the ninth century, the name of Nergal is found only on
rare occasions. On the astronomical ceiling of Senmut Mars does not appear among the planets.
It did not play any conspicuous part in the early mythology of the celestial gods.
But in the ninth or eighth century before this era, the situation changed radically. Mars became
the dreaded planet. Accordingly, Mars-Nergal rose to the position of the frightful storm and war
god. The question must then present itself: Why, previous to that time,
244
WORLDS IN COLLISION
245
did Mars signify no danger to the earth, and what caused Mars to shift its orbit nearer to the
earth?
The planets of the solar system move in nearly the same plane, and if one planet were to revolve
along a stretched ellipse, it would endanger the other planets. The two problems—what caused
Venus to change its orbit, and what caused Mars to change its orbit—may have a common
explanation. The common cause may have been some comet which changed the orbits of Venus
and Mars; but it is simpler to suppose that two planets, one of which had a greatly elongated
orbit, collided, and that no third agent was necessary to bring about that result.
A conflict between Venus and Mars, if it occurred, might well have been a spectacle observable
from the earth. It is not impossible that the two planets came repeatedly into contact, each time
with different results.
If a contact between Venus and Mars really occurred and was observed from the earth, it must
have been commemorated in traditions or literary monuments.
When Was the Iliad Created?
A mighty strife had waxen great Within the members of the sphere. —Empedocles '
To this day it has not been established at what date the Iliad and Odyssey were composed. Even
ancient authors differed greatly in reckoning the time when Homer lived. It was estimated to be
as late as —685 (the historian Theopompus) and as early as —1159 (certain authorities quoted
by Philistratus). Herodotus wrote that "Homer and Hesiod" created the Greek pantheon "not
more than 400 years before me," which would mean not prior to —884, —484 being regarded as
the year of Herodotus' birth. The question is still debated. Some authors argue that there was a

robin-bobin

long interval between the time when the epic works of Homer were composed and the time when
1 The Fragments of Empedocles (transl. W. E. Leonard, 1908), p. 30.
246
WORLDS IN COLLISION
they were put into writing; others think that these works must have been created not long before
the Greeks acquired the art of writing, about —700.2 It is also argued that the Greeks must have
known this art long before —700 on the assumption that the Homeric works were created much
before that date. It is generally assumed that the fall of Troy antedated Homer by several
generations, and also that the great epic works were the creation of generations. The fall of Troy
is sometimes thought to have taken place in the twelfth century.3
On the other hand, it has been shown that the cultural background of the Homeric epos is that of
the eighth or even the seventh century; the age of iron was well under way, and many other
details would preclude an earlier scene.4 It is highly probable that the Homeric works were
created at that time or shortly thereafter. Whether these poems were first sung by a bard who
lived centuries after the destruction of Troy depends on the time when Troy was destroyed. The
tradition about Aeneas who, saved when Troy was captured, went to Carthage (a city built in the
ninth century) and from there to Italy, where he founded Rome (a city first built in the middle of
the eighth century), implies that Troy was destroyed in the eighth or late in the ninth century.
But for what purpose do I burden my present work with this question? It may seem that the two
problems—how Venus changed its orbit to a circle, and how Mars changed its orbit so as to
come in contact with the earth—are weighted with a third problem from a far-removed field and
in itself complicated. And even if these matters have something in common, how can a problem
with three unknowns be solved?
We shall come closer to a solution of the astronomical problem

with which we are concerned and the problem of the epics of Troy if we recognize the cosmic
scene of these epics.
A simple test can be made. If Ares, the Mars of the Greeks, is not mentioned in the creations of
Homer, this would support the view that the Iliad and Odyssey were created in the tenth century
or earlier, or at least that the drama they describe had taken place not later than this time. But if
Ares is presented as a war god in these epics, it would indicate that they were composed in the
eighth century or thereafter. It was in the eighth century that Mars-Nergal, an obscure deity,
became a prominent god. Epic poems, rich in mythology, that originated in the eighth or seventh
century, would not be silent about Mars-Ares, who became "outrageous" at that time.
With this yardstick at hand, the epic poems of Homer must be re-examined. The task will not be
difficult; the Iliad is full of descriptions of the violent deeds of Ares.
In this epic the story is told of the battles which the Greeks, besieging Troy, waged against the
people of Priam, king of Troy. Deities took a prominent part in these battles and skirmishes. Two
of them— Athene and Ares—were by far the most active. Athene was the protectress of the
Greeks; Ares was on the side of the Trojans. They were the chief antagonists throughout the
epopee.
At first Athene removed Ares from the battlefield:
And flashing-eyed Athene took furious Ares by the hand and spake to him, saying: "Ares, Ares,
thou bane of mortals, thou blood-stained stormer of walls, shall we not now leave the Trojans
and Achaeans to fight?" . . . [She] led furious Ares forth from the battle.5
But they met together again in the field; "furious Ares" was "abiding on the left of the battle."

Aphrodite, the goddess of the moon, wished to participate in the war also, but Zeus, presiding in
heavenly Olympus, told her:
"Not unto thee, my child, are given works of war; nay, follow thou after the lovely works of
marriage, and all these things shall be the business of swift Ares and Athene."

Thus the god of the planet Jupiter admonished the goddess of the moon to leave the combat that
it might be fought out by the god of the planet Mars and the goddess of the planet Venus.
Phoebus Apollo, the god of the sun, spoke to the god of the planet Mars:
Then unto furious Ares spake Phoebus Apollo: "Ares, Ares, thou bane of mortals, thou bloodstained stormer of walls, wilt thou not now enter into the battle?" . . .
And baneful Ares entered amid the Trojans'ranks. . . . He called: . . . "How long will ye still
suffer your host to be slain by the Achaeans?"
The battlefield was darkened by Ares:
And about the battle furious Ares drew a veil of night to aid the Trojans ... he saw that Pallas
Athene was departed, for she it was that bare aid to the Danaans.
Hera, the goddess of the earth, "stepped upon the flaming car" and "self-bidden groaned upon
their hinges the gates of heaven which the Hours had in their keeping, to whom are entrusted
great heaven and Olympus." She spoke to Zeus:
"Zeus, hast thou no indignation with Ares for these violent deeds, that he hath destroyed so great
and so goodly a host of the Achaeans recklessly? . . . Wilt thou in any wise be wroth with me if I
smite Ares?"
And Zeus replied:
"Nay, come now, rouse against him Athene . . . who has ever been wont above others to bring
sore pain upon him."
So came the hour of the battle.
Then Pallas Athene grasped the lash and the reins, and against Ares first she speedily drave. . . .
Athene put on the cap of Hades, to the end that mighty Ares should not see her.
Ares, "the bane of mortals," was attacked by Pallas Athene, who sped the spear "mightily against
his nethermost belly."
"Then brazen Ares bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle, when
they join in the strife of the War-god."

Even as a black darkness appeareth from the clouds when after heat a blustering wind ariseth,
even in such wise . . . did brazen Ares appear, as he fared amid the clouds unto broad heaven.
In heaven he appealed to Zeus with bitter words of complaint against Athene:
"With thee are we all at strife, for thou art father to that mad and baneful maid, whose mind is
ever set on deeds of lawlessness. For all the other gods that are in Olympus are obedient unto
thee . . . but to her thou payest no heed ... for that this pestilent maiden is thine own child."
And Zeus answered:
"Most hateful to me art thou of all gods that hold Olympus, for ever is strife dear to thee and
wars and fightings."
The first round was lost by Ares. "Hera and Athene . . . made Ares, the bane of mortals, to cease
from his manslaying."
In this vein the poem proceeds, its allegorical features being only too readily overlooked. In the
fifth book of the Iliad Ares is called by name more than thirty times, and throughout the poem he
never disappears from the scene, whether in the sky or on the battleground. The twentieth and
twenty-first books describe the climax of the battle of the gods at the walls of Troy.
[Athene] would utter her loud cry. And over against her spouted Ares, dread as a dark whirlwind,
calling with shrill tones to the Trojans.

Thus did the blessed gods urge on the two hosts to clash in battle, and amid them made grievous
strife to burst forth. Then terribly thundered the father of gods and men from on high; and from
beneath did Poseidon cause the vast earth to quake, and the steep crests of the mountains. All the
roots of many-fountained Ida were shaken, and all her peaks, and the city of the Trojans, and the
ships of the Achaeans. And seized with fear in the world below was Ai'doneus, lord of the shades
. . . lest above him the earth be cloven by Poseidon, the Shaker of Earth, and his abode be made
plain to view for mortals and immortals ... so great was the din that arose when the gods clashed
in strife.
In this battle of gods above and beneath, Trojans and Achaeans clashed together and the whole
universe roared and shivered. The
250
WORLDS IN COLLISION
battle was fought in gloom; Hera spread a thick mist. The river "rushed with surging flood, and
roused all his streams tumultuously." Even the ocean was inspired with "fear of the lightning of
great Zeus and his dread thunder, whenso it crasheth from heaven." Then rushed into the battle a
"wondrous blazing fire. First on the plain was the fire kindled, and burned the dead . . . and all
the plain was parched." Then to the river turned the gleaming flame. "Tormented were the eels
and the fish in the eddies, and in the fair streams they plunged this way and that. . . . The fair
streams seethed and boiled." Nor had the river "any mind to flow onward, but was stayed,"
unable to protect Troy.
Upon the gods "fell strife heavy and grievous." "Together then they clashed with a mighty din,
and the wide earth rang, and round about great heaven pealed as with a trumpet. . . . Zeus—the
heart within him laughed aloud in joy as he beheld the gods joining in strife."
Ares . . . began the fray, and first leapt upon Athene, brazen spear in hand, and spake a word of
reviling: "Wherefore now again, thou dog-fly, art thou making gods to clash with gods in strife .
. . ? Rememberest thou not what time . . . thyself in sight of all didst grasp the spear and let drive
straight at me, and didst rend my fair flesh?"
This second encounter between Ares and Athene was also lost by Ares.
He [Ares] smote upon her tasselled aegis. . . . Thereon bloodstained Ares smote with his long
spear. But she gave ground, and seized with her stout hand a stone that lay upon the plain, black
and jagged and great. . . . Therewith she smote furious Ares on the neck, and loosed his limbs. . .
.
Pallas Athene broke into a laugh. . . . "Fool, not even yet hast thou learned how much mightier
than thou I avow me to be, that thou matchest thy strength with mine."
Aphrodite came to wounded Ares, "took [him] by the hand, and sought to lead [him] away." But
"Athene sped in pursuit. . . . She smote Aphrodite on the breast with her stout hand . . . and her
heart melted."

These excerpts from the Iliad show that some cosmic drama was projected upon the fields of
Troy. The commentators were aware that originally Ares was not merely the god of war, and that
this quality is a deduced and secondary one. The Greek Ares is the Latin planet Mars; it is so
stated in classic literature a multitude of times. In the so-called Homeric poems, too, it is said
that Ares is a planet. The Homeric hymn to Ares reads:
Most mighty Ares . . . chieftain of valor, revolving thy fiery circle in ether among the seven
wandering stars [planets], where thy flaming steeds ever uplift thee above the third chariot.6
But what might it mean, that the planet Mars destroys cities, or that the planet Mars is ascending
the sky in a darkened cloud, or that it engages Athene (the planet Venus) in battle? Ares must
have represented some element in nature, guessed the commentators. Ares must have been the
personification of the raging storm, or the god of the sky, or the god of light, or a sun-god, and so
on.7 These explanations are futile. Ares-Mars is what his name says—the planet Mars.

I find in Lucian a statement which corroborates my interpretation of the cosmic drama in the
Iliad. This author of the second century of the present era writes in his work On Astrology this
most significant and most neglected commentary on the Homeric epics:
"All that he [Homer] hath said of Venus and of Mars his passion, is also manifestly composed
from no other source than this science [astrology]. Indeed, it is the conjuncture of Venus and
Mars that creates the poetry of Homer." 8
Lucian is unaware that Athene is the goddess of the planet Venus,9
6 The Odyssey of Homer with the Hymns (transl. Buckley), p. 399. The translation by H.
Evelyn-White (Hesiod volume in the Loeb Classical Library) is: "Who whirl your fiery sphere
among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the ether wherein your blazing steeds ever
bear you above the third firmament of heaven." Allen, Holliday, and Sikes, The Homeric Hymns
(1936), p. 385, regard the hymn to Ares as post-Homeric.
7 These divergent views are offered by L. Preller (Griechische Myihologie [1894]), G. F. Lauer
{System der griechischen Myihologie [1853], p. 224), F. G. Welcker (Griechische Gotterlehre, I

and yet he knows the real meaning of the cosmic plot of the Homeric epic, which shows that the
sources of his instruction in astrology were cognizant of the facts of the celestial drama.
My interpretation of the Homeric poem, I find, has been anticipated by still others. Who they
were, it is impossible to say. However, Heraclitus, a little known author of the first century, who
should not be confused with the philosopher, Heraclitus of Ephesus, wrote a work on Homeric
allegories.10 In his opinion, Homer and Plato were the two greatest spirits of Greece, and he
tried to reconcile the anthropomorphic and satiric description of gods by Homer with the
idealistic and metaphysical approach of Plato. In Paragraph 53 of his Allegories, Heraclitus
confutes those who think that the battles of the gods in the Iliad signify collisions of the planets.
Thus I find that some of the ancient philosophers must have held the same opinion at which I
arrived independently after a series of deductions.
The problem of the date when the Homeric epics originated was raised here, to be solved with
the help of this criterion: If the cosmic battle between the planets Venus and Mars is mentioned
there, then the epics could not have originated much before the year —800. If the earth and the
moon are involved in this struggle, the time of the birth of the Iliad must be lowered to —747 at
least and probably to an even later date. The first earthshaking contact with our planet had
already taken place, and for this reason Ares is repeatedly called "bane of mortals, blood-stained
stormer of walls."
Homer was thus, at the earliest, a contemporary of the prophets Amos and Isaiah, or more likely
he lived shortly after them. The Trojan War and the cosmic conflict were synchronous; the time
of Homer was not separated from the time of the Trojan war by several centuries, possibly not
even by a single one.
The statement by Lucian regarding the inspiring drama of the Homeric epics—the conjunction of
the planets Venus and Mars—can be refined. There was more than one fateful conjunction
between Venus and Mars—at least two are described in the Iliad, in the fifth
i° Heracliti questiones Homericae (Teubner's ed. 1910). Cf. F. Boll, Stemglaube und Sterndienst

253
and the twenty-first books. The conjunctions were near contacts; the mere passage of one planet
in front of another could not have provided material for a cosmic drama.
Huitzilopochtli
The Greeks chose Athene, the goddess of the planet Venus, as their patron, but the people of
Troy looked to Ares-Mars as their protector. A similar situation existed in ancient Mexico.
Quetzal-cohuatl, known as the planet Venus, was the patron of the Toltecs. But the Aztecs, who

robin-bobin

later came to Mexico and supplanted the Toltecs, revered Huitzilopochtli (Vitchilupuchtli) as
their protector-god.1
Sahagun says that Huitzilopochtli was "a great destroyer of towns and killer of people." The
epithet "blood-stained stormer of walls" is familiar to us from the Iliad, where it is regularly
applied to Mars. "In warfare he [Huitzilopochtli] was like live-fire, greatly feared by his
enemies," writes Sahagun.2
In his large work on the Indians of America, H. H. Bancroft writes:
"Huitzilopochtli had, like Mars and Odin, the spear or a bow in his right hand, and in the left,
sometimes a bundle of arrows, sometimes a round white shield. . . . On these weapons depended
the welfare of the state, just as on the ancile of the Roman Mars, which had fallen from the sky,
or on the palladium of the warlike Pallas Athene. Bynames also point out Huitzilopochtli as war
god; so he is called the terrible god Tetzateotl, or the raging Tetzahuitl."3 Bancroft proceeds:
"One niight be led to compare the capital of the Aztecs with ancient Rome, on account of its
warlike spirit, and therefore it was right to make the national god of Aztecs a war god like the
Roman Mars." 4
But Huitzilopochtli was not like Mars, he was Mars. The identity of their appearance, character,
and action is dictated by the fact that Mars and Huitzilopochtli were one and the same planetgod.

The conflict between Venus and Mars was also symbolized in religious ceremonies of the
ancient Mexicans. In one of these ceremonies the priest of Quetzal-cohuatl shot an arrow into an
effigy of Huitzilo-pochtli, which penetrated the god, who was then considered dead.5 This
appears to have been a symbolic repetition of the electrical discharge that Venus ejected toward
Mars.
But the Aztecs would not concede the death of Mars, the bellicose destroyer of towns, the god of
sword and pestilence, and carried on their wars against the Toltecs, the people who looked to the
planet Venus. These wars between the Toltecs and the Aztecs must have taken place earlier than
is generally supposed; they might have occurred before the present era, when there was rivalry
between the peoples devoted to Venus and those devoted to Mars, and when the memory of the
cosmic conflict was still vivid.
Tao

Planets of the solar system were disturbed by the contacts of Venus, Mars, and the earth. We
have already referred to the annals of the Bamboo Books, where it is written that in the tenth
year of the Emperor Kwei, the eighteenth monarch since Yahou, "the five planets went out of
their courses. In the night, stars fell like rain. The earth shook."J The disturbances in the family
of planets were caused by collisions between Venus and Mars. The battles of two stars appearing
as bright as suns are mentioned in another Chinese chronicle as having occurred in the days of
the same Emperor Kwei (Koei-Kie):
"At this time the two suns were seen to battle in the sky. The five

planets were agitated by unusual movements. A part of Mount Tai-chan fell down." 2
The two battling stars are recognized by us as Venus and Mars. In the language of Eratosthenes,
the Alexandrian librarian of the third century before this era: "In the third place is the star [stella]

robin-bobin

of Mars. ... It was pursued by the star [sidus] Venus; then Venus took hold of him and inflamed
him with an ardent passion." 3
In an astronomical chart dating from the Middle Ages (1193), used in the education of emperors
and known as the Soochow Astronomical Chart,4 it is asserted on the authority of the ancients
that it happened that planets went off their courses. It is said that once Venus ran far off the
zodiac and attacked the "Wolf-Star." A change in the course of the planets was regarded as a sign
of heavenly wrath, since it occurred when the emperor or his ministers sinned.
In the old Chinese cosmology "Earth is represented as a body suspended in air, moving
eastward,"5 and thus was understood as one of the planets.
The following passage from the Taoist text of Wen-Tze 6 contains a description of calamities
which, as we have found, belong together:
"When the sky, hostile to living beings, wishes to destroy them, it burns them; the sun and the
moon lose their form and are eclipsed; the five planets leave their paths; the four seasons
encroach one upon another; daylight is obscured; glowing mountains collapse; rivers are dried
up; it thunders then in winter, hoarfrost falls in summer; the atmosphere is thick and human
beings are choked; the state perishes; the aspect and the order of the sky are altered; the customs
of the age are disturbed [thrown into disorder] ... all living beings harass one another."
Hoei-nan-tze, a Taoist author of the third century of this era, speaks of the sun and the earth
leaving their paths; he transmits the tradi2L. Wieger, Textes historiques (2nd ed., 1922-1923), I, 50.

tion that "if the five planets err on their routes," the State and the provinces are overcome by a
flood.7
Taoism is the dominant religion of China. "The term Tao originally meant the revolution of the
way of the heavens about the earth. This movement of the heavens was regarded as the cause of
the phenomena on earth. The Tao was located about the celestial pole which was considered to
be the seat of power because all revolves about it. In the course of time Tao was viewed as the
universal cosmic energy behind the visible order of nature." 8
Yuddha
In an old textbook on Hindu astronomy, the Surya-Siddhanta, there is a chapter, "Of planetary
conjunctions." Modern astronomy knows only one kind of conjunction between planets, when
one planet (or sun) stands between the earth and another planet (differentiated only as superior
and inferior conjunction and opposition). But ancient Hindu astronomy distinguished between
many different conjunctions, translated as follows: samyoga (conjunction), sama-gama (coming
together), yoga (junction), melaka (uniting), yuti (union), yuddha (encounter, in the meaning of
conflict, fight).1
The first paragraph of this chapter, "Of planetary conjunctions," of the Surya-Siddhanta tells us
that between planets there occur encounters in battle (yuddha) and simple conjunction (samyoga
samagama). The force of the planets, which manifests itself in conjunctions, is called hala. A
planet can be vanquished (jita) in an "apasvya encounter," struck down (vidhvasta), utterly
vanquished (vijita). A powerful planet is called balin, and the victor-planet in an encounter,
jayin. "Venus is generally victor."
To the last sentence the translator of Surya-Siddhanta wrote: "In this passage we quit the proper
domain of astronomy, and trench upon that of astrology." Aside from the introductory lines in
which the work is presented as a revelation of the sun (a common introduc7 Hoei-nan-tze in Textes Taoistes.

tion in many astronomical works of the Hindus), it is written in very sober terms. It makes use of
square roots and geometrical figures, and speaks in algebraic terms; every sentence of the work
is in scientific language, very precious, indeed.2
This manual of the Surya contains also the correct notion of the earth as a "sphere" or "globe in
the ether," showing that the Hindus of early times knew that the earth is one of the planets,
though they thought it to be situated in the center of the universe.3 Aryabhatta held the opinion
that the earth revolves on its axis.4 Like the author of the Book of Job, who wrote that the earth
hangs "upon nothing" (26 : 7), the Surya knew that "above" and "beneath" are only relative:
"And everywhere upon the globe of the earth, men think their own place to be uppermost—but
since it is a globe in the ether, where should there be an upper, or where an under side of it?" 5
The strange chapter of Surya-Siddhanta dealing with the conjunctions of planets and with their
conflicts when in close proximity made modern scholars think that this portion did not have the
scientific value of the rest of the work, and was a product of astrological invention, or even an
interpolation. We know now that this chapter has equal scientific value with other chapters of the
work and that encounters between planets actually took place a number of times in the solar
system.
In Hindu astronomy a junction of the planets is called yoga [yuga]. Very revealing is the fact that
the world ages are also called yogas, planetary conjunctions 6 (or more precisely, junctions).

overhead." (Chap. xii.)

Indo-Iranian text of the Bundahis.1 "The planets ran against the sky
and created confusion" in the entire cosmos.2
In the long battle of the celestial bodies, one of them made the world entirely dark, disfigured
creation, and filled it with vermin. This act of the cosmic drama was recognized by us as the first
contact of the earth with the comet Typhon, the same as Pallas Athene. Other acts of the drama
followed. The planetary disturbances lasted for a long time. "The celestial sphere was in
revolution. . . . The planets, with many demons, dashed against the celestial sphere, and mixed
the constellations; and the whole creation was as disfigured as though fire disfigured every place
and smoke arose over it." 3
The planet named Gokihar or "Wolf-progeny" and "special disturber of the moon,"4 and a
celestial body called Mievish-Muspar, "provided with tails," or a comet,5 brought confusion to
the sun, moon, and stars. But in the end "the sun has attached Muspar to its own radiance by
mutual agreement, so that he may be less able to do harm." 6
In this description of "the battle of the planets," we recognize the wolf-progeny and disturber of
the moon, the planet Gokihar, as Mars; Muspar with tails apparently is Venus, called also
Tistrya, or "the leader of the stars against the planets." As the final result of these battles, the sun
made Venus into an evening-morning star or put Lucifer lower down so that it could do no harm.
In the Bundahis the conflicting forces are called, not "gods," but merely "planets."

For about seven hundred years this terror hung over mankind like the sword of Damocles.
Human sacrifices were made to Venus in both hemispheres in order to propitiate her.
After centuries of terror, one sword of Damocles was removed from above the heads of mankind,
only to be replaced by another. Mars became the dread of the peoples, and its return was feared
every fifteen years. Before this, Mars had absorbed the blow, even the repeated blows of Venus,
and had saved the earth.
Venus, which collided with the earth in the fifteenth century before the present era, collided with
Mars in the eighth century. At that time Venus was moving at a lower elliptical velocity than
when it first encountered the earth; but Mars, being only about one-eighth the mass of Venus,
was no match for her. It was therefore a notable achievement that Mars, though thrown out of the
ring, nevertheless was instrumental in bringing Venus from an elliptical to a nearly circular 1
orbit. Looked at from the earth, Venus was removed from a path that ran high to the zenith and
over the zenith to its present path 2 in which it never retreats from the sun more than 48 degrees,
thus becoming a morning or an evening star that precedes the rising sun or follows the setting
sun. The awe of the world for many centuries, Venus became a tame planet.
Isaiah, referring figuratively to the king of Babylon who destroyed cities and made the land into
a wilderness, uttered his remarkable words about Lucifer that fell from heaven and was cut down
to the ground. The commentators recognized that behind these words applied to the king of
Babylon must have been some legend about the Morning Star. The metaphor regarding the king
of Babylon implied that his fate and the fate of the Morning Star were not dissimilar; both of
them fell from on high. But what could it mean that the Morning Star fell from the heights?
asked the commentators.
Significant are the words of Isaiah about the Morning Star, that it "weakened the nations" before
it was cut down to the ground. It weakened the nations in two collisions with the earth, and it

ened the nations by keeping them in constant fear for centuries. The Book of Isaiah, in every
chapter, provides abundant evidence that with the removal of Venus, so that it no longer crossed
the orbit of the earth, danger was not eliminated, but became even more threatening.
CHAPTER 4
Sword-God
IN BABYLON of the eighth century the planet Mars became a great and feared god, to whom
many prayers were composed and hymns and invocations were sung and magic formulas were
whispered. Such formulas are referred to as "magic words with raising the hand to the planet
Nergal [Mars]." These prayers were addressed directly to the planet Mars.1 Like the Greek Ares,
Nergal is called "king of battle, who brings the defeat, who brings the victory." Nergal could not
be regarded as favoring the people of the Double Streams; on a most fateful night he inflicted a
defeat on Sennacherib.

Often before and later, too, celestial prodigies assumed the shape of swords. Thus, in the days of

comet appeared in the form of a human being "between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn
sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem." 2
The Roman god Mars was pictured with a sword; he became the god of war. The Chaldean
Nergal is called "Sword-god." Of this sword Isaiah spoke when he predicted the repetition of the
catastrophe, a stream of brimstone, flame, storm, and reeling of the sky. "Then shall the Assyrian
fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him . . .
and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign." 3 "And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved . . .
for my sword shall be bathed in heaven." *
The ancients classified the comets according to their appearance. In old astrological texts, as in
the book of Prophecies of Daniel, comets that took the form of a sword were originally related to
the planet Mars.5
Besides the swordlike appearance of the atmosphere of Mars, elongated on its approach to the
earth, there was also another reason to make of the planet Mars the god of war. A bellicose or
martial character was ascribed to the planet because of the great excitement it caused, excitement
that brought anxiety to peoples, that led to migrations and to wars. Since early times celestial
prodigies have been regarded as portents that forecast great commotions and great wars.
A planet that collided with other planets in the sky and rushed against the earth as if with a firesword became the god of battle, wresting this title from the hands of Athene-Ishtar.
"The gods of heaven put themselves in war against thee," the hymns to the planet Nergal say,
and this is the war that was recounted in the Iliad.
Nergal was named quarradu rabu, "the great warrior"; he waged war against gods and the earth.
The most frequent ideogram for Nergal in Semitic cuneiform is read namsaru, which means
"sword"; 6

the planet Mars, in the Babylonian inscriptions of the seventh century, was called "the most
violent among the gods."
Herodotus said that the Scythians worshiped Ares (Mars), and that a scimitar of iron was their
image of him; to him they made human sacrifices and poured the blood on the scimitar.7 Solinus
wrote of the people of Scythia: "The god of this people is Mars; instead of images they worship
swords." 8
War in heaven among the colliding planets, war on earth among the nations wandering in unrest,
a planet running toward the earth with an outstretched flaming sword, attacking land and sea,
participating in the wars among the nations—all these made Mars the god of war.
The sword of the god of battle was not like the sword "of a mighty man"; it was not thrust into
the belly, and yet it caused sickness and death. The god of war scattered pestilence. In a prayer to
the planet Mars (Nergal) it is said: 9

robin-bobin

Radiant abode, that beams over the land . . .
Who is thy equal?
When thou ridest in the battle,
When thou throwest down,
Who can escape thy look?
Who can run away from thy storming?
Thy word is a mighty catch net,
Stretched over Sky and Earth. . . .
His word makes human beings sick, It enfeebles them.
His word—when he makes his way above-Makes the country sick.
The outbreak of pestilence that appears to have accompanied the first contact with the planet
Mars was repeated on each subsequent contact. Amos uttered these words: "I have smitten you
with blasting and mildew. ... I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt."

The planet Nergal was regarded by the Babylonians as the god of war and pestilence; thus, too,
did the Greeks regard the planet Ares and the Romans the planet Mars.
Fenris-Wolf
In the Babylonian astrological texts it is said that "a star takes the shape of divers animals: lion,
jackal, dog, pig, fish."1 This, in our opinion, explains the worship of animals by ancient peoples,
notably by the Egyptians.
The planet Mars, its atmosphere distorted by its approaches to other celestial bodies—Venus,
earth, moon—took on different shapes. The Mexicans narrated that Huitzilopochtli, the bellicose
destroyer of cities, took the form of various birds and beasts.2 On one occasion Mars very
characteristically resembled a wolf or a jackal. In Babylonia Mars had seven names—Jackal was
one of them.3 Also, the god with the head of a jackal or wolf in the Egyptian pantheon was
apparently Mars. Of him it is said that he is a "prowling wolf circling this land." *
In the Chinese Chart of Soochow, in which it is related on the authority of more ancient sources
that "Once Venus suddenly ran into the Wolf-Star," Wolf-Star apparently means Mars.5
Wolf or Lupus Martius was the animal symbol for Mars of the Roman religion.6 It gave rise to
the legend about Romulus, son of Mars, who was fed by a she-wolf. According to the tradition,
the conception of Romulus took place during a prolonged eclipse.

figures of wolves. "Among the animal symbols of Mars, the wolf holds first place. . . . The wolf
belonged so definitely to Mars that Lupus Martius or Martialis became its usual name. As to the
meaning of this symbol, it is difficult to understand it." Roscher in Roscher's Lexikon d.

The Slavic Vukadlak, who followed the clouds and devoured the sun or the moon, had the shape
of a wolf.7 The North-Germanic tribes, too, spoke of the wolf Skoll that pursued the sun.8 In the
Edda, the planetary god that darkened the sun is called Fenris-Wolf. "Whence comes the sun to
the smooth sky back, when Fenris has swallowed it forth?" The battle of Mars and Venus is
presented, in the Icelandic epos, as a fight between the wolf Fenris and the serpent Midgard.

heard in many parts of the world. As I have already said, Mars was named the war god not only
because of his swordlike appearance, but also because of these conflicts.
". . . The land [is] darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his
brother," said Isaiah (9 : 19). In Egypt an inscription of the eighth century that refers to the moon
disturbed in its movement, mentions incessant fighting in the land: "While years passed in
hostility, each one seizing upon his neighbor, not remembering his son to protect."1 Isaiah,
speaking of the Day of Wrath, says: "And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city,
and kingdom against kingdom." 2 It was no different seven hundred years earlier, in the days of
the catastrophes caused by Venus. At that time an Egyptian sage complained: "I show thee the
land upside down; the sun is veiled and shines not in the sight of men. I show thee the son as
enemy, the brother as foe, a man slaying his father." 3
The Icelandic Voluspa says: "Dark grows the sun. . . . Brothers shall fight and fell each other. . . .
Axe-time, sword-time, shields are sundered, wind-time, wolf-time, ere the world falls; nor ever
shall men each other spare." *
The wars of Shalmaneser IV, Sargon II, and Sennacherib were carried on in the intervals
between the catastrophes and at the very time of their occurrence. The campaigns were
repeatedly interrupted by the forces of nature. Of his second campaign Sennacherib wrote: "The
month of rain set in with extreme cold and the heavy storms sent down rain upon rain and snow.
I was afraid of the swollen mountain streams; the front of my yoke I turned and took the road to
Nineveh."5 Before Sennacherib set out on his last campaign to Palestine, his astrologers told him
that he had to hurry if he would

escape calamity; 6 as we know, he did not escape it. At the same time Isaiah, who encouraged
Hezekiah to resist Sennacherib, reckoned with the possibility of a disaster in the year of the
opposition of Mars, and thus built his hope on the intervention of the forces of nature.
The Babylonians called the year of the close opposition of Mars "the year of the fire-god," and
the month "the month of descent of the fire-god," as, for instance, in an inscription of Sargon.7

In The Birth of the War-God, the Hindu poet Kalidasa gives a vivid picture of the wars above
and on the earth, weaving them into one great battle.
"Foul birds came, a horrid flock to see . . . and dimmed the sun. . . . And monstrous snakes, as
black as powdered soot, spitting hot poison high into the air, brought terror to the army
underfoot. . . . The sun a sickly halo round him had; coiling within it frightened eyes could see
great, writhing serpents . . . and in the very circle of the sun were phantom jackals."
There fell, with darting flame and blinding flash Lighting the farthest heavens, from on high A
thunderbolt whose agonising crash Brought fear and shuddering from a cloudless sky.
There came a pelting rain of blazing coals With blood and bones of dead men mingled in; Smoke
and weird flashes horrified their souls; The sky was dusty grey like asses' skin.
The elephants stumbled and the horses fell, The footmen jostled, leaving each his post, The
ground beneath them trembled at the swell Of ocean, when an earthquake shook the host.8
Lightning is usually discharged between two clouds or a cloud and the ground. But if for some
reason the charge of the ionosphere, the electrified layer of the upper atmosphere, should be
sufficiently increased, a discharge would occur between the upper atmosphere

and the ground, and a thunderbolt would crash from a cloudless sky.
The planet-god Shiva, Kalidasa says, "deposited his seed in fire" and gave birth to Kumara who
battled the great demon named Taraka that "troubled the world."
The Babylonian astrologers ascribed to their planet-gods the ability to emit the sounds of
different animals—lion, pig, jackal, horse, ass—and of two species of birds.9 The ancient
Chinese likewise asserted that planets emit animal sounds when they approach the earth with a
rain of stones.10 It is fairly probable that on some occasion the crash of the discharge "from the
cloudless sky" sounded like Ta-ra-ka, the name of the demon who battled the planets.
The Ethiopian king who went up against Sennacherib called himself Taharka or Tirhakah.11 In

The night when Sennacherib's army was destroyed, he survived, but according to rabbinical
sources, was badly burned. Some time after his inglorious return from Palestine without his
army, he was killed by two of his sons as he knelt in a temple; Esarhaddon pursued his brotherpatricides, killed them, and became king. On one of his campaigns against Egypt, his armies
became so panicky at some natural phenomenon that they scattered and fled from Palestine
where Sennacherib had lost his army to the storm-god Nergal. The laconic cuneiform chronicles,
composed in the days of Nabonidus, the last Babylonian king, who lived in the sixth century,
record the main events of Esarhaddon's war: "In the sixth year the troops of

Assyria went to Egypt. They fled before a great storm." 1S An army as disciplined as the
Assyrian army under one of its famous kings would not have run away from a cloudburst. The
event mentioned in this inscription suggested to its modern publisher that the scriptural story of a
blast that destroyed the Assyrian host refers, not to Sennacherib's army, but to that of his
successor-son; otherwise one must think that on two similar occasions a natural cause subdued
the Assyrian army. However, it is probable that after the army of Sennacherib was annihilated,
violent atmospheric discharges and some portents in the sky, so numerous in those years, threw
the Assyrian troops into a panic so that they fled.

The trembling earth, the displacement of the poles, the change in the climate, the frightening
prodigies in the sky, caused great movements of peoples. The Aztecs changed their homeland.
"These Mexicans carried with them an idol which they called Huitzilo-pochtli. . . . They asserted

life. The Mexicans departed like the children of Israel in their search of a promised land." 13 In
India the patron of the invading Aryan race was Indra, the god of war, the Hindu Mars.
The Ionians and Dorians spread to the islands, the Latins were pressed by newcomers to the

Synodos
We remember that Josephus Flavius, after giving Herodotus' account of the destruction of
Sennacherib's army, intended to quote a divergent account of Berosus, and introduced it with the
words, "Here is what wrote Berosus," but the account is not preserved.
12 Sidney Smith, Babylonian Historical Texts (1924), p. 5.

Now, if we know what happened on the night of March 23, —687, are we not able to find out
what the missing account of Berosus was?
We can assume that Berosus knew that the catastrophe was caused by a planet in contact with the
earth. Seneca, in his work, Naturales quaestiones, described the cataclysms of water and fire that
visited this world and brought it to the brink of destruction. He also presented the opinion of
Berosus, which is remarkable in that it reflects ancient knowledge similar to that at which we
arrived after a long series of deductions and conclusions. Seneca wrote: "Berosus, the translator
of Bel, attributed to the planets the cause of these perturbations." And he added: "His certainty in
this matter was so great as to fix the dates of the universal conflagration and deluge. Everything
terrestrial, he says, will be burned, when the stars which now follow different orbits will reunite
in the sign of Cancer, and will place themselves in one line, so that a straight line would pass
through the centers of all these globes. The deluge will come when the same planets will have
conjunction in Capricorn." 1
Disregarding the specific details of this assumption, there still remains a kernel of truth. The
catastrophes of flood and of conflagration were ascribed to the influence of planets, and the
conjunction was called the fatal moment. Such being the opinion of Berosus on the cause of the
world catastrophes, the catastrophe that befell Sennacherib was probably explained by him in the
same way. We are thus able to reconstruct Berosus' record which was omitted in Josephus.
Chaldean scholars were aware that the planetary system is not rigid and that the planets undergo
changes. We find in Diodorus of Sicily: "Each of the planets, according to them [the Chaldeans]
has its own particular course, and its velocities and periods of time are subject to change and
variation." 2 They counted the earth among the planets, for Diodorus wrote that the Chaldeans
stated "that the

moon's light is reflected and her eclipses are due to the shadow of the earth." 3 This implies that
they knew the earth is a sphere in space, a fact known also to a number of Greek philosophers.4

robin-bobin

A few Greek philosophers were aware that planets, on close contact, are greatly disturbed, and
that out of their agitated atmospheres comets are born. The perturbations in such contacts may be
so strong that, when the earth is involved, deluge or world conflagration may take place.
Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school of thought, 5 and likewise Anaxagoras (-500 to -428) and
Democritus (-460 to -320), declared that planets at conjunction may become coalescent, thus
taking the form of comets. Aristotle, who misunderstood their teaching, declared: "We have
ourselves observed Jupiter coinciding with one of the stars of the Twain and hiding it, and yet no
comet was formed." 6
Diogenes Laertius recorded that Anaxagoras thought that comets are "a conjunction of planets
which emit flames" 7; and Seneca, without naming Anaxagoras and Democritus, wrote: "Here is
the explanation which is given by some ancient authors. When a planet enters in conjunction
with another, they confound their lights into one light, and they have the appearance of an
elongated star. . . . The interval which separates them is illuminated by both of them, inflames
and transforms into a trail of fire." 8 Seneca, who regarded this as an explanation of the nature of
comets, questioned it, reasoning that "planets cannot remain for a long time in conjunctions,
because by necessity of the law of velocity they would separate."
Plato, on the authority of the Egyptian sages, ascribed the deluge and conflagration of the world
to the action of a celestial body that, changing its path, passed close by the earth, and he even
pointed to the planets as the cause of periodic world catastrophes.9 The Greek

term for the collision of planets is synodos, which, in the words of a modern interpreter, requires
a meeting in space and also a collision of planets.10
The Romans knew that the earth is one of the planets; Pliny, for instance, wrote: "Human beings
are distributed all around the earth and stand with their feet pointing toward each other. . . .
Another marvel, that the earth herself hangs suspended and does not fall and carry us with it." n
The earth, one of the planets, had been subject to conflicts with other planets, and traces of
knowledge of these occurrences may be found in the early writers. Origen writing against Celsus
stated: "We do not refer either the deluge or the conflagration to the cycles and planetary
periods; but the cause of them we declare to be the extensive prevalence of wickedness, and its
(consequent) removal by a deluge or a conflagration." 12 Celsus and Origen were familiar with
the view that the deluge and the world conflagration were caused by planets, and that these world
catastrophes could be calculated in advance.
Pliny wrote: "Most men are not acquainted with a truth known to the founders of the science
from their arduous study of the heavens," namely, that thunderbolts "are the fires of the three
upper planets." 13 He differentiated them from lightning caused by the dashing together of two
clouds. Seneca, his contemporary, also distinguished lightnings that "seek houses" or "lesser
bolts" and the bolts of Jupiter "by which the threefold mass of mountains fell." 14
A vivid picture of an interplanetary discharge is given by Pliny: "Heavenly fire is spit forth by
the planet as crackling charcoal flies from a burning log." 15 If such a discharge falls on the
earth, "it is
10 Boll, Sternglmihe, pp. 93 and 201. The Greek term "requires a meeting in the same horizontal

accompanied by a very great disturbance of the air," produced "by the birth-pangs, so to speak,
of the planet in travail." 16
Pliny says also that a bolt from Mars fell on Bolsena, "the richest town in Tuscany," and that the
city was entirely burned up by this bolt.17 He refers to Tuscan writings as the source of his
information. By Tuscan writings are meant Etruscan books.
Bolsena, or the ancient Volsinium, was one of the chief cities of the Etruscans, the people whose
civilization preceded that of the Latin Romans on the Apennine Peninsula. The Etruscan states
occupied the area of what was later known as Tuscany, between the Tiber and the Arno.
Near Bolsena, or Volsinium, is a lake of the same name. This lake fills a basin nine miles long,
seven miles wide, and 285 feet deep. For a long time this basin was regarded as the water-filled
crater of a volcano. However, its area of 117 square kilometers exceeds by far that of the largest
known craters on the earth—those in the Andes in South America and those in the Hawaiian
(Sandwich) Islands in the Pacific. Hence, the idea that the lake is the crater of an extinct volcano
has recently been questioned. Moreover, although the bottom of the lake is of lava, and the
ground around the lake abounds with ashes and lava and columns of basalt, the talus of a volcano
is lacking.
Taking what Pliny said of an interplanetary discharge together with what has actually been found
at Volsinium, one may wonder whether the cinders and the lava and the columns of basalt could
possibly be the remains of the contact Pliny mentions. Again, if the discharge was caused by
Mars, it would probably have occurred in the eighth pre-Christian century. The catastrophes of
that century brought the great Etruscan civilization into sudden decline and launched the
migration of newcomers to Italy leading to the founding of Rome. The Etruscans, as cited by
Censorinus and quoted in the Section on "The World Ages," thought that celestial prodigies
augured the end of each age. "The Etruscans were versed in the science of the stars, and after
having observed the prodigies with attention, they recorded these observations in their books."

The Stormer of the Walls
Following the upheavals in which, in the words of the Babylonians, Mars-Nergal "moved the
earth off its hinges," and, in the words of Isaiah, "the earth moved exceedingly" and was
"removed out of her place," mighty and repeated earthquakes devastated whole countries,
destroyed cities, and shattered the walls of strongholds. "Bloodstained stormer of walls" is the
ever repeated epithet of Ares in Homer. Hesiod, too, calls Ares "sacker of towns."* "Behold,"
said Amos, "the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches [into
pieces]." Then came the "commotion" of the days of Uzziah, and of the days of Ahaz, and of the
days of Hezekiah, when "the bricks are fallen down" (Isaiah 9 :10) and only "a very small
remnant" of the people remained (Isaiah 1:9). Those were days of "trouble, and of treading
down, and of perplexity by the Lord God of Hosts" and "breaking down the walls" (Isaiah 22 :
5).
Recurrent displacement of the terrestrial globe, torsion of the litho-sphere, and migration of the
inner parts of the globe must have caused a succession of earthquakes over a prolonged period.
But in comparison with the great catastrophes, when "heaven reeled," the local earthquakes
received only slight attention.
In the reports of the astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon, earthquakes are often mentioned in just
a single line, as in the following message: "Last night there was an earthquake." The frequent
trembling of the earth became a source of omens for the magicians, which were reduced to
formulas: "When the earth quakes in the month of Shevat," or "When the earth quakes in the
month of Nisan," then one or another event will take place. As in the following sentence, the

robin-bobin

observation could be basically correct: "When the earth quakes through the whole day, there will
be a destruction of the land. When it quakes continually, there will be an invasion of the enemy."

seventh centuries are very numerous, and they are dated.3 Nothing comparable is known in
modern times. In some of these reports, Nergal (Mars) is mentioned as the cause of the calamity.
"The earth shook; a collapsing catastrophe was all over the country; Nergal strangles the
country."4 Temples constructed with great care, so that the foundations might absorb shocks and
resist them, were often destroyed by the catastrophes, and the cause was again the planet Nergal.
Thus Nergal is referred to in connection with the collapse of the temple in Nippur that was
destroyed in an earthquake.5
The kings of Babylon, the successors to Sennacherib, record im many inscriptions the repairing
of breaches in the palaces and temples of the land. Sometimes the same temples or palaces were
repaired by two kings in close succession, as in the case of Nergilissar (Neriglissar) and
Nebuchadnezzar.8 In the great catastrophes of the eighth to the seventh centuries, practically no
structure escaped damage, and new buildings were erected so as to absorb frequent shocks. At
the close of the seventh century, Nebuchadnezzar described the precautions taken in placing the
foundations of the palaces "on the breast of the netherworld"; these foundations of large stones
with joints fitting one into the other have been unearthed in excavations.7 The Babylonians also
found that walls of burnt bricks were of greater elasticity than walls of stones; they were built on
foundations of great blocks of stone.8
These ever recurrent earthshocks in a country as rich in oil as Mesopotamia also caused
eruptions of earth deposits: "The earth threw oil and asphalt," observed the official astrologers,
as the effect of an earthquake.9

The Scriptures and the rabbinical sources record repeatedly the repairing of breaches in the
House of the Lord. On the day of the "commotion" of Uzziah the temple suffered a great
breach.10 References to breaches in houses, large palaces, and small dwellings are very
numerous in the prophets of the eighth century. Isaiah speaks of "breaches of the city of David
that they are many." u Repair of breaches in the Temple was the permanent concern of the kings
of Jerusalem, also "the wall that was broken" of the city's outer bulwark.12
Since in modern times earthquakes occur only very seldom in Palestine, the frequent reference of
the prophets and psalmists to them caused perplexity: "The earthquake held a place in the
religious conceptions of the Israelites quite out of proportion to its slight and relatively rare
occurrence in Palestine." 13
Troy, the scene of the Homeric epos, was destroyed by an earthquake. The famous "sixth city" at
Hissarlik, recognized as the fortress of Priam, king of the Trojans, fell because of earthshocks, a

robin-bobin

fact established in the excavation by the archaeological expedition of the University of
Cincinnati.14
There are a number of theories concerning the cause of the earthquakes, but none of them is
generally accepted. One connects the cause of earthquakes with the process of mountain
building. Mountains are supposed to have their origin in the cooling of the earth and contraction
of its crust.15 This theory is based on the assumption that originally the earth was liquid. The
folding of the crust creates mountains and causes earthquakes.
Another theory sees the cause of earthquakes in the migration of

land masses, even of entire continents. This theory, too, is based on the concept of a thin crust
resting on a viscous substratum. Geological and faunal similarities of South America and West
Africa suggested their separation in recent geological times, and their migration in opposite
directions. According to this theory, thermal convection is the mechanical cause of this
migration, with magma supplying the heat.
Still another theory supposes that there are great mountains and deep valleys on the inner surface
of the crust, facing the magma. The sliding of huge rocks along these mountainous slopes under
the pull of gravity is presumed to be the cause of earthquakes.
The mountainous western coast of North and South America, or the shore of the Cordilleras, and
the eastern coast of Asia stretching into the East Indies form the area of greatest earthquake
activity, with 80 per cent of the entire mechanical force released in earthquakes concentrated
there. Another area stretches from the Mediterranean toward the highland of Asia.
In an attempt to find the relation of earthquakes to other natural phenomena, a statistical
investigation of the earthquakes of the middle of the nineteenth century was conducted, and the
results suggested that earthquakes are more numerous when the moon is new and again when it
is full, or when the pull of the moon acts in the same direction as the pull of the sun or when it
acts in the opposite direction. The time when the moon is in perigee, or closest to the earth, was
also found to be favorable for earthquakes.16 These observations were challenged as to their
general validity.
However, mountain building is a process the causes of which have not been established; the
migration of continents is but a hypothesis; and the crumbling of the earth's crust must have
some additional cause besides the force of gravity, because this force was active when the crust
was built and made possible the formation of the crust in its present shape. Hence, all these
theories are only hypotheses about unknown causes of known phenomena.
On the basis of the material offered in the foregoing pages, the assumption is made here that
earthquakes result from torsion of the 16 Cf. the scientific publications of A. Perrey.

crust following a change in the position of the equator and the displacement of matter inside the
globe caused by the direct attraction of a cosmic body when in a close contact. Pull, torsion, and
displacement were responsible for mountain building, too.
If this conception of the causes of earthquakes is correct, then there must have been fewer and
fewer earthquakes during the course of time since the last cosmic catastrophe. The regions of the
Apennine Peninsula, the eastern Mediterranean, and Mesopotamia, for which we have reliable
records, can be compared in this respect with the same regions of today.

Earthquakes in Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome are described or mentioned by many classic
authors. For the purpose of comparison with the earth-tremor activity of the present day, it is
enough to point to fifty-seven earthquakes reported in Rome in a single year17 during the Punic
wars (—217).
If our interpretation of the cause of earthquakes is correct, then not only must more tremors and
stronger shocks have been experienced in olden times, but also their cause must have been
known to the ancients.
Pliny wrote: 'The theory of the Babylonians deems that even earthquakes and fissures in the
ground are caused by the force of the stars that is the cause of all other phenomena, but only by
that of those three stars (planets) to which they assign thunderbolts."18

CHAPTER 5
The Steeds of Mars
' I 'HE CASE of Abraham Rockenbach and David Herlicius, who * wrote about the year 1600,
and who were informed on the matter of the comets of antiquity,1 shows that the contents of
some old manuscripts were known to the scholarly world then, though not to modent scholars.
A scholar and pamphleteer, Jonathan Swift, in his Gulliver's Travels (1726), wrote that the planet
Mars had two satellites, very small ones. "Certain astrologers . . . have likewise discovered two
lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars, whereof the innermost is distant from the
center of the primary planet exactly three of its diameters, and the outermost five; the former
revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one and a half . . . which evidently
shews them to be governed by the same law of gravitation, that influences the other heavenly
bodies."2
Actually Mars has two satellites, mere rocks, one being as small as about ten (?) miles in
diameter, the other only five (?) miles.8 One travels around Mars in 7 hours 39 minutes, the
other in 30 hours 18 minutes. Their distance from the center of Mars is even less than Swift said
it was.4 They were discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877. With

planet's center less than one and a half diameters of the planet).

the optical instruments of the days of Swift, they could not have been seen, and neither Newton
nor Halley, the contemporaries of Swift, nor William Herschel in the eighteenth or Leverrier in
the nineteenth century suspected their existence.5 It was bold of Swift to assume their very short
periods of revolution (months), measured only in hours; it was a very rare coincidence, indeed, if
Swift invented these satellites, guessing correctly not only their existence, but also their number
(two), and especially their very short revolutions. This passage of Swift aroused the literary
critics' wonder.
It is an even chance that Swift invented the two satellites of Mars and thus by a rare accident
came close to the truth. But it may also have been that Swift had read about the trabants in some
text not known to us or to his contemporaries. The fact is that Homer knew about the "two steeds
of Mars" that drew his chariot; Virgil also wrote about them.6
When Mars was very close to the earth, its two trabants were visible. They rushed in front of and
around Mars; in the disturbances that took place, they probably snatched some of Mars'
atmosphere, dispersed as it was, and appeared with gleaming manes.7 The steeds were yoked
when Mars (Ares) prepared to descend to the earth on a punitive expedition.

robin-bobin

When Asaph Hall discovered the satellites, he gave them the names of Phobos (Terror) and
Deimos (Rout), the two steeds of Mars; 8 without fully realizing what he did, he gave the
satellites the same names by which they were known to the ancients.
Whether or not Swift borrowed his knowledge of the existence of two trabants of Mars from
some ancient astrological work, the ancient poets knew of the existence of the satellites of Mars.

The Terrible Ones
Venus had a tail, considerably shortened since the time it was a comet, but still long enough to
give the impression of a hanging flame, or smoke, or attached hair. When Mars clashed with
Venus, asteroids,1 meteorites, and gases were torn from this trailing part, and began a semiindependent existence, some following the orbit of Mars, some other paths.
These swarms of meteorites with their gaseous appendages were newborn comets; flying in
bands and taking various shapes, they made an uncanny impression. Those which followed Mars
closely looked like a troop following their leader. They also ran along different orbits, grew
quickly from small to giant size, and terrorized the peoples of the earth. And when, soon after the
impact of Venus and Mars, Mars began to threaten the earth, the new comets, running very close
to the earth, added to the terror, continually recalling the hour of peril.
Ares of Homer, going into battle, is accompanied by never resting horrible creatures, Terror,
Rout, and Discord. Terror and Rout yoke the gleaming horses of Ares, themselves dreadful
beasts, also known by these names; Discord, "sister and comrade of man-slaying Ares, rageth
incessantly; she at the first rears her crest but little, yet thereafter planteth her head in heaven,
while her feet tread on earth."
Similarly, the Babylonians saw the planet Mars-Nergal in the company of demons, and wrote in
their hymns to Nergal: 2 "Great giants, raging demons, with awesome members, run at his right
and at his left." These "raging demons" are pictured also in the Nergal-Eriskigal poem; 3 they
bring pestilence and cause earthquakes.
It appears that the mythological figures of the Furies of the Latins or the Erinyes of the Greeks,
with serpents winding about their heads
1 Between Mars and Jupiter are over a thousand asteroids that have been thought to have once
been a planet. G. A. Atwater queries whether they could have resulted from the encounter
between Mars and Venus.

and arms, flashing flame with their eyes, swinging torches around like wheels, grew out of the

To these comets, traveling in bands with Mars or Indra, are dedicated many Vedic hymns, indeed
a great part of them. They are called Maruts "shining like snakes," "blazing in their strength,"
"brilliant like fires." •

strong and giver of victory.7
And it is said that their "strength is like the vigor of their father."

Meteorites, when entering the earth's atmosphere, make a frightful din. So did the Maruts:
Even by day the Maruts create darkness. . . . Then from the shouting of the Maruts over the
whole space of the Earth, men reeled forward.11
This darkness and this din were narrated in scriptural and rabbinical sources, in Roman
traditions, and in hymns to Nergal. As the similarity of the description of the "terrible ones" in
the Vedic hymns and in Joel is striking, but has not been noticed, a few more quotations should
follow here.
The comets, just beginning to whirl, looked like revolving torches or writhing snakes; they
assumed the form of spinning wheels, and the celestial phantasmagoria appeared like swift
chariots; changing their forms, the Maruts looked like horses racing along the sky, and then
again like a host of warriors, leaping, climbing, irresistible.
The verses of the second chapter of Joel (2 : 2-11) are given in their order, interspersed with
verses taken from a number of Vedic hymns dedicated to the Maruts.

Joel describes how these warriors, coming with fire and clouds, will run upon the wall, enter in
at the windows, run to and fro in the city, and the sword can do them no harm. In similar terms
the Vedic hymns describe the conquest by this terrible host.
If there is any doubt as to the nature of the "terrible ones," the following words should dissipate
it:
Joel 2 : 10
The earth shall quake before them;
the heavens shall tremble; the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their

Maruts are often called "shakers of heaven and earth." Vedic Hymns You shake the sky.

ning horses, marching warriors; the trembling of the earth, the reeling of the firmament, were
visualized, felt, and feared on the shores of both the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, for
they were not local disturbances, but displays of cosmic forces in cosmic dimensions. Joel did
not copy from the Vedas nor the Vedas from Joel. In more than this one instance it is possible to
show that peoples, separated even by broad oceans, have described some spectacle in similar
terms. These were pageants, projected against the celestial screen, that, a few hours after they
were seen in India, appeared over Nineveh, Jerusalem, and Athens, shortly thereafter over Rome
and Scandinavia, and a few hours later over the lands of the Mayas and Incas.
The spectators saw in the celestial prodigies either demons, as the Erinyes of the Greeks or the
Furies of the Latins, or gods whom they invoked in prayers, as in the Vedas of the Hindus, or the
executors of the Lord's wrath, as in Joel and Isaiah.
In the Section "Isaiah" we maintained that the army of the Lord was not the Assyrian host, but a
celestial host. Isaiah called the army of the Most High "the terrible ones."
And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far,
and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth:
and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
None shall be weary nor stumble among them;
none shall slumber nor sleep;
neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,
nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent,
their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint,
and their wheels like a whirlwind.

The Maruts are often called "the terrible ones," the same term Isaiah used. "The terrible ones" of
the Vedas were not common storm clouds, nor were the "terrible ones" of Joel and Isaiah human
beings. Certainly only by chance did the similarity of names and pictures in the Vedas and the
Prophets escape the attention of students of religion.
The Maruts are understood here as comets which in great numbers started to whirl in the sky on
short orbits, after the impact of Mars and Venus. They followed and preceded the planet Mars.
The name Mars (genitive, Martis) would be of the same origin as Marut. It is therefore gratifying
to read that the philological relation has already been established.28 It is even more satisfactory
that this philological equation was made without knowledge of the actual relation between the
planet Mars and "the terrible ones."
By comparing Hebrew historical, Chinese astronomical, and Latin ecclesiastical material, we
have established that it was the planet Mars which caused a series of catastrophes in the eighth
and seventh centuries before this era. The Greek epos explained how it happened that Venus
ceased and Mars began to be a threat to the earth. In heavenly battles, Ares or Nergal, both
known as the planet Mars, had an entourage of demoniac figures. The name Mars is derived
from the Indian Marut; Maruts, "the terrible ones," are "the terrible ones" of Isaiah and Joel.
The origin of the Greek name Ares was debated by philologists,29 and reasons against a
common root with the identical Mars were admitted. It seems to me that just as Mars is derived
from Marut, "the terrible ones" of the Vedas, so Ares was formed from the "terrible one" of the
Hebrew, which, as used by Joel and Isaiah, is ariz.
In a no longer extant passage of Pliny there was something said about comets being produced by
planets.30 Also the Soochow Chart
28 "Why should we object to Mars, Martis as a parallel form of Maruts? I do not say the two
words are identical, I only maintain that the root is the same. . . . If there could be any doubt as to
the original identity of Marut and Mars, it is dispelled by the Umbrian name cerfo Martio, which,
as Grassmann (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XVI, 190, etc.) has shown, corresponds exactly to the
expression sardha-s maruta-s, the host of the Maruts. Such minute coincidences can hardly be
accidental." F. Max Miiller, Vedic Hymns (1891), I, xxv. » Ibid., p. xxvi. so Cf. PaulyWissowa, Real-Encyclopadie, Vol. XI, Col. 1156.

refers to occasions in the past when comets were born from planets, from Mars, Venus, and
others.
Samples from the Planets
In the Vedic hymns the Maruts are implored to "be far from us and far the stone which you hurl."
When comets pass close to the earth, stones occasionally fall; the classic case is that of the
meteorite that fell at Aegospotami when a comet shone in the sky.1 The Hindu book of
Varahasanhita sees in the meteorites portents of devastation by fire and earthquake.2
Since the planets were gods, stones hurled by them or by the comets created in their encounters,
were feared as divine missiles,3 and when they fell and were found, they were worshiped.
The stone of Cronus at Delphi,4 the image of Diana at Ephesus, which, according to Acts (19 :
35), was the image which fell down from Jupiter, the stones of Amon and Seth at Thebes,5 were
meteorites. Also the image of Venus on Cyprus was a stone which fell from the sky.6 The

Palladium of Troy was a stone that fell on the earth "from Pallas Athene" 7 (the planet Venus).
The sacred stone of Tyre, too, was a meteorite related to Astarte, the planet Venus. "Traveling
about the world, she [Astarte] found a star falling from air, or sky, which she taking up,
consecrated on the holy island [Tyre]."8 At Aphaca in Syria a meteorite fell which "was thought
to be Astarte herself," and a temple to Astarte was built there; festivals "were regu1 Aristotle Meteorologica i. 7.

larly timed to coincide with the appearance of Venus as the Morning or Evening Star." 9
The stone on which the Temple of Solomon was built—Eben Shetiya, or fire stone—is a bolide
that fell in the beginning of the tenth century, in the time of David, when a comet, which bore the
appearance of a man with a sword, was seen in the sky.10 The sacred shield of Numa at Rome,
the ancile of Roman Mars, was a bolide; it fell from the sky n in the beginning of the seventh
century and its origin was connected with Mars.
In the years when the planet Mars had long been pacified, its position was still watched when
meteorites fell. Thus the Chinese wrote in —211: "The planet Mars being in the neighborhood of
Antares, a star fell at Toung-Kiun, and arriving to the ground, it changed to a stone."12 The
people of the place cut a prophecy of evil for the emperor on the stone, and the emperor had it
destroyed. Carving messages to peoples or kings on fallen stones was known before and has
been practiced since.
One of the stones that fell from the sky is still worshiped today—it is the black stone of Kaaba in
Mecca. Now its surface is black from being touched and kissed innumerable times, but under its
cover of dirt it retains its original reddish color. It is the holiest thing in Mecca, built into the wall
of Kaaba, and pilgrims travel thousands of miles to kiss it.
Kaaba is older than Mohammedanism. Mohammed, in the early part of his career, worshiped
Venus (al-Uzza) and other planetary gods, which even today enjoy great veneration among the
Moslems as the "daughters of the god." 13

the planet Venus;14 but another legend says that it was brought down by the Archangel
Gabriel.15 Granted that this legend may conceal some information about the origin of the stone,
we ought to ask ourselves: Who is the Archangel Gabriel?
The Archangels
In the Scriptures the destruction of the army of Sennacherib is said to have been caused by a
"blast," and a few verses later it is said to have been the act of an angel of God.1 The Talmudic

robin-bobin

and Midrashic sources, which relate that the army of Sennacherib was destroyed by a blast and
scourge accompanied by a terrible din on the night following the day when the shadow of the sun
returned ten degrees, are more specific: the scourge was inflicted by the Archangel Gabriel "in
the guise of a column of fire."2 In the present research it has been established that it was the
work of Mars.
Are archangels planets? "An old tradition, dating back to Gaonic times, had it that there are
seven archangels, each of whom is associated with a planet." 3 "The seven archangels were
believed to play an important part in the universal order through their association with the
planets and the constellations. There is some variation, in the different versions, in the angels
assigned to the planets." * In some medieval writings Gabriel is associated with the moon, but in
one or two with Mars.5 The following, however, makes the identification of Gabriel possible:
Gabriel is connected with the foundation of Rome. The Jewish legend says that when Solomon
took the daughter of Pharaoh to wife, "the Archangel Gabriel descended from heaven and
inserted a reed in the sea. About this reed more and more earth was gradually deposited, and, on
the day on which Jeroboam erected the golden calves, a little hut was built on the island. This

dwelling-place of Rome." e Here Gabriel is cast in the role the Romans ascribed to Mars, that of
the founder of Rome.7 Our assumption that it was the planet Mars which caused the destruction
of the army of Sennacherib in the spring of —687 is implied also by rabbinical sources: Since
the Archangel Gabriel is another name for the planet Mars, the ancient Jews knew the origin of
the "blast" and the identity of "the angel of the Lord" who destroyed the Assyrian army.
Gabriel is the angel appointed over fire; he is also, according to Origen,8 the angel of war. Thus
we again recognize in him Mars-Nergal. The rabbinical tradition says that the Assyrians of the
host of Sennacherib, before they died, were permitted by Gabriel to hear "the song of the
celestials," which can be interpreted as the sound caused by a close approach of the planet. The
words of Isaiah (33 : 3), "at the noise of the tumult [hamon] the people fled," should, according
to the Jewish tradition as related by Jerome, refer to Gabriel, Hamon being another of his
names.9
The planet Mars is red, and Maadim (the red or the one who reddens) is the name for Mars in the
Hebrew astronomical texts. One text says: "The Holy One created Mars—Maadim—that he
should throw them [the nations] down into hell."10
A few rabbinical sources attribute the destruction of Sennacherib's army to the action of the
Archangel Michael; some ascribe it to both archangels.11 Who, then, is the Archangel Michael?

Angel of God. According to the Midrash,12 it was the Archangel Michael who made himself "a
wall of fire" between the Israelites and the Egyptians. Michael is said to be made of fire. The
Haggadah states: "Michael was appointed High Priest of the celestial sanctuary at the same time
that Aaron was made high priest of Israel," that is, in the time of the Exodus. Michael was also
the angel who appeared to Joshua, son of Nun.
The celestial struggle at the Sea of Passage is depicted in the familiar image of the Archangel
Michael slaying the dragon. Michael produces fire by touching the earth, and it was the
emanation of this archangel that was seen in the burning bush. He has his abode in heaven and is
the forerunner of Shehina or God's presence, but as Lucifer, Michael falls from heaven and his
hands are bound by God. All these attributes and acts of the Archangel Michael13 lead us to
recognize which planet he represents: it is Venus.
The Archangel Michael, or the planet Venus, and the Archangel Gabriel, or the planet Mars,
saved the people of Israel on two dramatic occasions. At the Sea of Passage, when the hosts of
Egypt, pursuing the fleeing slaves, could be seen in the distance ("the children of Israel lifted up
their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid" 14), the sea
was torn apart, and the slaves walked on the bottom of the sea and reached the other shore. Their
enemies were thrown high by the released tides, which fell down when a spark passed between
Venus and the earth.
Eight hundred years passed after the Exodus. The Assyrian hosts, which a generation earlier had
removed the Ten Tribes of Israel to an exile from whence they never returned, invaded Judea
with the express purpose of crushing rebellious Judah and removing him from his homeland and
from the scene of history. A blast from the planet Mars fell upon the camp of the Assyrians and
annihilated it. Those rabbinical sources which ascribed this act to both archangels were

not wrong. Venus pushed Mars toward the earth, and thus both were instrumental in the
destruction.
The author of the apocryphal book of the Ascension [Assumption] of Moses knew that "Venus
and Mars are each as large as the whole Earth."15
Because of their intervention at moments when the national existence of Israel was at stake,
Michael and Gabriel were looked upon as "guardian angels" of the eternal people.
Gabriel is the Hebrew Hercules (Heracles). Actually the classic authors made it clear that
Hercules is another name for the planet Mars.18 In the Gospel of Luke (1 : 26) Gabriel is the
angel of Annunciation to the Virgin.
In the Roman Catholic Church Michael is the conqueror of Satan, "head of the host of heaven
and first of the saints after Mary."
Planet Worship in Judea in the Seventh Century
In the Northern Kingdom the process of disassociating the deity from the celestial object had not
yet been completed when the Kingdom was destroyed (—723 or —722), and its population was
led away into captivity, from which they did not return. "And they [the tribes of the Northern
Kingdom] left all the commandments of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, even
two calves, and made a grove, and worshiped all the host of heaven and served Baal" (II Kings
17 : 16).
Only a few years after the deliverance of Judea from the hand of Sennacherib, Manasseh, son of
Hezekiah, "built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord" (II
Kings 21 : 5). "For he [Manasseh] built again high places which Hezekiah his father had broken
down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and he made groves, and worshipped all the host of
heaven, and served them" (II Chronicles 33 : 3).

It was in the time of Josiah, grandson of Manasseh, and shortly before the exile of Judah to
Babylon, that a pure monotheism emerged as an outcome of the progress the Jewish people had
made during its long struggle for national existence, on the one hand, and for purification of its
concept of God, on the other. "And the king [Josiah] commanded Hilkiah the High Priest ... to
bring forth out of the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal and for the
grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of
Kidron, and carried the ashes of them into Bethel. And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom
the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in
the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the
moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven" (II Kings 23 : 4-5).
The Scriptures do not hide the fact that in Judea, as well as in Israel, the planetary cult was the
official cult with the priests and with kings, with many prophets and with the people. Thus
Jeremiah, contemporary of King Josiah, says: "At that time, saith the Lord, they shall bring out
the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the
bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves: and they
shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have
loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have
sought, and whom they have worshipped" (Jeremiah 8 : 1-2). And again he says: "And the
houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of
Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of
heaven" (Jeremiah 19 : 13).
In the days of Jeremiah and King Josiah, a scroll was found in a chamber of the Temple (II
Kings 22). It is generally thought that it was the book of Deuteronomy, the last book of the
Pentateuch. The text of the scroll made a strong impression on the king.
"And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the
stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which
the
296
WORLDS IN COLLISION
Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven" (Deuteronomy 4 : 19).
"Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven
above, or that is in the earth beneath . . ." (5:8), which is a passage of the Decalogue (Exodus 20 :
4) verbatim.
"If there be found among you . . . man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness . . . and hath
gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of
heaven, which I have not commanded . . . then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman . . .
and shall stone them with stones, till they die" (17: 2^5).
Thus we see the centuries-long struggle for the Jewish God, Creator and not unanimated planet,
itself a creation, being carried on in the closing decades before the exile to Babylon with the help
of the book whose authorship was ascribed to Moses.
When the people of Jerusalem were exiled to Babylon, and groups of refugees succeeded in
escaping to Egypt, taking with them Jeremiah, they said to him: "But we will certainly . . . burn
our incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done,
we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of
Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals and were well, and saw no evil. But since we left
off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have

robin-bobin

wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine" (Jeremiah 44 : 1718).
It is apparent from this passage that the population of Jerusalem that sought refuge in Egypt
thought the national catastrophe fell upon their people, not because they had left the Lord God,
but because in the days of Josiah and his sons they had ceased to worship the planetary gods of
Manasseh and especially the Queen of Heaven, the planet Venus.
Of this remnant of the people that went to Egypt in the beginning of the sixth century a military
colony was established in Ebb (Elephantine) in southern Egypt. Documents (papyri) of this
colony were unearthed in the beginning of this century. The Jewish colony
WORLDS IN COLLISION
297
in Elephantine faithfully worshipped Yahu (Yahwe), the Lord of the sky, as the theophoric
names of many members of the colony testify. Scholars were puzzled, however, to find on one of
the papyri the name Anat-Yahu; they were uncertain whether it belonged to a goddess or a place
or a person. "Anat is the familiar name of the Canaanite goddess identified with Athene in a
Cyprian inscription." * The historical facts revealed in the present research make the
understanding of such cult easier. The dark tradition that it was the planet Venus that played such
an important role in the days when the forebears of these refugees in Egypt left that land and
passed through cataclysms of fire and water, sea and desert, was responsible for this syncretism
of names.
The Jewish people did not obtain all of its "supremacy" 2 in that one day at the Mountain of
Lawgiving; this people did not receive the message of monotheism as a gift. It struggled for it;
and step by step, from the smoke rising from the overturned valley of Sodom and Gomorrah,
from the furnace of affliction of Egypt, from the deliverance at the Red Sea amid the sky-high
tides, from the wandering in the cloud-enshrouded desert burning with naphtha, from the internal
struggle, from the search for God and for justice between man and man, from the desperate and
heroic struggle for national existence on its narrow strip of land against the overwhelming
empires of Assyria and Egypt, it became a nation chosen to bring a message of the brotherhood
of man to all the peoples of the world.

CHAPTER 6
A Collective Amnesia
At any rate they seem to have been strangely forgetful of the catastrophe. —Plato, Laws iii
(transl. R. Bury)
IT IS an established fact in the learning about the human mind that the most terrifying events of
childhood (in some cases even of manhood) are often forgotten, their memory blotted out from
consciousness and displaced into the unconscious strata of the mind, where they continue to live
and to express themselves in bizarre forms of fear. Occasionally they may be converted into
symptoms of compulsion neuroses and even contribute to the splitting of the personality.
One of the most terrifying events in the past of mankind was the conflagration of the world,
accompanied by awful apparitions in the sky, quaking of the earth, vomiting of lava by
thousands of volcanoes, melting of the ground, boiling of the sea, submersion of continents, a
primeval chaos bombarded by flying hot stones, the roaring of the cleft earth, and the loud
hissing of tornadoes of cinders.
There occurred more than one world conflagration; the most horrible one was in the days of the
Exodus. In hundreds of passages in their Bible, the Hebrews described what happened.
Returning from the Babylonian exile in the sixth and fifth centuries before this era, the Hebrews
did not cease to learn and repeat the traditions, but they lost sight of the fearful reality of what
they learned. Apparently,
298
WORLDS IN COLLISION
299

robin-bobin

the post-Exile generations looked upon all these descriptions as the poetical utterances of
religious literature.
The talmudists in the beginning of this era disputed whether a deluge of fire, prophesied in old
traditions, would take place or not; those who denied that it might come, based their argument on
the divine promise found in the Book of Genesis, that the Deluge would not be repeated; those
who argued to the contrary, reasoning that though the deluge of water would not recur, there
might come a deluge of fire, were attacked for construing too narrowly the promise of the Lord.1
Both sides overlooked the most prominent part of their traditions: the history of the Exodus and
all the passages about the cosmic catastrophe, endlessly repeated in Exodus, Numbers, and the
Prophets, and in the rest of the Scriptures.
The Egyptians in the sixth pre-Christian century knew about the catastrophes that overwhelmed
other countries. Plato narrates the story which Solon heard in Egypt about the world destroyed in
deluges and conflagrations: "You remember but one deluge, though many catastrophes had
occurred previously." The Egyptian priests who said this and who maintained that their land was
spared on these occasions, forgot what happened to Egypt. When, in the Ptolemaic age, the priest
Manetho starts his story of the invasion of the Hyksos by acknowledging his ignorance of the
cause and nature of the blast of heavenly displeasure that befell his land, it becomes apparent that
the knowledge which was possibly alive in Egypt in the days when Solon and Pythagoras visited
there, had already sunk into oblivion in the Ptolemaic age. Only some hazy tradition about a
conflagration of the world was repeated, without knowing when or how it occurred.
The Egyptian priest, described by Plato as conversing with Solon, supposed that the memory of
the catastrophes of fire and flood had been lost because literate men perished in them, together
with all the achievements of their culture, and these upheavals "escaped your notice because for
many generations the survivors died with no power to express themselves in writing." 2 A
similar argument is found in
> Cf. Ginzberg, "Mabul shel esh" in Ha-goren, VIII, 35-51. 2 Plato, Timaeus 23 C.

WORLDS IN COLLISION
Philo the Alexandrian, who wrote in the first century of this era: "By reason of the constant and
repeated destructions of water and fire, the later generations did not receive from the former the
memory of the order and sequence of events." 3
Although Philo knew about the repeated destructions of the world by water and fire, it did not
occur to him that a catastrophe of conflagration was described in the Book of Exodus. Nor did he
think that anything of this sort took place in the days of Joshua or even of Isaiah. He thought that
the Book of Genesis comprised the story of "how fire and water wrought great destruction of
what is on the earth," and that the destruction by fire, about which he knew from the teachings of
the Greek philosophers, was identical with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
The memory of the cataclysms was erased, not because of lack of written traditions, but because
of some characteristic process that later caused entire nations, together with their literate men, to
read into these traditions allegories or metaphors where actually cosmic disturbances were
clearly described.
It is a psychological phenomenon in the life of individuals as well as whole nations that the most
terrifying events of the past may be forgotten or displaced into the subconscious mind. As if
obliterated are impressions that should be unforgettable. To uncover their vestiges and their
distorted equivalents in the physical life of peoples is a task not unlike that of overcoming
amnesia in a single person.
Folklore
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor
language, where their voice is not heard.
—Psalms 19:2-3
The scholars who dedicate their efforts to gathering and investigating the folklore of peoples are
constantly aware that folk tales require interpretation, for, in their opinion, these tales are not

cent and unambiguous products of the imagination, but veil some inner and more significant
meaning.
The legends of classic peoples, first among them the Greeks, also belong to folklore. As early as
pre-Christian times these legends were subjected to interpretation, many interpreters recognizing
the symbolic character of mythology.
With Macrobius in the fourth Christian century, there begins a tendency to see in many gods of
Egyptian and Greek antiquity the personification of the sun. Macrobius compared Osiris to the
sun, and Isis to the moon, disregarding the opinion of earlier authors. He also interpreted Jupiter
as the sun.
As the role the planets played in the history of the world retreated ever further into oblivion, the
interpretation of nature myths as referring to the sun or the moon became more and more
widespread. In the nineteenth century it was the vogue to explain the old myths as inspired by
the movement of the sun and the moon, during the day, night, month, and year. Not only Ra,
Amon, Marduk, Phaethon, and even Zeus,1 but also king-heroes, like Oedipus, became solar
symbols.2
This exclusive role of sun and moon in mythology is a reflection of their significance in nature.
However, in former times the planets played a decidedly more important role in the imagination
of peoples, to which fact their religions give testimony. True, sun and moon (Shamash and Sin,
Helios, Apollo, and Selene) were also numbered among the planet-gods, but usually they were
not the most important ones. Their enumeration among the seven planets sometimes startles the
modern scholar, because these two luminaries are so much more conspicuous than the other
planets; the dominance of Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, and Mars must startle us even more as long as
we do not know what was displayed on the celestial scene a few thousand years ago.
Modern folklorists occupy themselves mainly with the folklore of primitive peoples, material
unspoiled by generations of copyists and

2 In a separate work I intend to trace the historical prototype of the legend of Oedipus Rex.
302
WORLDS IN COLLISION
interpreters. Being received at its source, it is supposed to shed light not only on the mentality of
these primitive peoples, but also on many problems of sociology and psychology in general.
The sociological method explores mythology for evidence of social usages. Folklorists like
James Frazer expended their efforts on this aspect. Freud, the psychologist, centered his attention
on the motif of father-murder (patricide), presenting it as though it had been a regular institution
in ancient times. He makes it appear a general practice in the past and a subconscious urge in
present-day man.
However, regular institutions and practices in the life of the family would not give rise to myths.
A writer on this subject has correctly pointed out this fact: "What is quite normal in nature and
society rarely excites the myth-making imagination which is more likely to be kindled by the
abnormal, some startling catastrophe, some terrible violation of the social code." 3
Even less than daily tribal life do the daily occurrences in nature give rise to legends. The sun
rises every morning, it travels from east to west; the moon enters a new phase four times a
month; the year has four seasons—such regular changes do not stir the imagination of peoples,
because they contain nothing unexpected in themselves. Daily things do not evoke astonishment
and influence but little a people's creative faculty. Sunrise and sunset, morning dew and evening
mist, are common experiences, and if a single spectacle impresses itself upon us in the course of
life, the many sunrises and the many sunsets in our memory pale and each looks like the other.
Seasonal snowstorms or thunderstorms do not leave indelible memories. Only striking,
perturbing experiences of a social or physical order are designed to stir the imagination of
peoples. Seneca says: "It is for this very reason that the assembly of stars that lends beauty to the

robin-bobin

immense firmament does not compel the attention of the masses; but when a change occurs in
the order of the universe, all looks are fixed on the sky." *
Even local catastrophes, regarded as very violent, do not serve for

Academy, 1919-1920, p. 47. 4 Naturales quaestiones vii.
WORLDS IN COLLISION
303
the creation of cosmic myths. First in power to impress the races of the earth are the cataclysms
of the past, and on this we have dwelt at length. Comets, because of their causal relation to world
catastrophes, and also because of their terrifying appearance, were the kind of phenomenon to
kindle the imagination of peoples. But for some reason, the impression they must have made on
the peoples of antiquity is not considered in explanation of myths and legends.
Since the invention of the printing press, the great agitation and mass hysteria caused by the
more brilliant comets can be traced in contemporary books and pamphlets. Were the ancients
immune to these feelings? If not, then why are the exegetes of the Bible and the commentators
on the epic compositions of antiquity so remiss as not to think of phenomena that could not but
impress the ancients? Or did no comets appear in the sky during ancient times? This, of course,
is only a rhetorical question.
Keeping this in mind, we shall be able to answer the question about the striking similarity of
certain concepts among peoples of different cultures, sometimes separated by oceans.
Of "Pre-existing Ideas" in the Souls of Peoples
The similarity of motifs in the folklore of various peoples on the five continents and on the
islands of the oceans posed a difficult problem for the ethnologists and anthropologists. The
migration of ideas may follow the migration of peoples, but how could unusual motifs of
folklore reach isolated islands where the aborigines do not have any means of crossing the sea?
And why did not technical civilization travel together with spiritual? Peoples still living in the
stone age possess the same, often strange, motifs as the cultured nations. The particular character
of some of the contents of folklore makes it impossible to assume that it was only by mere
chance that the same motifs were created in all corners of the world. The problem is so
perplexing to the scientists that, for lack of a better proposition, an explanation was offered
according to which the motifs of folklore are a pre-existing possession in the soul of peoples;
peoples are born with these ideas just as an animal is born with an urge to propagate
304
WORLDS IN COLLISION
its kind, to nurse its offspring, to build a lair or a nest, and to travel in herds or migrate in flocks
to far-away countries. But it is not so simple to explain in these terms why, for instance, the
aborigines of America imagined a witch as a woman riding on a broom across the sky, exactly as
the European peoples imagined her. "The Mexican witch, like her European sister, carried a
broom on which she rode through the air, and was associated with the screech owl. Indeed, the
queen of witches, Tlagoltiotl, is depicted as riding on a broom and as wearing the witch's peaked
hat." ' As with the witch on her broom, so also with hundreds of other odd fantasies and beliefs.
The answer to the problem of the similarity of the motifs in the folklore of various peoples is, in
my view, as follows: A great many ideas reflect real historical content. There is a legend, found
all over the world, that a deluge swept over the earth and covered hills and even mountains. We
have a poor opinion of the mental abilities of our ancestors if we think that merely an
extraordinary overflow of the Euphrates so impressed the nomads of the desert that they thought
the entire world was flooded, and that the legend so born wandered from people to people. At the
same time, geological problems of the origin and distribution of till, or diluvial deposit, are
awaiting explanation.
The peoples of ancient times, who, like the primitive peoples of the present, lacked modern
protection against the elements of nature, and who lived in the insecurity of tropical storms and
tornadoes or frost and snowstorms, must have been more accustomed to seasonal disturbances
than we are, and would not have been impressed by the overflow of a river to such a degree as to
carry their experience to all parts of the world as a story of a cosmic upheaval.

robin-bobin

Traditions about upheavals and catastrophes, found among all peoples, are generally discredited
because of the shortsighted belief that no forces could have shaped the world in the past that are
not at work also at the present time, a belief that is the very foundation of modern geology and of
the theory of evolution. "Present continuity implies the improbability of past catastrophism and
violence of change, either in the lifeless or in the living world; moreover, we seek to interpret 1
Lewis Spence, The History of Atlantis (1930), p. 224.
WORLDS IN COLLISION
305
the changes and laws of past time through those which we observe at the present time. This was
Darwin's secret, learned from Lyell." 2 It has been shown in this book, however, that forces
which at present do not act on the earth, did so act in historical times, and that these forces are of
a purely physical character. Scientific principles do not warrant maintaining that a force which
does not act now, could not have acted previously. Or must we be in permanent collision with
the planets and comets in order to believe in such catastrophes?
The Pageants of the Sky
Cosmic perturbations took place, catastrophes swept the globe, but did witches fly through the
air on brooms? The reader would agree that cosmic catastrophes, if they occurred, could leave,
and must have left, similar memories all around the world; but there are fantastic images that do
not appear to represent realities. We shall follow this rule: if there exists a fantastic image that is
projected against the sky and that repeats itself all around the world, it is most probably an image
that was seen on the screen of the sky by many peoples at the same time. On one occasion a
comet took the striking form of a woman riding on a broom, and the celestial picture was so
clearly defined that the same impression was imposed on all the peoples of the world. It is well
known how, in modern times, the forms of comets impress people. One comet was said to look
like "un crucifix tout sanglant," another like a sword; actually every comet has its peculiar shape
which may also change during the visibility of the comet.
To illustrate what is said here by another example, it may be asked: What induced the Mayas to
call by the name of Scorpion the constellation known to us and to the ancients by the same
name? 1 The outlines of this constellation do not resemble the shape of this insect. It is "one of
the most remarkable coincidences in nomenclature." 2
2H. F. Osborn, The Origin and Evolution of Life (1918), p. 24.
1 Sahagun, in the fourth chapter of the seventh book of his historical work, says that the people
of Mexico called the constellation Scorpion (Scorpio) by this very same name.
2 Seler, Ges. Ahhand. zur amer. Sprach- und Alterthumskunde, II (1903), 622. His surmise,
disagreeing with the assertion of De Sahagun, was that Scorpion
306
WORLDS IN COLLISION
The constellation, which is not at all like a scorpion, probably was called by this name because a
comet that looked like a scorpion appeared in it. Actually, we read on one of the Babylonian
astronomical tablets that "a star flared up and its light radiated bright as day, and as it blazed, it
lashed its tail like an angry scorpion." 3 If it was not this particular appearance of a comet that
caused the constellation to be called Scorpion, there must have been a similar occurrence on
another date.
Another example is the dragon. All around the world this image is prominent in literature and art
and also in the religion of peoples. There is probably no nation that does not use this symbol or
this creature as an important motif, yet it does not exist. Several scholars thought that possibly it
represented some extinct menace that impressed mankind to a much greater degree than any
other creature since it appears on the Chinese flag, and in pictures showing Archangel Michael
or St. George in battle with it, in Egyptian mythology, in Mexican hieroglyphics and bas-reliefs,
and in Assyrian bas-reliefs. However, bones of this presumably extinct reptile have not been
found.
From the description of the comet Typhon that spread like an animal over the sky with its many
heads and winged body, with fire flaming from its mouths, as described in a previous chapter by
quotations from Apollodorus and others, we recognize the origin of this widespread motif.

The Subjective Interpretation of the Events and Their Authenticity
What helped to discredit the traditions of the peoples about the catastrophes was their subjective
and magical interpretation of the events. The sea was torn apart. The people attributed this act to
the intervention of their leader; he lifted his staff over the waters and they divided. Of course,
there is no person who can do this, and no staff with which it can be done. Likewise in the case
of Joshua who comof the ancients was more to the south. However, with the displacement of the poles, the stars
acquired new positions.

307
manded the sun and the moon to halt in their movements. Because the scientific mind cannot
believe that a man can make the sun and the moon to stand still, it disbelieves also the alleged
event. What contributes to this is the fact that least of all do we place faith in books that demand
belief, religious books, though we swear on these.
The peoples of the past were prepared to see miracles in unusual occurrences; for this reason
modern man, who does not believe in miracles, rejects the event together with the interpretation.
But as we find the same event in the traditions of many peoples, and as each people has
differently comprehended it, its historicity can be checked, and this in addition to the control
offered by natural science. For example, if the geographical poles changed their location, or the
axis its inclination, the ancient solar clock would not show the correct time; or, if the magnetic
poles became reversed at some time in the past, the lava of earlier volcanic activity must show
reversed magnetic orientation.
But there is also a check by folklore. Isaiah foretold to King Hezekiah, probably a few hours
before the event, that the shadow of the sundial would return ten degrees. (As we know now, the
planet Mars was at that moment very close to the earth, and Isaiah could make an estimate based
on experiences during previous perturbations of the earth by Mars.) The Chinese explained this
phenomenon as having occurred to help their princes in their strategy, or to settle a quarrel
among them. The Greek people thought the phenomenon was an expression of heavenly wrath at
the crime of the Argive tyrants. The Latins thought the phenomenon was an omen associated
with Romulus, son of Mars. In the Icelandic epos the same event has a different purpose, in the
Finnish epos another, and yet others in Japan and Mexico and Polynesia. The American Indians
say that the sun went backwards several degrees for fear of a boy who tried to snare it or because
of some animal that terrified it. Precisely because there are great differences in the subjective
evaluation of the causes or purposes of the phenomenon, we can assume that the folklore of
different peoples deals with one and the same factual event, and only the magical explanations of
the miracle are subjective inventions. Many accompanying details are preserved in the variants
308

of different peoples, which could not have been invented without an adequate knowledge of the
laws of motion and thermodynamics. It is inconceivable that the ancients or the primitive races
would, for instance, by sheer chance invent the tale that a huge conflagration enveloped the
American prairies and forests as soon as the sun, frightened off by the snarer, returned a little on
its way.
If a phenomenon had been similarly described by many peoples, we might suspect that a tale,
originating with one people, had spread around the world, and consequently there is no proof of
the authenticity of the event related. But just because one and the same event is embodied in
traditions that are very different indeed, its authenticity becomes highly probable, especially if
the records of history, ancient charts, sundials, and the physical evidence of natural history
testify to the same effect.
In the Section "Venus in the Folklore of the Indians" a few illustrations were offered to
illuminate this thesis. In order to illustrate it with additional examples, we choose the naturefolkloristic motif of the sun being arrested in its movement across the firmament in the tales of
the Polynesians, Hawaiians, and North American Indians.

The best known legend cycle on the Pacific islands is that which has for its hero the semigod
Maui.1 This cycle comprises a trilogy: "Of the many exploits of Maui three seem to be most
widely spread: they are fishing up of the land, snaring the sun and the quest of fire."2 There are
two versions of this cycle, one in New Zealand and one in Hawaii, but both are variants of a
common tradition.
The Hawaiian version of the snaring of the sun runs thus: "Maui's mother was much troubled by
the shortness of the day, occasioned by the rapid movement of the sun; and since it was
impossible to dry properly the sheets of tapa used for clothing, the hero resolved to cut off the
legs of the sun, so that he could not travel fast.
"Maui now went off eastward to where the sun climbed daily out of

than those which recount the deeds and adventures of the semi-god Maui. The Maui cycle is one
of the most important for the study of this whole area." Dixon, Oceanic Mythology, p. 41.

the underworld, and as the luminary came up, the hero noosed his legs, one after the other, and
tied the ropes strongly to great trees. Fairly caught, the sun could not get away, and Maui gave
him a tremendous beating with his magic weapon. To save his life, the sun begged for mercy,
and on promising to go more slowly ever after, was released from his bonds."
The "fishing up of islands" or the appearance of new islands took place at the same time; the
causal relation to the cosmic change in the sky is evident. In one of the versions told in Polynesia
about the fishing up of the islands, it is said that a star was used as bait.
The following is a tale told by the Menomini Indians, an Algonquin tribe.3 "The little boy made
a noose and stretched it across the path, and when the Sun came to that point the noose caught
him around the neck and began to choke him until he almost lost his breath. It became dark, and
the Sun called out to the ma'nidos, 'Help me, my brothers, and cut this string before it kills me.'4
The ma'nidos came, but the thread had so cut into the flesh of the Sun's neck that they could not
sever it. When all but one had given up, the Sun called to the Mouse to try to cut the string. The
Mouse came up and gnawed at the string, but it was difficult work, because the string was hot
and deeply imbedded in the Sun's neck. After working at the string a good while, however, the
Mouse succeeded in cutting it, when the Sun breathed again and the darkness disappeared. If the
Mouse had not succeeded, the Sun would have died."
The story about snaring the sun associates itself in our mind with one of the occasions when the
sun was disrupted in its movement across the sky. The story contains an important detail and
enables us to understand a natural phenomenon.
In a previous section we discussed the various versions of the annihilation of Sennacherib's army
and the physical phenomena which caused it. According to the Scriptures, in the days of Isaiah
the sun was interrupted in its course, turning back ten degrees on the

Thompson, Tales of the North American Indians (1929).

sundial. That night the army of Sennacherib was destroyed by a blast. In Egypt this victory over
the common enemy of the Jews and the Egyptians was observed in a festival at Letopolis, "the
city of the thunderbolt"; the holy animal of the city was a mouse, and bronze mice inscribed with
the prayers of pilgrims are found in its soil. Herodotus saw there a statue of a god with a mouse
in his hand, commemorating the annihilation of the army of Sennacherib. The story he heard
gave as the cause of the event an invasion of mice that gnawed the strings of the bows. He also
told the story of the changed movements of the sun directly following the record of the
destruction of the Assyrian army. We recognized that the image of the mouse must have had
some relation to the cosmic drama. The best we could do was to interpret the mouse as a symbol
of a simultaneous plague, exemplified by the illness of King Hezekiah.

robin-bobin

The tale of the Indians that combines the snaring of the sun with the deed of the mouse explains
the relation of these two elements to each other. Apparently the atmosphere of the celestial body
that appeared in the darkness and was illuminated took on the elongated form of a mouse. This
explains why the blast that destroyed the army of Sennacherib was commemorated by the
emblem of a mouse. The Indian tale grew from the picture on the celestial screen where a great
mouse freed the snared sun.
Thus we see how a folk story of the primitives can solve an unsettled problem between Isaiah
and Herodotus.
A four-legged animal in the sky approaching the sun was visualized as a mouse by the Egyptians
and the Menomini Indians. In the tale of the southern Ute Indians, the cottontail is the animal
that is connected with the disruption of the movement of the sun.5 He went to the east with the
intention of breaking the sun in pieces. There he waited for the sun to rise. "The sun began to
rise, but seeing the cottontail, it went down again. Then it rose slowly again and did not notice
the animal. He struck the sun with his club, breaking off a piece, which touched the ground and
set fire to the world.
5R. H. Lowie, "Shoshonean Tales," Journal of American Folk-lore, XXXVII (1924), 61 ff.

"The fire pursued Cottontail, who began to flee. He ran to a log and asked if it would save him if
he got inside. 'No, I burn up entirely.' So he ran again and asked a rock with a cleft in it. 'No, I
cannot save you, when I am heated I burst. ..." At last he got to a river. The river said, 'No, I
cannot save you; I'll boil and you will get boiled.'"
On the plain, Cottontail ran through the weed, but the fire came very close, the weed burned and
fell on his neck, "where cottontails are yellow now."
"From everywhere he saw smoke rising. He walked a little way on the hot ground and one of his
legs was burned up to the knee; before that he had been long-legged. He walked on two legs, and
one of them burned off. He jumped on one till that also burned off."
In this version of the attack on the sun, two points worthy of mention are the world fire following
the disruption in the movement of the sun, and the change in the world of animals accompanied
by strong mutations. In the section, "Phaethon," we wondered how the Roman poet Ovid could
have known of the relation between the interrupted movement of the sun and a world fire unless
such a catastrophe had really occurred. The same reasoning applies to the Indians. The story of
snaring the sun or attacking the sun is told in many variants, but the world fire is a consistent
result. Forests and fields burn, mountains smoke and vomit lava, rivers boil, caves in the
mountains collapse, and rocks burst when the sun peeps above the horizon and then disappears
and again comes over the horizon.
There is one instance more in the Indian story of the sun being impeded on its path and the
ensuing world conflagration. Before the catastrophe, "the sun used to go round close to the
ground." The purpose of the attack on the sun was to make "the sun shine a little longer: The
days are too short." After the catastrophe "the days became longer."
The ancestors of the Shoshonean Indians, a tribe of Utah, Colorado, and Nevada, appear to have
lived in the days of Sennacherib and Hezekiah at such a longitude that the sun was just on the
eastern horizon when it changed its direction and went back and then came up again.
CHAPTER 7
Poles Uprooted
WIAT CHANGES in the motion of earth, moon, and Mars resulted from the contacts in the
eighth and seventh centuries?
The moon, being smaller than Mars, would have been greatly influenced by Mars if it came close
enough to that planet. It could have been drawn nearer to the earth or pulled away to a more
remote orbit. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether, in the time shortly after —687,
reforms of the lunar calendar were undertaken.

robin-bobin

Also, the earth could have been "removed from her place," which would have meant a change in
the orbital circumference and thus in the length of the year, or in the inclination of the terrestrial
axis to the plane of the ecliptic and thus in the seasons, in the position of the poles on the
terrestrial globe, in the velocity of axial rotation, and in the length of the day, and so on. Some of
these changes could be traced if a chart of the sky, drawn in a period prior to —687, could be
examined. Such a chart does exist; it is painted on the ceiling of the tomb of Senmut, the
Egyptian vizier. As explained previously,1 the tomb dates from a time following the Exodus but
before the days of Amos and Isaiah.
The charts of Senmut show the sky over Egypt at two different epochs: one of them depicts the
sky of Egypt before the poles were interchanged probably in the catastrophe that terminated the
Middle Kingdom; the other represents the sky of Egypt in the lifetime of Senmut. The first chart
startled the investigators because in it

313
west and east are reversed. Their judgment of the other chart, in which west and east are not
reversed, is as follows:
"It is surprising to find that the celestial charts which have been preserved until our time did not
correspond to direct observations, nor to the calculations made at the moment of erection of the
monument on which these charts are pictured." 2
Modern astronomy does not admit, or even consider, the possibility that at some historical time
east and west as well as south and north were reversed. Consequently, the first chart could not
have been interpreted at all. The other chart, with its displaced constellations, suggested to the
author of the above quotation that it depicted some more ancient tradition. The only change,
according to modern astronomy, comes from the precession of the equinoxes or the slow
movement of the polar axis which describes a circle in the course of about twenty-six thousand
years. The computation of the precession is insufficient by far to explain the position of the
constellations on the chart if we rely on the conventional chronology (and even more so if we
follow the revised chronology, which brings the age of Senmut and Queen Hatshepsut closer to
modern times).
The changes in the geographical position and cosmic direction of the poles caused by the
catastrophes of the eighth and seventh centuries, as well as those brought about by the
catastrophes of the fifteenth century, can be studied with the help of the astronomical charts of
Senmut.
According to Seneca the Great Bear had been the polar constellation. After a cosmic upheaval
shifted the sky, a star of the Little Bear became the polar star.
Hindu astronomical tablets composed by the Brahmans in the first half of the first millennium
before the present era show a uniform deviation from the expected position of the stars at the
time the observations were made (the precession of the equinoxes being taken
2 A. Pogo, "Astronomie Јgyptienne du tombeau de Senmout," Chronique d'Egypte, 1931.
314

into consideration).3 Modern scholars wondered at this, in their opinion inexplicable, error. In
view of the geometrical methods employed by Hindu astronomy and its detailed method of
calculation, a mistake in observation equal to even a fraction of a degree would be difficult to
account for.
In Jaiminiya-Upanisad-Brahmana it is written that the center of the sky, or the point around
which the firmament revolves, is in the Great Bear.4 This is the same statement we found in
Thyestes of Seneca.
In Egypt, too, "the Great Bear played the part of the Pole Star." 5 "The Great Bear never set."6
Could it be that the precession of equinoxes shifted the direction of the axis so that, three or four
thousand years ago, the polar star was among the stars of the Great Bear? 7 No. If the earth
moved all the time as it moves now, four thousand years ago the star nearest the North Pole must

robin-bobin

have been a-Draconis.8 The change was sudden; the Great Bear "came bowing down."9 In the
Hindu sources it is said that the earth receded from its wonted place by 100 yojanas,10 a yojana
being five to nine miles. Thus the displacement was estimated at from 500 to 900 miles.
The origin of the polar star is told in many traditions all over the world. The Hindus of the Vedas
worshiped the polar star, Dhrura, "the fixed" or "immovable." In the Puranas it is narrated how
Dhrura became the polar star. The Lapps venerate the polar star and believe that if it should
leave its place, the earth would be destroyed in a great conflagration.11 The same belief is found
among the North American Indians.12

The day on which the shortest shadow is cast at noon is the day of the summer solstice; the
longest shadow at noon is cast on the day of the winter solstice. This method of determining the
seasons by measuring the length of the shadows was applied in ancient China, as well as in other
countries.
We possess the Chinese records of the longest and shortest shadows at noontime. These records
are attributed to —1100. "But the shortest and the longest shadows recorded do not really
represent the true lengths at present." 13 The old Chinese charts record the longest day with a
duration which "does not represent the various geographical latitudes of their observatories," and
therefore the figures are supposed to have been those of Babylonia, borrowed by ancient
Chinese, a rather unusual conjecture.14
The length of the longest day in a year depends on the latitude, or the distance from the pole, and
is different at different places. Gnomons or sundials can be built with great precision.15
The Babylonian astronomical tablets of the eighth century provide exact data, according to
which the longest day at Babylon was equal to 14 hours 24 minutes, whereas the modern
determination is 14 hours 10 minutes and 54 seconds.
"The difference between the two figures is too great to be attributable to refraction, which makes
the sun still visible over the horizon after it has set. Thus, the greater length of the day
corresponds to latitude 34° 57', and points to a place 2/2° further to the north; we stand therefore
before a strange riddle [vor einem merkwiirdigen Ratsel]. One tries to decide: either the tablets
of System II do not originate from Babylon [though referring to Babylon], or this city actually
was situated far [farther] to the north, about 35° away from the equator."ie

Since the computations of the astronomical tablets did refer to Babylon, there is a possible
solution that Babylon was situated at a latitude of 35° from the equator, much farther to the north
than the ruins of this city.
Claudius Ptolemy, who, in his Almagest, made computation for contemporaneous and ancient
Babylon, arrived at two different estimates of the longest day at that city, and consequently of
the latitude at which it was located,17 one of his estimates being practically of the present-day
value, the other coinciding with the figure of the ancient Babylonian tables, 14 hours 24 minutes.
The Arabian medieval scholar Arzachel computed from ancient codices that in more ancient
times Babylon was situated at a latitude of 35° 0' from the equator, while in later times it was
situated more to the south. Johannes Kepler drew attention to this calculation of Arzachel and to
the fact that between ancient and modern Babylon there was a difference in latitude.18
Thus Ptolemy, and likewise Arzachel, computed that in historical times Babylon was situated at
latitude 35°. Modern scholars arrived at identical results on the basis of ancient Babylonian
computations. "This much, therefore, is certain: our tables [System II, and I also], and the
astronomers mentioned as well, point to a place about 35° north latitude. Is it possible that they
were mistaken by 2° to 2M°? This is scarcely believable." 19
As there was but one Babylon, its location, at some historical time, at 35° north latitude signifies
that at the longitude of Babylon the earth since then has turned toward the south, and the
direction of the polar axis, or its geographical location, or both, have undergone displacement.
Some of the classic authors knew that the earth had changed its position and had turned toward
the south; not all of them, however,

were aware of the real cause of this perturbation. Diogenes Laertius repeated the teaching of
Leucippus: "The earth was bent or inclined towards the south because the northern regions grew
rigid and inflexible by the snowy and cold weather which ensued thereon."20 The same idea is
found in Plutarch, who quoted the teaching of Democritus: "The northern regions were ill
temperate, but the southern were well; whereby the latter becoming fruitful, waxed greater, and,
by an overweight, preponderated and inclined the whole that way." 21 Empedocles, quoted by
Plutarch, taught that the north was bent from its former position, whereupon the northern regions
were elevated and the southern depressed. Anaxagoras taught that the pole received a turn and
that the world became inclined toward the south.
As we have seen, Seneca in Thyestes correctly ascribed the displacement of the pole to a cosmic
catastrophe.
Temples and Obelisks
In classic authors references can be found to the fact that the temples of the ancient world were
built facing the rising sun.1 Orientation toward the sun is, at the same time, orientation toward
the visible planets, as all of them travel through the signs of the zodiac or in the ecliptic. The sun
changes the point of its rising and setting from one day to another, and the ecliptic makes a
corresponding slow swing from one solstice to another. Therefore, for the purposes of accurate
observation of whether the terrestrial pole shifted in a sudden way, it was necessary to build the
temple observatories, not simply facing the east and the west, but with a device that would
permit checking the position of the sun on the days of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, when
the sun rises exactly in the east and sets exactly in the west.

Hicks differs greatly.

The Tractate Erubin of the Jerusalem Talmud 2 records "the surprising fact"3 that the Temple of
Jerusalem was so built that on the two equinoctial days the first ray of the rising sun shone
directly through the eastern gate; the eastern gate was kept closed during the year, but was
opened on these two days for this very purpose. The first ray of the equinoctial sun shone
through the eastern gate and into the very heart of the Temple.4 There was no sun worship in this
arrangement; it was dictated by the events of the past, when the position of the earth, in relation
to the rising and setting points of the sun, was moved in world catastrophes. The fall equinox
was observed as New Year's day. This ceremony with the equinoctial sun was old. The
Babylonian temples, also, had "the gate of the rising sun" and "the gate of the setting sun."5 With
the growing belief that there would be no more changes in the world system, a belief expressed
also by Deutero-Isaiah (66 : 22), the eastern gate of the Jerusalem Temple was closed forever: it
will be opened in Messianic times.
Although unaware of these ancient practices and literary references to the orientation of the
temples, a writer of the end of the nineteenth century came to the conclusion that the temples of
the ancient world faced the sunrise.6 He found considerable evidence in the position of temples,
but he wondered also that there were deliberate changes in the orientation of the foundations of
some older temples. "The many changes in direction of the foundations at Eleusis revealed by
the French excavations were so very striking and suggestive" that the author asked "whether
there was possible astronomical origin for the direction of the temple and the various changes in
direction." 7
Further investigation by other authors revealed the fact that gen2 Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Erubin V, 22c.

erally only the temples of a later time faced the east, and that earlier temples, built before the
seventh century, had their foundations purposely directed—the same orientation can be traced in
a number of archaic foundations—away from the present east.8
Knowing by now that the earth repeatedly shifted the direction of the sunrise and sunset, we
understand the changes in the orientation of the foundations as the result of changes in nature.
Thus, we have in the foundations of the temples, like that of Eleusis, a record of the changing
direction of the terrestrial axis and the position of the pole; the temple was destroyed by
catastrophes and rebuilt each time with a different orientation.
Besides the temples and their gates, the obelisks also served the purpose of fixing the direction of
east and west, or of sunrise and sunset on equinoctial days. As this purpose was not perceived,
the object for which the obelisks were built seemed enigmatic: "The origin and religious
significance of the obelisks are somewhat obscure." 9
Two pillars were erected before the Temple of Solomon,10 but their purpose is not revealed in
the Scriptures.
In America, obelisk-pillars were built, too. Sometimes a ring was set on the vertex of the pillar
for the sun's rays to pass through. "The solstices and equinoxes were carefully observed. Stone
pillars were erected eight on the east and eight on the west side of Cuzco, to observe the
solstices. ... At the heads of the pillars there were discs for the sun's rays to enter. Marks were

robin-bobin

made on the ground, which had been levelled and paved. Lines were drawn to mark the
movement of the sun. . . .
"To ascertain the time of the equinoxes there was a stone column in the open space before the
temple of the sun, in the center of a large circle. . . . The instrument was called inti-huatana,
which means the place where the sun is tied up or encircled. There are

inti-huatanas on the height of Ollantay-tampu, at Pissac, at Hatun-colla, and in other places." a
The Egyptian obelisk could serve as a gnomon, or shadow clock. The length of the shadow and
its direction would indicate the hour of the day. Obelisks placed in pairs served as a calendar. On
the vernal and autumnal equinoxes their shadows would be continuous for the length of the day,
the sun rising exactly in the east and setting exactly in the west.
That the purpose for which the obelisks were erected was to check on the shadow of the sun (and
the position of the earth) can be plainly seen from this passage of Pliny:
"The obelisk [of Sesothis, brought from Egypt] that has been erected in the campus Martins [in
Rome] has been applied to a singular purpose by the late Emperor Augustus: that of marking the
shadow projected by the sun, and so measuring the length of the days and nights." There then
follows this remark: "For nearly the last thirty years, however, the observations derived from this
dial have been found not to agree: whether it is that the sun itself has changed its course in
consequence of some derangement of the heavenly system; or whether that the whole earth has
been in some degree displaced from the center, a thing that, I have heard say, has been remarked
in other places as well; or whether that some earthquake, confined to this city only, has wrenched
the dial from its original position; or whether it is that in consequence of the inundations of the
Tiber, the foundations of the mass have subsided." 12
The passage indicates that Pliny envisaged every possible cause, not excluding the one known to
have occurred in earlier times when, in the language of Plutarch, "the Pole received a turn or
inclination," or in the words of Ovid, "Earth sank a little lower than her wonted place."
The Shadow Clock
The poles changed their locations; all latitudes were displaced; the axis changed its direction; the
number of days in the year increased

from 360 to 365/4, a fact demonstrated in a following section; the length of the day probably also
altered. Of course, a sundial or shadow clock from before —687 can no longer serve the purpose
for which it was devised, but it might well be of use in proving our assumption.
Such a clock, originating from the period between circa —850 and —720, was found in Faijum
in Egypt at latitude 27°. A horizontal slab with hour marks has at one end a shadow-casting
vertical hob.1 This shadow clock cannot show correctly the change of time in Faijum or
elsewhere in Egypt. A scholar who investigated its working came to the conclusion that it must
have been kept with its head to the east in the forenoon and to the west in the afternoon, and
several scholars agreed that this was the way to use the clock. But this arrangement by itself did
not make it possible to read the time. "Since all actual hour shadows lie substantially closer to
the hob than the corresponding marks of the instrument, the shadow-casting edge must have been
higher over the shadow-receiving plane than we find it to be. The upper edge cannot be the
shadow-caster of the instrument; it must have been on a parallel line above this edge." 2 "The
marks were also not made on the basis of actual observations, but must have been taken from
some theory or other." 3 But, as a critic remarked, "this theory implies that at no season of the

robin-bobin

year did the clock denote the hours correctly, without an hourly alteration of the height of that
part of the instrument which cast the shadow." *
As the clock has no device to adjust the height of the head, it is improbable that this hourly
manipulation took place. Besides, in order to change the height of the head every hour, in itself
an impractical method, it would have been necessary to have another clock to show the hours
without any manipulation, thus indicating the exact

moment when the first clock had to be adjusted. But if there was a clock that could show the
hours correctly without adjustment, what purpose did the shadow clock serve?
Another explanation has therefore been offered for the manner in which the Egyptian sundial
was used. The author of the new idea supposes that at some early date (the precession of the
equinoxes being taken into consideration) the shadow clock was used at some latitude in Egypt
on the day of the summer solstice. He admits: "Account has, however, not been taken of change
in the declination of the sun between sunrise and sunset. . . . For other seasons of the year it
would be necessary at each hour or each clock reading, either to alter the height of the hob, or tilt
the st't [clock] or both. Indeed, when the sun had south declination, and even when it had slight
north declination, it would always be necessary to do both. The inference is, therefore, that the
clock was originally used at or near the time of the summer solstice."B The problem of
adjustment for each reading once more crops up in this explanation, again requiring some better
means of knowing the exact time. The conclusion at which the author of this explanation
arrives—that originally the clock was built for a single day in the year—is rather odd and defies
the very purpose for which clocks are constructed. And even if a clock were to be read only once
a year, the author of this theory could not make the specimen found in Faijum work, but only a
similar clock that had been found broken in pieces; and this he could do only by having recourse
to the precession of the equinoxes and by referring the clock to a period many hundreds of years
earlier than chronolo-gists assume.
The shadow clock found at Faijum, built under the Libyan Dynasty, between about —850 and —
720 before the present era, may help us to learn the length of the day, the inclination of the pole
to the ecliptic, and the latitudes of Egypt in that historical period. A change in any of these three
factors would have made the clock obsolete as an instrument for time reading, and probably all
three factors did change.

shadow clock used in Egypt in the period before the last catastrophe of —687 and possibly
before the catastrophe of —747.
The Water Clock
Besides the gnomon or sundial, the Egyptians used the water clock, which had the advantage
over the former of showing time during the night as well as during the day.
A complete example was found in the Amon Temple of Karnak (Thebes), 25.5° north of the
equator. This water clock dates from the time of Amenhotep III of the Eighteenth Dynasty, father
of Ikhnaton. The jar has an opening through which water flows out; marks are incised on the
inner surface of the jar to indicate the time. Since the Egyptian day was divided into hours which
changed in length with the length of the day, the jar has different sets of markings for the various
seasons of the year. Four time points are prominently important: the autumnal equinox, the
winter solstice, the vernal equinox, and the summer solstice. The equinoxes have equal days and

robin-bobin

nights in all latitudes. But on the solstices, when either the day or the night is the longest of the
year, the length of the daylight varies with the latitude: the farther from the equator, the greater is
the difference between the day and the night on the day of the solstice. This difference also
depends on the inclination of the equator to the plane of the orbit or ecliptic, which is at present
23/2°. Should this inclination change, or in other words, should the polar axis change its
astronomical position (direction), or should the polar axis change its geographical position with
each pole shifting to another point, the length of the day and night (on any day except the
equinoxes) would change, too.
The water clock of Amenhotep III presented its investigator with a very strange time scale.1
Calculating the length of the day of the winter solstice, he found that the clock was constructed
for a day of 11 hours 18 minutes, whereas the day of the solstice at 25° north latitude is 10 hours
26 minutes, a difference of fifty-two minutes. Similarly, the builder of the clock reckoned the
night of the winter 1 L. Borchardt, Die altagyptische Zeitrechnung (1920), pp. 6-25.
324
WORLDS IN COLLISION
solstice to be 12 hours 42 minutes, whereas it is 13 hours 34 minutes— fifty-two minutes too
short.
On the summer solstice, the longest day, the clock anticipated a day of 12 hours 48 minutes,
whereas it is 13 hours and 41 minutes, and a night of 11 hours 12 minutes, whereas it is 10 hours
19 minutes.
On the vernal and autumnal equinoxes the day is 11 hours and 56 minutes long, and the clock
actually shows 11 hours and 56 minutes; the night is 12 hours 4 minutes long, and the clock
shows exactly 12 hours 4 minutes.
The difference between the present values and the values of the day for which the clock is
adjusted is very consistent: on the winter solstice the day of the clock is fifty-two minutes longer
than the present day of the winter solstice in Karnak, and the night is fifty-two minutes shorter;
on the summer solstice the day is fifty-three minutes shorter on the clock and the night fifty-three
minutes longer.
The figures on the clock show a smaller difference between the length of daylight on the
solstices or between the longest and the shortest days of the year than is observed at Karnak at
the present time. Thus the water clock of Amenhotep III, if it was correctly built and correctly
interpreted, indicates that either Thebes was closer to the equator or that the inclination of the
equator toward the ecliptic was less than the present angle of 23/2°. In either case the climate of
the latitudes of Egypt could not have been the same as it is in our age.
As we find from the present research, the clock of Amenhotep III became obsolete in the middle
of the eighth century; and the clock that might have replaced it at that time would have been
made obsolete in the catastrophes of the end of the eighth and the beginning of the seventh
centuries, when once more the axis changed its direction in the sky and its position on the globe
as well.

The change in the position of the poles carried the polar ice outside the new polar circle, while
other regions were brought into the polar circle. There is nothing imperative in the present
position of the pole or in the direction of the polar axis. No known astronomical or geological
law requires the present direction of the axis and the present position of the pole. I find a similar
thought in the writings of Schiaparelli: "The permanence of the geographical poles in the very
same regions of the Earth cannot yet be considered as in-contestably established by astronomical
or mechanical arguments. Such permanence may be a fact today, but it remains a matter still to
be proven for the preceding ages of the history of the globe." "Our problem, so important from
the astronomical and mathematical standpoint, touches the foundations of geology and

paleontology; its solution is tied to the [problem of the] most grandiose events in the history of
the Earth."x
The present pole was not always the terrestrial pole, nor did the changes occur in a slow process.
The glacial sheet was a polar cover; the ice ages terminated with catastrophic suddenness;
regions of mild climate moved instantly into the polar circle; the ice sheet in America and
Europe started to melt; great quantities of vapor rising from the surface of the oceans caused
increased precipitation and the formation of a new ice cover. Gigantic waves that traveled across
continents, more than the movement of the ice, were responsible for the drift, especially in the
north, and for the boulders that were carried long distances and placed atop unrelated formations.
If we look at the distribution of the ice sheet in the Northern Hemisphere, we see that a circle,
with its center somewhere near the east

shore of Greenland or in the strait between Greenland and Baffin Land near the present north
magnetic pole, and a radius of about 3,600 kilometers, embraces the region of the ice sheet of the
last glacial age. Northeastern Siberia is outside the circle; the valley of the Missouri down to 39°
north latitude is within the circle. The eastern part of Alaska is included, but not its western part.
Northwestern Europe is well within the circle; some distance behind the Ural Mountains, the line
curves toward the north and crosses the present polar circle.
Now we reflect: Was not the North Pole at some time in the past 20° or more distant from the
point it now occupies—and closer to America? In like manner, the old South Pole would have
been roughly the same 20° from the present pole.2
The Brahman charts of the sky show a large difference from what modern astronomers would
expect to find. Calcutta being removed 180° longitude from Baffin Land, the Brahman charts
would rather correspond to a position of the earth in which the axis would pierce the globe at
Baffin Land, close to the present magnetic pole. The change in latitude of other regions to the
west and to the east of India would have been smaller.
It is probable that twenty-seven centuries ago, or perhaps thirty-five, the present North Pole was
at Baffin Land or close to the Boothia Felix Peninsula of the American mainland.
The sudden extermination of mammoths was caused by a catastrophe and probably resulted from
asphyxiation or electrocution. The immediately subsequent movement of the Siberian continent

accompanied by a spontaneous lack of oxygen caused by fires raging high in the atmosphere. A

later their dying or dead bodies were moving into the polar circle. In a few hours northeastern
America moved from the frigid zone of the polar circle into a moderate zone; northeastern
Siberia moved in the opposite direction from the moderate zone to the polar circle. The present
cold climate of northern Siberia started when the glacial age in Europe and America came to a
sudden end.
It is assumed here that in historical times neither northeastern Siberia nor western Alaska were in
the polar regions, but that as a result of the catastrophes of the eighth and seventh centuries this
area moved into that region. This assumption implies that these lands, to the extent that they
were not covered by the sea, were most probably places of human habitation. Archaeological
work should be undertaken in northeastern Siberia with the purpose of establishing whether these
now uninhabited tundras were sites of culture twenty-seven centuries ago.

In 1939 and 1940 "one of the most startling and important finds of the century" (E. Stefansson)
was made at Point Hope in Alaska, on the shores of Bering Strait: an ancient city of about eight
hundred houses, whose population had been larger than that of the modern city of Fairbanks, was
discovered there, north of 68°, about 130 miles within the Arctic Circle.4
"Ipiutak, as the location of this ancient city is called by the present Eskimos, must have been

people, in this sense more advanced than any known Eskimos, and clearly derived from eastern
Asia." s
In Central Alaska, where the ground has been frozen for many centuries, animals with flesh still
attached to their bones have been excavated. "Bones of extinct as well as living species of
mammals have been found in most of the regions. . . . They remain not as fossilized bones but in
a frozen state, and in some cases, ligaments, skin, and flesh adhere to the bones."6 During the
season of 1938, "almost the entire skin of a super-bison, the hair remaining," was found in the
Fairbanks area.
"Some of the artifacts found after the stripping at depths of 18 to 20 meters below the original
surface may have been on or near the surface originally, but the position of others tends to
associate them with extinct animal bones at great depths. The recognizable artifacts are
implements of chipped stone, bone and ivory."7
In 1936-1937, in a small area designated as Ester, several implements were found, as well as
numerous burned stones, in association with mammoth, mastodon, bison, and horse bones, at the
bottom of the muck deposits in Ester Creek, some twenty meters below the original surface.8 In
1938 similar finds were made at Engineer Creek at the bottom of the muck, forty meters below
the original surface of the soil.9
These vestiges of life and culture far beneath the surface of the ground are, for the most part,
remnants buried in catastrophes prior to that described in the present chapter; among them are
also remains of culture and life engulfed in the cataclysms of the eighth and seventh centuries.
When the earth's rotation was disturbed, waves of translation moved eastward, because of inertia,

Towns similar to those unearthed in Alaska, and possibly larger ones, will most likely be found

A problem the archaeologists will have to solve is that of clarifying whether the extermination of
life in these regions of northwest America and northeast Asia, resulting in the death of
mammoths, took place in the eighth and seventh or fifteenth century before the present era (or
earlier)—in other words, whether the herds of mammoths were annihilated in the days of Isaiah
or in the days of the Exodus.
CHAPTER 8
The Year of 360 Days
PRIOR to the last series of cataclysms, when, as we assume, the globe spun on an axis pointed in
a different direction in space, with its poles at a different location, on a different orbit, the year
could not have been the same as it has been since.
Numerous evidences are preserved which prove that prior to the year of 365J» days, the year was
only 360 days long. Nor was that year of 360 days primordial; it was a transitional form between
a year of still fewer days and the present year.
In the period of time between the last of the series of catastrophes of the fifteenth century and the
first in the series of catastrophes of the eighth century, the duration of a seasonal revolution
appears to have been 360 days.1
In order to substantiate my statement, I invite the reader on a world-wide journey. We start in
India.
The texts of the Veda period know a year of only 360 days. "All Veda texts speak uniformly and
exclusively of a year of 360 days. Passages in which this length of the year is directly stated are
found in all the Brahmanas." 2 "It is striking that the Vedas nowhere mention an intercalary
period, and while repeatedly stating that the year
1 W. Whiston, in New Theory of the Earth (1696), expressed his belief that before the Deluge
the year was composed of 360 days. He found references in classic authors to a year of 360 days,
and as he recognized only one major catastrophe, the Deluge, he related these references to the
antediluvian era.

und Alterthumskunde (1899), III, 7.

331
consists of 360 days, nowhere refer to the five or six days that actually are a part of the solar
year." 3
This Hindu year of 360 days is divided into twelve months of thirty days each.4 The texts
describe the moon as crescent for fifteen days and waning for another fifteen days; they also say
that the sun moved for six months or 180 days to the north and for the same number of days to
the south.
The perplexity of scholars at such data in the Brahmanic literature is expressed in the following
sentence: "That these are not conventional inexact data, but definitely wrong notions, is shown
by the passage in Nidana-Sutra, which says that the sun remains 13/3 days in each of the 27
Naksatras, and thus the actual solar year is calculated as 360 days long." "Fifteen days are
assigned to each half-moon period; that this is too much is nowhere admitted." 5
In their astronomical works, the Brahmans used very ingenious geometric methods, and their
failure to discern that the year of 360 days was 5M days too short seemed baffling. In ten years
such a mistake accumulates to fifty-two days. The author whom I quoted last was forced to
conclude that the Brahmans had a "wholly confused notion of the true length of the year." Only
in a later period, he said, were the Hindus able to deal with such obvious facts. To the same
effect wrote another German author: "The fact that a long period of time was necessary to arrive
at the formulation of the 365-day year is proved by the existence of the old Hindu 360-day
Savana-year and of other forms which appear in the Veda literature." 6
Here is a passage from the Aryabhatiya, an old Indian work on mathematics and astronomy: "A
year consists of twelve months. A month consists of 30 days. A day consists of 60 nadis. A nadi
consists of 60 vinadikas." 7

The Brahmans were aware that the length of the year, of the month, and of the day changed with
every new world age. The following is a passage from Surya-siddhanta, a classic of Hindu
astronomy. After an introduction, it proceeds: "Only by reason of the revolution of the ages,
there is here a difference of times." 8 The translator of this ancient manual supplied an
annotation to these words: "According to the commentary, the meaning of these last verses is
that in successive Great Ages . . . there were slight differences in the motion of the heavenly
bodies." Explaining the term bija, which means a correction of time in every new age, the book
of Surya says that "time is the destroyer of the worlds."
The sacerdotal year, like the secular year of the calendar, consisted of 360 days composing
twelve lunar months of thirty days each. From approximately the seventh pre-Christian century
on, the year of the Hindus became 565% days long, but for temple purposes the old year of 360
days was also observed, and this year is called savana.
When the Hindu calendar acquired a year of 365M days and a lunar month of twenty-nine and a
half days, the older system was not discarded. "The natural month, containing about twenty-nine
and a half days mean solar time, is then divided into thirty lunar days (tithi), and this division,
although of so unnatural and arbitrary a character, the lunar days beginning and ending at any
moment of the natural day and night, is, to the Hindu, of the most prominent practical
importance, since by it are regulated the performances of many religious ceremonies, and upon it
depend the chief considerations of propitious and unpropitious times, and the like."9
The double system was the imposition of a new time measure upon the old.
The ancient Persian year was composed of 360 days or twelve months of thirty days each. In the
seventh century five Gatha days were added to the calendar.10

In the Bundahis, a sacred book of the Persians, the 180 successive appearances of the sun from
the winter solstice to the summer solstice and from the summer solstice to the next winter
solstice are described in these words: "There are a hundred and eighty apertures [rogin] in the
east, and a hundred and eighty in the west . . . and the sun, every day, comes in through an
aperture, and goes out through an aperture. ... It comes back to Varak, in three hundred and sixty
days and five Gatha days." ll
Gatha days are "five supplementary days added to the last of the twelve months of thirty days
each, to complete the year; for these days no additional apertures are provided. . . . This
arrangement seems to indicate that the idea of the apertures is older than the rectification of the
calendar which added the five Gatha days to an original year of 360 days."12
The old Babylonian year was composed of 360 days.13 The astronomical tablets from the period
antedating the Neo-Babylonian Empire compute the year at so many days, without mention of
additional days. That the ancient Babylonian year had only 360 days was known before the
cuneiform script was deciphered: Ctesias wrote that the walls of Babylon were 360 furlongs in
compass, "as many as there had been days in the year." u
The zodiac of the Babylonians was divided into thirty-six decans, a decan being the space the
sun covered in relation to fixed stars during a ten-day period. "However, the 36 decans with their

robin-bobin

decades require a year of only 360 days."15 To explain this apparently arbitrary length of the
zodiacal path, the following conjecture was made: "At first the astronomers of Babylon
recognized a year of 360 days,
the end of the year." "The Book of Denkart," in H. S. Nyberg, Texte zum mazdayasnischen

and the division of a circle into 360 degrees must have indicated the path traversed by the sun
each day in its assumed circling of the earth." 16 This left over five degrees of the zodiac
unaccounted for. The old Babylonian year consisted of twelve months of thirty days each, the
months being computed from the time of the appearance of the new moon. As the period
between one new moon and another is about twenty-nine and a half days, students of the
Babylonian calendar face the perplexity with which we are already familiar in other countries.
"Months of thirty days began with the light of the new moon. How agreement with astronomical
reality was effected, we do not know. The practice of an intercalary period is not yet known." 17
It appears that in the seventh century five days were added to the Babylonian calendar; they were
regarded as unpropi-tious, and people had a superstitious awe of them.
The Assyrian year consisted of 360 days; a decade was called a sarus; a sarus consisted of 3,600
days.18
"The Assyrians, like the Babylonians, had a year composed of lunar months, and it seems that
the object of astrological reports which relate to the appearance of the moon and sun was to help
to determine and foretell the length of the lunar month. If this be so, the year in common use
throughout Assyria must have been lunar. The calendar assigns to each month thirty full days;
the lunar month is, however, little more than twenty-nine and a half days."19 "It would hardly be
possible for the calendar month and the lunar month to correspond so exactly at the end of the
year." 20
Assyrian documents refer to months of thirty days only, and count such months from crescent to
crescent.21 Again, as in other countries,

it is explicitly the lunar month that is computed by the Assyrian astronomers as equal to thirty
days. How could the Assyrian astronomers have adjusted the length of the lunar months to the
revolutions of the moon, modern scholars ask themselves, and how could the observations
reported to the royal palace by the astronomers have been so consistently erroneous?
The month of the Israelites, from the fifteenth to the eighth century before the present era, was
equal to thirty days, and twelve months comprised a year; there is no mention of months shorter
than thirty days, nor of a year longer than twelve months. That the month was composed of thirty
days is evidenced by Deuteronomy 34 : 8 and

robin-bobin

21 : 13, and Numbers 20 : 29, where mourning for the dead is ordered for "a full month," and is
carried on for thirty days. The story of the Flood, as given in Genesis, reckons in months of thirty
days; it says that one hundred and fifty days passed between the seventeenth day of the second
month and the seventeenth day of the seventh month.22 The composition of this text apparently
dates from the time between the Exodus and the upheaval of the days of Uzziah.23
The Hebrews observed lunar months. This is attested to by the fact that the new-moon festivals
were of great importance in the days of Judges and Kings.24 "The new moon festival anciently
stood at least on a level with that of the Sabbath." 25 As these (lunar) months were thirty days
long, with no months of twenty-nine days in between, and as the year was composed of twelve
such months, with no additional days or intercalated months, the Bible exegetes could find no
way of reconciling the three figures: 354 days, or twelve lunar months of twenty-nine and a half
days each; 360 days, or a multiplex of twelve times thirty; and 365K days, the present length of
the year.

The calendar of the Ebers Papyrus, a document of the New Kingdom, has a year of twelve

In the ninth year of King Ptolemy Euergetes, or —238, a reform party among the Egyptian
priests met at Canopus and drew up a decree; in 1866 it was discovered at Tanis in the Delta,
inscribed on a tablet. The purpose of the decree was to harmonize the calendar with the seasons
"according to the present arrangement of the world," as the text states. One day was ordered to
be added every four years to the "three hundred and sixty days, and to the five days which were
afterwards ordered to be added." 2T
The authors of the decree did not specify the particular date on which the five days were added
to the 360 days, but they do say clearly that such a reform was instituted on some date after the
period when the year was only 360 days long.
On a previous page I referred to the fact that the calendar of 360 days was introduced in Egypt
only after the close of the Middle Kingdom, in the days of the Hyksos. The five epigomena must
have been added to the 360 days subsequent to the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty. We have no
mention of "five days" in all the numerous inscriptions of the Eighteenth Dynasty; the
epigomena or, as the Egyptians called them, "the five days which are above the year," 28 are
known from the documents of the seventh and following centuries. The pharaohs of the late
dynasties used to write: "The year and the five days." The last day of the year was celebrated, not
on the last of the epigomena, but on the thirtieth of Mesori, the twelfth month.29
In the fifth century Herodotus wrote: "The Egyptians, reckoning thirty days to each of the twelve

The Book of Sothis, erroneously ascribed to the Egyptian priest Manetho,31 and Georgius
Syncellus, the Byzantine chronologist,32 maintain that originally the additional five days did not
follow the 360 days of the calendar, but were introduced at a later date,33 which is corroborated
by the text of the Canopus Decree.
That the introduction of epigomena was not the result of progress in astronomical knowledge,
but was caused by an actual change in the planetary movements, is implied in the Canopus
Decree, for it refers to "the amendment of the faults of the heaven." In his Isis and Osiris 34
Plutarch describes by means of an allegory the change in the length of the year: "Hermes playing
at draughts with the moon, won from her the seventieth part of each of her periods of
illumination, and from all the winnings he composed five days, and intercalated them as an
addition to the 360 days." Plutarch informs us also that one of these epigomena days was
regarded as inauspicious; no business was transacted on that day, and even kings "would not
attend to their bodies until nightfall."
The new-moon festivals were very important in the days of the Eighteenth Dynasty. On all the
numerous inscriptions of that period, wherever the months are mentioned, they are reckoned as
thirty days long. The fact that the new-moon festivals were observed at thirty-day intervals
implies that the lunar month was of that duration.
Recapitulating, we find concordant data. The Canopus Decree states that at some period in the
past the Egyptian year was only 360 days long, and that the five days were added at some later
date; the Ebers Papyrus shows that under the Eighteenth Dynasty the calendar had a year of 360
days divided into twelve months of thirty days each; other documents of this period also testify
that the lunar month

had thirty days, and that a new moon was observed twelve times in a period of 360 days. The
Sothis book says that this 360-day year was established under the Hyksos, who ruled after the
end of the Middle Kingdom, preceding the Eighteenth Dynasty.
In the eighth or seventh century the five epigomena days were added to the year under conditions
which caused them to be regarded as unpropitious.
Although the change in the number of days in the year was calculated soon after it occurred,
nevertheless, for some time many nations retained a civil year of 360 days divided into twelve
months of thirty days each.
Cleobulus, who was counted among the seven sages of ancient Greece, in his famous allegory
represents the year as divided into twelve months of thirty days: the father is one, the sons are
twelve, and each of them has thirty daughters.35
From the days of Thales, another of the seven sages, who could predict an eclipse, the Hellenes
knew that the year consists of 365 days; Thales was regarded by them as the man who
discovered the number of days in the year. As he was born in the seventh century, it is not
impossible that he was one of the first among the Greeks to learn the new length of the year; it
was in the beginning of that century that the year achieved its present length. A contemporary of
Thales and also one of the seven sages, Solon was regarded as the first among the Greeks to find
that a lunar month is less than thirty days.36 Despite their knowledge of the correct measure of
the year and the month, the Greeks, after Solon and Thales, continued to keep to the obsolete
calendar, a fact for which we have the testimony of Hippocrates ("Seven years contain 360
weeks"), Xenophon, Aristotle, and Pliny.37 The persistence of reckoning by 360 days is
accounted for not only by a certain reverence for the earlier astronomical year, but also by its
convenience for every computation.

The ancient Romans also reckoned 360 days to the year. Plutarch wrote in his "Life of Numa"
that in the time of Romulus, in the eighth century, the Romans had a year of 360 days only.88
Various Latin authors say that the ancient month was composed of thirty days.39
On the other side of the ocean, the Mayan year consisted of 360 days; later five days were added,
and the year was then a tun (360-day period) and five days; every fourth year another day was
added to the year. "They did reckon them apart, and called them the days of nothing: during the
which the people did not anything," wrote J. de Acosta, an early writer on America.40
Friar Diego de Landa, in his Yucatan before and after the Conquest, wrote: "They had their
perfect year like ours, of 365 days and six hours, which they divided into months in two ways. In
the first the months were of 30 days and were called U which signifies the moon, and they
counted from the rising of the new moon until it disappeared."41 The other method of reckoning,
by months of twenty days' duration (uinal hunekeh), reflects a much older system, to which I
shall return when I examine more archaic systems than that of the 360-day year. De Landa also
wrote that the five supplementary days were regarded as "sinister and unlucky." They were
called "days without name."42 Although the Mexicans at the time of the conquest called a thirtyday period "a moon," they knew that the synodical moon period is 29.5209 days,43 which is
more exact than the Gregorian calendar introduced in Europe ninety years after the discovery of
America. Obviously, they adhered to an old tradition dating from the time when the year had
twelve months of thirty days each, 360 days in all.44

In ancient South America also the year consisted of 360 days, divided into twelve months.
"The Peruvian year was divided into twelve Quilla, or moons of thirty days. Five days were
added at the end, called Allcacanquis." 45 Thereafter, a day was added every four years to keep
the calendar correct.
We cross the Pacific Ocean and return to Asia. The calendar of the peoples of China had a year
of 360 days divided into twelve months of thirty days each.46
A relic of the system of 360 days is the still persisting division of the sphere into 360 degrees;
each degree represented the diurnal advance of the earth on its orbit, or that portion of the zodiac
which was passed over from one night to the next. After 360 changes the stellar sky returned to
the same position for the observer on the earth.
When the year changed from 360 to 365M days, the Chinese added five and a quarter days to
their year, calling this additional period Khe-ying; they also began to divide a sphere into 365K
degrees, adopting the new year-length not only in the calendar, but also in celestial and terrestrial
geometry.47
Ancient Chinese time reckoning was based on a coefficient of sixty; so also in India, Mexico,
and Chaldea, sixty being the universal coefficient.
The division of the year into 360 days was honored in many ways,48

and, indeed, it became an incentive to progress in astronomy and geometry, so that people did
not readily discard this method of reckoning when it became obsolete. They retained their
"moons" of thirty days, though the lunar month in fact became shorter, and they regarded the five
days as not belonging to the year.
All over the world we find that there was at some time the same calendar of 360 days, and that at
some later date, about the seventh century before the present era, five days were added at the end
of the year, as "days over the year," or "days of nothing."
Scholars who investigated the calendars of the Incas of Peru and the Mayas of Yucatan
wondered at the calendar of 360 days; so did the scholars who studied the calendars of the
Egyptians, Persians, Hindus, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Hebrews, Chinese, Greeks, or Romans. Most
of them, while debating the problem in their own field, did not suspect that the same problem
turned up in the calendar of every nation of antiquity.
Two matters appeared perplexing: a mistake of five and a quarter days in a year could certainly
be traced, not only by astronomers, but even by analphabetic farmers, for in the short span of
forty years— a period that a person could readily observe—the seasons would become displaced
by more than two hundred days. The second perplexity concerns the length of a month. "It seems
to have been a prevailing opinion among the ancients that a lunation or synodical month lasted
thirty days."49 In many documents of various peoples, it is said that the month, or the "moon," is
equal to thirty days, and that the beginning of such a month coincides with the new moon.
Such declarations by ancient astronomers make it clear that there was no such thing as a
conventional calendar with an admitted error;
epigomena." He refers to the 360 gods in the "theology of Orpheus," to the 360 eons of the
gnostic genii, to the 360 idols before the palace of Dairi in Japan, to 360 statues "surrounding
that of Hobal," worshiped by the ancient Arabs, to the 360 genii who take possession of the soul
after death, "according to the doctrine of the Christians of St. John," to the 360 temples built on
the mountain of Lowham in China, and to the wall of 360 stadia "with which Semiramis
surrounded the city" of Babylon. This material did not convey to its collector the idea that an
astronomical year of 360 days had been the reason for the sacredness of the number 360. 49

as a matter of fact, the existence of an international calendar in those days is extremely unlikely.
After centuries of open sea lanes and international exchange of ideas, no uniform calendar for
the whole world has as yet been devised: the Moslems have a lunar year, based on the
movements of the moon, which is systematically adjusted every few years to the solar year by
intercalation; many other creeds and peoples have systems of their own containing many vestiges
of ancient systems. The reckoning of months as equal to thirty and thirty-one days is also a relic
of older systems; the five supplementary days were divided among the old lunar months. But at

robin-bobin

present the almanac does not ascribe an interval of thirty days between two lunations or a period
of 360 days for twelve lunations.
The reason for the universal identity of time reckoning between the fifteenth and the eighth
centuries lay in the actual movement of the earth on its axis and along its orbit, and in the
revolution of the moon, during that historical period. The length of a lunar revolution must have
been almost exactly 30 days, and the length of the year apparently did not vary from 360 days by
more than a few hours.
Then a series of catastrophes occurred that changed the axis and the orbit of the earth and the
orbit of the moon, and the ancient year, after going through a period marked by disarranged
seasons, settled into a "slow-moving year" (Seneca) of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 46
seconds, a lunar month being equal to 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 2.7 seconds, mean
synodical period.
Disarranged Months
As a result of repeated perturbations, the earth changed from an orbit of 360 days' duration to
one of 365/4 days, the days probably not being exactly equal in both cases. The month changed
from thirty to twenty-nine and a half days. These were the values at the beginning and at the end
of the century of "the battle of the gods." As a result of the perturbations of this century, there
were intermediary values of the year and the month. The length of the year probably ranged
between 360 and 365/4 days, but the moon, being a smaller (or
WORLDS IN COLLISION
343
weaker) body than the earth, suffered greater perturbations from the contacting body, and the
intermediate values of the month could have been subjected to greater changes.
Plutarch declares that in the time of Romulus the people were "irrational and irregular in their
fixing of the months," and reckoned some months at thirty-five days and some at more, "trying to
keep to a year of 360 days," and that Numa, Romulus' successor, corrected the irregularities of
the calendar and also changed the order of the months. This statement suggests the question:
Might it not have been that during the period between consecutive catastrophes the moon
receded to an orbit of thirty-five or thirty-six days' duration?
If, in the period of confusion, the moon actually changed for a while to such an orbit, it must
have been an ellipse or a circle of a radius larger than before. In the latter case, each of the four
moon phases must have been of nine days' duration. It is of interest, therefore, to read that in
many sagas dealing with the moon, the number nine is used in measures of time.1
A series of scholars found that nine days was for a while a time period of many ancient peoples:
the Hindus, the Persians,2 the Raby-lonians,3 the Egyptians,4 and the Chinese.5 In religious
traditions, literature, and astrological works, seven days and nine days compete as the measure of
the month's quarter.
In the time of the Homeric epics, the nine-day week became prevalent in the Greek world. The
seven-day week and the nine-day
1 "The number nine occurs conspicuously in so many sagas which, for other reasons, I
recognized to be moon sagas, that I am convinced that the holiness of this number has its origin
in its very ancient application in time division." The author of this passage (E. Siecke, Die
Liebesgeschichte des Himmels, Vnter-suchungen zur indogermanischen Sagenkunde [1892]) did
not suppose a change in the nature of the lunar cycles, and also was not aware of the work of the
scholar referred to in the following footnote, yet he was forced to believe that nine was
connected with a time subdivision of a month.

week are both found in Homer.6 The Romans, too, retained the recollection of a time when the
week had been of nine days' duration.7
The change from a seven-day phase to a nine-day phase is found in the traditions of the peoples
of Rumania, Lithuania, and Sardinia, and among the Celts of Europe, the Mongols of Asia, and
the tribes of West Africa.8
In order to explain this strange phenomenon in time reckoning, obviously connected with the
moon, the suggestion was made that, in addition to the seventh-day phase of the moon, a nineday phase was also observed, which is a third part of the month.9 But this idea must be rejected,
because a third part of a month of twenty-nine and a half days would more nearly be ten days
and not nine.10 Besides, the quarter-month phases are easily observable periods during which
the moon increases from new moon to half moon, to full moon, and then decreases accordingly;
but a nine-day period falls between these phases.
Therefore, and in view of the vast material from many peoples, we conclude that at one time
during the century of perturbations, for a period between two catastrophes, the moon receded to
an orbit of thirty-five to thirty-six days' duration. It remained on such an orbit for a few decades
until, at the next upheaval, it was carried to an orbit of twenty-nine and a half days' duration, on
which it has proceeded since then.
These "perturbed months" occurred in the second half of the eighth century, at the beginning of
Roman history.11 What is more, we have

10 The sidereal month, or the period of time during which the moon completes a revolution in
relation to the fixed stars is 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes. But the phases of the moon change
according to the synodical month of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes; after a synodical month the
moon returns to the same position in relation to die sun as viewed from the earth.

actual dates like "the 33rd day of the month," cited in the Babylonian tablets of that period.12
Thus the month which was equal to thirty days changed to thirty-six and then to twenty-nine and
a half days. The last change was simultaneous with the change of the terrestrial orbit to one of
365% days' duration.
Years of Ten Months
When the month was about thirty-six days and the year between 360 and 365/4 days, the year
must have been composed of only ten months. This was the case.
According to many classical authors, in the days of Romulus the year consisted of ten months,
and in the time of Numa, his successor, two months were added: January and February. Ovid
writes: "When the founder of the city [Rome] was setting the calendar in order, he ordained that
there should be twice five months in his year. . . . He gave his laws to regulate the year. The
month of Mars was the first, and that of Venus the second. . . . But Numa overlooked not Janus
and the ancestral shades [February] and so to the ancient months he prefixed two." 1
Geminus, a Greek astronomer of the first century before the present era, says similarly that it was
Romulus who (in the eighth century) established the year of ten months.2 Aulus Gellius, a
second century author, writes in his Attic Nights: "The year was composed not of twelve months,
but of ten."3 Plutarch remarks that in his day there was a belief that the Romans, in the time of
Romulus, computed the year "not in twelve months, but in ten, by adding more than thirty days

robin-bobin

to some of the months."4 At the beginning of Numa's reign the ten-month year was still the
official one.5 "March was considered the first month until the reign of Numa, the full year before

that time containing ten months," wrote Procopius of Caesarea, who lived in the closing years of
the Roman Empire.6 The fact that, in Romulus' time, the first month was named in honor of
Mars and the second in honor of Venus shows the importance of these two deities in that period
of history. July was named Quintilis (the fifth). The difference of two months still survives in the
names September, October, November, and December, which denote the seventh, eighth, ninth,
and tenth months, but according to present-day reckoning they are the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and
twelfth months, respectively.
Not only was the year divided into fewer than twelve months, but also the zodiac, or the path of
the sun and the moon across the firmament, at present consisting of twelve signs, at one time had
eleven and at another time ten signs. A zodiac of fewer than twelve signs was employed by the
astrologers of Rabylonia, ancient Greece, and other countries.7 A Jewish song in the Aramaic
language which is included in the Seder Service refers to eleven constellations of the Zodiac.
The calendars of the primitive peoples disclose their early origin by the fact that many of them
are composed of ten months, and some of eleven months. If the time of the lunar revolution was
thirty-five days and some hours, the year was something over ten months long.
The Yurak Samoyeds reckon eleven months to the year.8 The natives of Formosa, too, have a
year of eleven months.9 The year of the Kamchadals is made up of ten months, "one of which is
said to be as long as three." 10 The inhabitants of the Kingsmill Islands in the Pacific, also called
the Gilbert Islands, near the equator, use a ten-month period for their year.11 In the Marquesas

known.12
The Toradja of the Dutch East Indies compute time in moon-months. Each year, however, a
period of two or three months is not brought into the computation at all, and is omitted in time
reckoning.13
The Chams of Indo-China have a calendar of only ten months to the year.14 The natives in some
islands of the Indian Ocean also observe ten months to the year.15
The aborigines of New Zealand do not count two months in the year. "These two months are not
in the calendar: they do not reckon them; nor are they in any way accounted for."ie
"Among the Yoruba of South Nigeria the three months—February, March, April—are generally
given no specific name."1T
These calendars of primitive peoples are similar to the old Roman calendar. They were not
invented in disregard of the solar year ('Tears with less than twelve months are to us the strangest

robin-bobin

of phenomena"18); their fault is that they are more constant than the revolution of the earth on
her orbit around the sun. The work of adapting the old systems to a new order is still evident in
the systems of the aborigines of Kamchatka, South Nigeria, the Dutch East Indies, and New
Zealand. Instead of introducing two additional months, as in the reform of Numa, one of the
months is extended to triple its length, or a period equivalent to two months is not counted at all
in the calendric system.
The abundance of proofs of the existence of a ten-month year is even embarrassing. Since the
period when the year was composed of ten months of thirty-five to thirty-six days each was
short, how could this ten-month year leave so many vestiges in the calendar systems all over the
world? The answer to this question will become simple when we shall find that this was the
second time in the history of the

world that the year was composed of ten months. In a much earlier age, when the year was of an
entirely different length, one revolution of the earth was also equal in time to ten revolutions of
the moon. We shall trace this period in history in a succeeding volume of this work.
The Reforming of the Calendar
In the middle of the eighth century the calendar then in use became obsolete. From the year —
747 until the last of the catastrophes on the twenty-third of March, —687, the solar and lunar
movements changed repeatedly, necessitating adjustments of the calendar. Reforms undertaken
during this time soon became obsolete in their turn, and were replaced by new ones; only after
the last catastrophe of —687, when the present world order was established, did the calendar
become permanent.
Some of the clay tablets of Nineveh found in the royal library of that cityx contain astronomical
observations made during the period before the present order in the planetary system was
established. One tablet fixes the day of the vernal equinox as the sixth of Nisan: "On the sixth of
the month Nisan, the day and night are equal." But another tablet places the equinox on the
fifteenth of Nisan. "We cannot explain the difference," wrote a scholar.2 Judging by the accurate
methods employed and the precision achieved in their observations, the stargazers of Nineveh
would not have erred by nine days.
In the astronomical tablets of Nineveh "three systems of planets" are extensively represented;
single planets are followed in all their movements in three different schedules. For the
movements of the moon there are two different systems.3 Each of these systems is carried out
down to the smallest detail, but only the last system of the planets and of the moon conforms to
the present world order.

is defined as the twentieth degree

of the sign of the zodiac called the Archer; at aphelion, when the earth is farthest from the sun,
the sun is said to be at the twentieth degree of Gemini. Accordingly, these points are designated
as stations of the fastest and slowest solar motion. "But the real position of the apsides decidedly

robin-bobin

contradicts these statements." 4 Another tablet, No. 272, seventy years younger than the first,
gives very different data for the perihelion and aphelion, and scholars wonder at this.
All the numerous data on solar movements in one of the systems lead to one and the same
conclusion. "The solstitial and equinoctial points of the ecliptic lay 6° too far to the east." 5
"The distances traveled by the moon on the Chaldean ecliptic from one new moon to the next
are, according to Tablet No. 272, on the average 3° 14' too great." 6 This means that during a
lunar month the moon moved a greater distance in relation to the fixed stars than present
observation shows.
In Tablet No. 32, the movement of the sun along the zodiac is precisely calculated in degrees,
and the station of the sun at the beginning of each lunar month is determined exactly; but it is "a
perplexing presentation of the ununiform movement of the sun. The question is insistent: Why is
it that the Babylonians formulated the nonuniformity of the solar movement precisely in this
way?" 7
As the various systems recorded in the astronomical tablets of Nineveh show, the world order
changed repeatedly in the course of a single century. Hence, the Chaldean astronomers had the
task of repeatedly readjusting the calendar. "From certain passages in the astrological tablets it is
easy to see that the calculation of times and seasons was one of the chief duties of the astrologers
in Mesopotamia." 8 The scholars ask: How could those men, employed for that very purpose,
have made the egregious mistakes recorded in the tablets, and carried these mistakes over into
systems in which the movements of the sun, the moon, and the five planets were recorded with
repetitions at regular intervals, these movements and intervals being consistently different from
those of the present celestial order?

How could the stargazers who composed the earlier tablets be so careless as to maintain that the
year is 360 days long, a mistake that in six years accumulates to a full month of divergence; or
how could the astronomers of the royal observatories announce to the king the movements of the
moon and its phases on wrong dates, though a child can tell when the moon is new,9 and then
record all this in very scholarly tablets requiring advanced mathematical knowledge?10 Hence
scholars speak of "enigmatic mistakes." n
However, it appears to us that the tablets with their changing astronomical systems reflect the
changing order of the world and consequent attempts to adjust the calendar to the changes.
When the cataclysm of the 23rd of March, —687 brought about another disturbance in the length
of the year and the month, the new standards remained uncertain until they could be calculated
anew in a series of investigations.
From the time of that catastrophe until about the year —669 or —667, no New Year festivals
were observed at Babylon.12 "Eight years under Sennacherib, twelve years under Esarhaddon:
for twenty years . . . the New Year's festival was omitted," says an ancient chronicle on a clay
tablet.13 According to cuneiform inscriptions, in the days of Sargon II a new world age began,
and in the days of his son Sennacherib another world age.14 In the days of Assurbanipal, son of
Esarhaddon, son of Sennacherib, the planetary movements, the precession of the equinoxes, and
the periodic returns of the eclipses were recalculated, and these new tablets, together with the
older ones or copies of the older ones, were stored in the palace library at Nineveh.

concerning them formed a very important section of the Babylonian and Assyrian priesthood."

The tablets from Nineveh provide the best possible opportunity to learn how the order of the
world changed in the eighth and seventh centuries.
Repeated changes in the course of the sun across the firmament led the astronomers of Babylonia
to distinguish three paths of the sun: the Anu path, the Enlil path, and the Ea path. These three
paths created much difficulty for the writers on Babylonian astronomy, and many explanations
were offered and as many rejected.15 The Anu, Enlil, and Ea paths of the planets across the sky
appear to denote the successive ecliptics in various world ages. Like the sun, the planets in
different times moved along the Anu, Enlil, and Ea paths.
In the Talmudie a number of scattered passages deal with a calendric change made by Hezekiah.
The Talmud was written about a thousand years after Hezekiah, and not all details of the reform
are preserved; it states that Hezekiah doubled the month of Nisan.
In later times, in order to adjust the lunar year to the solar year, an intercalary month was added
every few years by doubling the last month of the year, Adar. This system of an intercalary Adar
is preserved in the Hebrew calendar to this day.
The rabbis wondered why Hezekiah added another Nisan (the first month). The story is told in
the Scriptures that Hezekiah, instead of celebrating Passover in the first month, put off the feast
to the second month.17 The Talmud explains that it was not the second month, but an additional
Nisan.
It must be noted that in Judea in the days of Hezekiah the months were not called by Babylonian
names, and therefore the situation should be stated as follows: Hezekiah, after the death of Ahaz,
and before the second invasion of Sennacherib, added a month and postponed the feast of
Passover. According to the Talmud this was done to make the lunar year correspond more
closely to the solar year. As

we shall see, there appears to be some similarity between this action
and that by Numa at about the same time.
What permanent changes Hezekiah introduced in the calendar is not stated, but it is apparent that
at that time calendar reckoning became a complicated matter. As Moses in his day "could not
understand how to compute the calendar until God showed him the movements of the moon
plainly," so in the days of Hezekiah the determination of the month and of the year became a
matter, not of calculation, but of direct observation, and could not be performed much in
advance. Isaiah called the astrologers "the monthly prognosticators."1S \ As we have already
said, there is in the Talmud19 the information that the Temple of Solomon was built so that on
the equinoctial days of the year the direction of the rays of the rising sun could be tested. A gold
plate or disc was affixed to the eastern gate; through it the rays of the rising sun fell into the heart
of the Temple. The Festival of the Tabernacle (Sukkoth) "was originally an equinoctial festival
as Exodus 23 : 16 and 34 : 22 state explicitly, celebrated during the last seven days of the year,
and immediately preceding the New Year's Day, the day of the fall equinox, upon the tenth of the
seventh month." 20 In other words, New Year's Day, or the day of the autumnal equinox, was
observed on the tenth day of the seventh month, the day when the sun rose exactly in the east and

robin-bobin

set exactly in the west, the Day of Atonement falling on the same day.21 Thereafter, the day of
the New Year was moved back to the first day of the seventh month. Wemay note that not only
on the Jewish calendar, but also according to the Babylonian tablets, the equinoctial dates were
displaced by nine days: one tablet says that in the spring day and night are equal on the fifteenth
of the month Nisan; another tablet says that it takes place on the sixth of the same month. This
indicates that the change

21 Morgenstern says: "Upon the tenth of the seventh month ancient Israel celebrated originally,
not die Day of Atonement, but die New Year's day." Ibid., p. 37. in the calendar of the feasts
observed in Jerusalem followed astronomical changes.
The eastern gate of the Temple of Jerusalem was no longer correctly oriented after the cardinal
points had become displaced. On his accession to the throne following the death of Ahaz,
Hezekiah "inaugurated a sweeping religious reformation."22 II Chronicles 29 : 3 ff. says: "He in
the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and
repaired them." Apparently the natural changes in terrestrial rotation which took place in the
days of Uzziah and again on the day of the burial of Ahaz, necessitated a reform. Hezekiah
therefore gathered the priests "into the east street" and spoke to them, saying that "our fathers
have trespassed" and "have shut up the doors of the porch."
In the pre-Exilic period it was held "to be of imperative necessity that on two days of the year the
sun shone directly through the eastern gate," and "through all the eastern gates of the Temple
arranged in line, directly into the very heart of the Temple proper." 2S The eastern gate, also
called "sun gate," served not only to check on the equinoxes, when the sun rises exactly in the
east, but on the solstices as well: a device on the eastern gate was designed to reflect the first
rays of the sun on the summer and winter solstices, when the sun rises in the southeast and the
northeast, respectively. According to Talmudic authorities, the early prophets experienced much
difficulty in making this arrangement work.24
From biblical times vestiges of three calendar systems remain,25 and this assumes a special
interest in view of the fact we noted some pages back, namely, that the tablets from Nineveh
record three different systems of solar and planetary movements, each of which is complete in
itself and differs from the others at every point.
It appears that the adjustment of the calendar, following the initiation of the new world order in
the days of Hezekiah, was a long &nd tedious process. As late as one hundred years after
Hezekiah,

during the Babylonian exile, in the days of Solon and Thales, Jeremiah, Baruch, and Ezekiel
drew up the calendar from year to year.26
When the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile, they brought with them their present
calendar, in which the months are called by Assyro-Babylonian names.
"For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will [do] make, shall remain before me, saith
the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain," reads the closing chapter of the Book of
Isaiah. All flesh will come to worship the Lord "from one new moon to another, and from one
sabbath to another." The "new heavens" means a sky with constellations or luminaries in new
places. The prophet promises that the new sky will be everlasting and that the months will keep
forever their established order.

Daniel, the Jewish sage at the court of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Exile, when blessing the
Lord, said to the king: "He changeth the times and the seasons." 27 This is a remarkable sentence
which is also preserved in many Jewish prayers. By the change of seasons or "appointed dates"
(moadim) is meant an alteration in the order of nature, with shifting of solstitial and equinoctial
dates and the festivals connected with them. "The change of times" could refer not only to the
last change, but to the previous ones also, and it was "the change of the times and the seasons"
that was followed by calendar reforms.
The old Hindu astronomical observations offer a set of calculations different from those of the
present day. "What is extraordinary are the durations assigned to the synodical revolutions. ... To
meet in Hindu astronomy with a set of numerical quantities widely differing from those
generally accepted is indeed so startling that one at first feels strongly inclined to doubt of the
soundness of the text. . . . Moreover, each figure is given twice over." 28

background of the fixed stars, are about five days too short for Saturn, over five days too short
for Jupiter, eleven days too short for Mars, eight or nine days too short for Venus, less than two
days too short for Mercury. In a solar system in which the earth revolves around the sun in 360
days, the synodical periods of Jupiter and Saturn would be about five days shorter than they are
at present, and that of Mercury less than two days shorter. But Mars and Venus of the synodical
table of Varaha Mihira must have had orbits different from their present ones, even if the
terrestrial year was only 360 days.
Calendric changes in India were effected in the seventh century: at that time, as in China also,
the ten-month year was supplanted by a twelve-month year.29
In the eighth century a calendar reform was made in Egypt. We have already referred to a
cataclysm during the reign of the Pharaoh Osorkon II of the Libyan Dynasty; another disturbance
of a cosmic nature took place a few decades later, still in the time of the Libyan Dynasty.
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Sosenk III "there occurred a remarkable prodigy of uncertain
nature, but in some way connected with the moon." 30 The contemporaneous document written
by the royal son, the high priest Osorkon, reads: "In the year 15, fourth month of the third
season, 25th day, under the majesty of his august father, the divine ruler of Thebes, before
heaven devoured (or: not devoured) the moon, great wrath arose in this land."31 Soon thereafter
Osorkon "introduced a new calendar of offerings." 32 The mutilated condition of the inscription
makes it impossible to determine the exact nature of the calendric reform.33
It appears that the same or a similar disturbance in the movement of the moon is the subject of an
Assyrian inscription, which specks

of the moon being obstructed on its way. "Day and night it was handicapped. In its august station
it did not stand." Because of the duration of the phenomenon, it is concluded that "it could not
mean an eclipse of the moon."34 The reference to the moon's unwonted position also precludes
such an interpretation.
At the end of the eighth or the beginning of the seventh century before the present era, the people
of Rome introduced a calendar reform. In the preceding section we referred to Ovid's statement
in Fasti concerning the reform of Romulus, who divided the year into ten months, and the reform

robin-bobin

of Numa, who "prefixed" two months. Plutarch's "Life of Numa" contains the following passage,
part of which has already been quoted: "He [Numa] applied himself, also, to the adjustment of
the calendar, not with exactness, and yet not altogether without careful observation. For during
the reign of Romulus, they had been irrational and irregular in their fixing of the months,
reckoning some at less than twenty days, some at thirty-five, and some at more; they had no idea
of the inequality in the annual motions of the sun and moon, but held to the principle only, that
the year should consist of three hundred and sixty days." 35
Numa reformed the calendar, and the "correction of the inequality which he made was destined
to require other and greater corrections in the future. He also changed the order of the months."
38
Numa was a contemporary of Hezekiah.37
In the second half of the seventh century before the present era, the length of the new month and
the new year was calculated by the Greeks.
Diogenes Laertius regarded Thales the Milesian, one of the "seven sages of antiquity," as the
man who discovered the number of days in the year and the length of the seasons. In his Life of
Thales he wrote: "He was the first to determine the sun's course from solstice to

357
solstice." And again: "He is said to have discovered the seasons of the year and to have divided it
into 365 days." 38 He was "the first to predict eclipses of the sun and to fix the solstices." 30
Thales is said to have written two treatises, one "On the Solstice" and the other "On the
Equinox," neither of which is extant.
If the natural year always was what it is now, it is very strange that this discovery should have
been attributed to a sage who lived as late as the seventh century, when Egypt and Assyria were
already very old kingdoms, and when the dynasty of David was in its last decades. The longest
and shortest days of the year, and thus the length of the year, are easily determined by the length
of the shadow. Thales is said to have been born in the first year of the thirty-fifth Olympiad or —
640. The progress of culture would hardly leave to one and the same person the calculation of
the days in a year, which is a simple matter, and the calculation of forthcoming eclipses, which is
an advanced achievement. Similarly, the fact, as stated by Plutarch and Diogenes Laertius, that
Solon, another sage of the same period, adjusted the months to the motion of the moon after
finding that the time from one new moon to another is half a day shorter than thirty days, must
be understood as an adjustment of the calendar to the new order in nature. The span of time from
one new moon to another is a natural time division, almost as easily observable as day and night;
primitive peoples, unable to read and write, know that the period is less than thirty days.
On the other side of the globe, the people of Peru reckoned time from the day of the last
cataclysm, and this method of computation was in use when the Europeans reached that country
in the beginning of the sixteenth century.40
After the last cataclysm, the times and the seasons were computed anew. King Inti-CapacYupanqui ordered astronomical observations and calculations to be made, the result of which
was a calendar re38 Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers (English transl. R. D. Hicks, 1925).

form, and the year, previously of 360 days, "was changed to 365 days and 6 hours." "
"This Ynca appears to have been the first to order and settle ceremonies. ... He it was who
established the twelve months of the year, giving a name to each, and ordaining the ceremonies
that were to be observed in each. For although his ancestors used months and years counted by
the quipus, yet they were never previously regulated in such order until the time of this lord." 42

"All Toltec histories mention an assembly of sages and astrologers that was convoked in the city
of Huehue-Tlapallan for the purpose of working on the correction of the calendar, and the
reforming of the computation of the year, which was recognized as erroneous and which had
been employed until that time." *3
Half a meridian away, across the Pacific Ocean, a calendar was introduced in Japan in —660,
and the reckoning of years in that country starts from that year.
In China, the astronomer Y-hang in the year —721 announced to the Emperor Hiuen-tsong that
the order of the sky and the movements of the planets had changed which made it impossible to
predict eclipses; and he referred to other authorities who asserted that in the time of Tsin the
planet Venus used to move 40 degrees to the south of the ecliptic and eclipse the star Sirius. Yhang explained that the course of the planet Venus changed in the days of Tsin. **
All around the globe the years following —687 saw activity directed toward reforming the
calendar. Between —747 and —687 the calendar was in a chaotic state, the length of the year
and of the month, and probably also of the day, repeatedly changing. Before the eighth century
there was a comparatively long span of time when the year

had 360 days and the lunar month consisted of almost exactly thirty days.
Neither the calendar, nor the celestial charts, nor the sundials, nor the water clocks of the time
before —687 were adequate for their purpose after that year. Values subsequently established in
different parts of the terrestrial globe have remained practically unchanged down to the present
save for very small improvements resulting from the more precise calculations of modern times.
This stability of the calendar is due to the fact that the celestial order has remained unaltered: no
changes in the heavenly order were observed except for minor perturbations between the planets
which have no visible effect on their motion. Thus we are lulled into the belief—which is
wishful thinking—that we live in an orderly universe. In the language of a modern scientist:
"Though the order of the succession of events in the heavens is often somewhat complex, it is
nevertheless systematic and invariable. The running of no clock ever approached in precision the
motions of the sun, the moon, and the stars. In fact, to this day clocks are corrected and regulated
by comparing them with the apparent diurnal motions of the heavenly bodies. Since not merely a
few but hundreds of celestial phenomena were long ago found to be perfectly orderly, it was
gradually perceived that majestic order prevails universally in those regions in which, before the
birth of science, capricious gods and goddesses were believed to hold domain." 45
However, as we have learned from the records of ancient times, the order today is not the
primeval order; it was established less than twenty-seven centuries ago
when the moon was placed in orbit, when the silver sun was planted, when the Bear was firmly
stationed.46

CHAPTER 9
The Moon and Its Craters
THE MOON revolves around the earth and, together with the earth, around the sun, showing one
and the same face to the inhabitants of the earth. It can be seen in the telescope that the surface of
the moon is covered with seas of dried lava and with great craterlike formations. Since it has no
atmosphere, the contours of its surface are clearly visible, and a city or village, if it existed there,
could be seen through the Palomar telescope. But it is a dead planet and very inhospitable. For a
half-month any place on it is in cold night and for the other half-month in hot sunshine. There is

robin-bobin

no water on the planet, no vegetation, and probably no life at all. The ancients were interested to
know whether the moon had human settlements, but moderns are concerned with the problem of
the origin of the lunar craters.
There are two theories: one sees in them great extinct volcanoes; the other, formations produced
by the bombardment of great meteorites on the semiliquid mass of the moon before it solidified.
There are more than thirty thousand such craters, small and large. Some of these circular crests
rise as high as 20,000 feet above the plain—their height is measured by the length of their
shadows; some, like Clavius near the moon's south pole, are one hundred and fifty miles in
diameter. This tremendous width surpasses anything comparable among volcanoes on earth. It is
therefore questioned whether these circular mountain formations represent true volcanoes. The
largest known crater produced by the impact of a body that fell on the
360
WORLDS IN COLLISION
361
earth is in Arizona; it is four fifths of a mile in diameter and much smaller than the crater
formations on the moon.
As is readily seen, both theories of lunar craters imply a great catastrophic occurrence. For such
craters to have been formed, tremendous forces must have acted from inside or from without; if
these formations were caused by impact on a viscous mass, great meteors must have come flying
from many directions.
Bright streaks or "rays" up to ten miles wide radiate from some of the craters; their origin, too, is
not known. There are also clefts, irregular in form, about half a mile wide and of unknown depth.
In the cosmic catastrophes described in this book the moon was repeatedly involved. Together
with the terrestrial globe it passed through the fabric of the great comet of the time of the
Exodus, and in the conflicts of the eighth century before the present era, the moon was more than
once displaced from its orbit by Mars. During these catastrophes the moon's surface flowed with
lava and bubbled into great circular formations, which rapidly cooled off in the long lunar night,
unprotected by an atmosphere from the coolness of cosmic spaces. In these cosmic collisions or
near contacts the surface of the moon was also marked with clefts and rifts.
The "play" of Mars with the moon was regarded by the Greeks and the Romans as a love affair.1
From the Iliad we learn that Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of the moon) was warned by JupiterZeus not to battle Ares-Mars, but to leave this task to Hera-Earth and Pallas Athene, being
herself predestined to the sweet work of love.
Interplanetary contacts in the celestial sphere are in some respects similar to congress and
germination in the biological world. In these contacts the bodies of the planets overflow with
lava—fertile ground for vegetation—and comets born of such contacts fly across the solar
system and rain gases and stones and possibly also spores, germs, or larvae on planets. Thus the
notion of the ancients that love affairs were being carried on among the planetary gods and
goddesses is a

"romances" the goddess Venus (Aphrodite) became associated in mythology with the moon as
well as with the planet of that name.

tale for the common people and a philosophical metaphor for the instructed.
The great seas of dried lava and the great craters on the dead planet devoid of air and water
bespeak the dreadful devastations, even death itself, that interplanetary contacts can leave in their
wake. The great formations of craters, mountains, rifts, and plains of lava on the moon were
formed not only in the upheavals described in this book, but also in those which took place in
earlier times. The moon is a great unmarked cemetery flying around our earth, a reminder of
what can happen to a planet.
The Planet Mars

robin-bobin

The planet Mars, at the present time, completes one revolution around the sun in 687 terrestrial
days. Its orbit is entirely outside the earth's orbit, and is an ellipse, like that of the earth, but more
stretched out, so that the planet's distance from the sun varies considerably during a revolution.
When Mars and the earth are on different sides of the sun, the distance between them rises to
over 200,000,000 miles and may reach 248,600,000 miles. From this moment on, as the distance
between the two planets diminishes, Mars nightly grows more and more luminous, changing
from an inconspicuous point of light to a most brilliant star, brighter than any fixed star. During a
period of little more than a year, it grows fifty-five times brighter. Among the planets it exceeds
then even Jupiter in brilliance.
The earth and Mars approach each other every 780 days, this being the synodical period of Mars.
But because of the ellipticity of the two orbits and the difference in the direction in which their
longer radii are turned, the closeness of Mars and the earth is not the same at every opposition.
At each seventh approach, which occurs every fifteen years, when Mars passes through that part
of its orbit which is closest to the sun, and the earth simultaneously passes the segment of its
orbit which is farthest from the sun, the conjunction of the two planets is especially close and is
"the favorable opposition." These occasions are eagerly awaited by astronomers, for no celestial
body,
WORLDS IN COLLISION
363
with the exception of the moon, is more readily observable than Mars when at "favorable
opposition."
The distance between Mars and the earth at the oppositions varies from 61,000,000 miles to
35,500,000 miles ("favorable opposition"); the distance at various times during the period of
fifteen years varies greatly, from 248,600,000 to 35,500,000 miles.
Two cosmic disturbances recorded by Hebrew tradition—one on the day when Hezekiah's father,
Ahaz, was entombed; the other, when Sennacherib's army invaded Palestine—were separated by
a period of fourteen or fifteen years, if the figure in II Kings 18 : 13 refers to the invasion which
ended in the disaster. A seemingly arbitrary period of fifteen years of grace, mentioned in Isaiah
38 : 5 and in II Kings 20 : 6, may also have had some relation to the periodicity of the
catastrophes. The years -776, -747, -717 or -702, and -687 apparently were years of favorable
oppositions of Mars, when perturbations, a regular phenomenon in oppositions, reached
catastrophic dimensions.
If, because of other reasons, contact between Mars and the earth in the past is admitted, the
combined shape of the orbits, with points of nearest approach being reached at present every
fifteen years, could be regarded as a vestige of a contact or series of contacts at similar intervals
in the past between the two planets then revolving on curved orbits that were closer to each
other.
Mars bears a striking resemblance to the earth in the inclination of its axis of rotation to the plane
of its orbit and in the period of its diurnal rotation. Whereas the equator of the earth is inclined
23% degrees to the plane of the ecliptic, the equator of Mars is inclined 24 degrees to the plane
of its orbit, a similarity unequaled among other planets in the solar system. The mean time of
axial rotation of the earth is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds, that of Mars 24 hours, 37 minutes,
23 seconds. No other two planets are so alike in the duration of their day, conceding that no
conclusive data are available for the length of the day on Venus.
Is it possible that the axis of rotation and the velocity of rotation of Mars, stabilized and
supported in their present position and rate
364
WORLDS IN COLLISION
by certain forces, were influenced originally by the earth at the time of contact? Mars, being
small as compared with the earth, influenced to a lesser degree the rotation of the earth and the
position of its poles.
The surface of Mars is crisscrossed with a network of "canals." Their discoverer, Schiaparelli,
assumed that geological forces were a factor in their formation; on the other hand, he was "very

robin-bobin

careful not to combat this supposition, which includes nothing impossible," of the presence of
intelligent beings on Mars who could have built these canals.
Percival Lowell spent his life in a crusade to convince fellow scholars and other contemporaries
that intelligent human beings live on Mars and that the canals are their work. From his
observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, he believed he discovered water on Mars. He interpreted the
polar caps as ice masses; because of the dearth of water, the intelligent beings dug the canals to
bring water to desert areas.1
In the early years of the twentieth century, plans were devised to communicate by light signals
with the hypothetical men on Mars; according to one plan a series of light-sending stations was
to be built into a geometric figure on the planes of Siberia. The figure was to represent the
Pythagorean theorem of the relation of the three sides of a right-angle triangle. If there are
intelligent beings on Mars, some writers argued, they should be able to notice and interpret the
signals; if they are not intelligent enough to notice the signals and understand their meaning, we
should not be so eager to communicate with them. The experiment was not carried out.
The contacts of Mars with other planets larger than itself and more powerful make it highly
improbable that any higher forms of life, if they previously existed there, survived on Mars. It is,
rather, a dead planet; every higher form of life, of whatever kind it might have been, most
probably had its Last Day. Their work could not survive either. The "canals" on Mars appear to
be a result of the play of geo-ip. Lowell, Mars (3rd ed., 1897); idem, Mars and Its Canals (1906).

logical forces that answered with rifts and cracks the outer forces acting in collisions.
The Atmosphere of Mars
The atmosphere of Mars is invisible. If there are any living creatures on that planet, and if they
are endowed with organs of sight, they see a black sky, not a blue one as we do.
The atmosphere of Mars was the object of many investigations which produced conflicting and
apparently unsatisfactory results. This gaseous envelope is transparent, permitting clear
observation on the contours of the planet. Mars' seasonal polar caps are products of distillation: a
polar cap disappears when summer arrives in its hemisphere and reappears in winter. It is not
known whether these caps are composed of carbon dioxide or of ice, whether they are clouds
floating over polar regions or layers of coagulated masses.
The general question as to the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars was answered
in the affirmative by one group of observers (Lowell Observatory), and in the negative by
another group (Lick Observatory). At present it is regarded as almost certain that there is on
Mars only a low absolute content of water vapor, about one-twentieth of that in the atmosphere
of the earth. This is the view supported by results announced by astronomers at Mount Wilson
Observatory.
The observations concerning oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars are somewhat inconclusive; it is
generally supposed that oxygen on Mars, if there is any, is less than 0.1 per cent of the oxygen
content in the atmosphere of the earth per unit of surface area.1
The difficulty of a spectral analysis of the atmosphere of the planets lies in the fact that their
light is the reflected light of the sun, and consequently it has in it the spectral picture of the
atmosphere of the sun (emission lines of the spectrum), and also in the fact that the atmosphere
of the earth, through which this reflected light travels, impresses its own characteristic spectral
lines (of absorption) on the

light reflected from the planets. The conclusion drawn and communicated to the general public is
that "Mars' spectrum is practically that of reflected sunlight only" (E. Doolittle). This would
suggest that there is no atmosphere on Mars or that it is very tenuous. However, there is a change
in the distribution of light through the spectrum as compared with the light that arrives directly
from the sun. The presence of an atmosphere on Mars can be proved by another set of

robin-bobin

observations, which indicate that it extends to about sixty miles above the surface of the planet.
Also, its supposed thinness is in contradiction to findings obtained by photographs made in violet
and in red fight. One series of clouds is seen in the photographs taken in violet light, but not in
those taken in red light; a second series of clouds is seen in the red, but not in the violet, light.
In the present study of cosmic catastrophes the endeavor has been to establish the fact that in the
eighth and seventh centuries before this era the earth was repeatedly approached by a celestial
body; that this body was the planet Mars; that previously Mars had been displaced from its path
by contact with Venus, which up to that time had crossed the orbit of the earth, and that Venus,
the earth, and Mars, as a consequence, assumed new positions in the solar system. In all these
contacts between Venus, the earth, and Mars there was an exchange of atmospheres, the earth
acquiring the carbon clouds of Venus and also some of the atmosphere of Mars. The white
precipitated masses on Mars, which form the polar caps, are probably of the nature of carbon,
having been acquired from the trailing part of Venus, and only the difference in atmospheric
conditions on Mars as compared with the earth, together with a difference in temperature, keeps
this "manna" from being permanently dissolved under the rays of the sun.
The main ingredients of the atmosphere of Mars must be present in the atmosphere of the earth.
Mars, "the god of war," must have left part of his property on his visits. As oxygen and water
vapor are not the main ingredients of the atmosphere of Mars, some other elements of the
terrestrial atmosphere must be the main components of its atmosphere. It could be nitrogen, but
the presence of nitrogen on Mars—or its absence—has not yet been established.
WORLDS IN COLLISION
367
Besides oxygen and nitrogen, the main components of the terrestrial atmosphere, argon and neon
are present in detectable quantities in the air. These rare gases excite spectral lines only when in
a hot state; consequently, they cannot be detected through lines of emission from a
comparatively cool body such as Mars. The absorption lines of argon and neon have not yet been
investigated. When a study of these lines will make possible a spectral search for these rare gases
on planets, Mars should be submitted to the test. If analysis should reveal them in rich amounts,
this would also answer the question: What contribution did Mars make to the earth when the two
planets came into contact?
The Thermal Balance of Mars
The equatorial diameter of Mars is about 4,200 miles; when compared with that of the earth, the
ratio in volume is 15 to 100; the ratio in mass is supposed to be 10.8 to 100. Mars is one-sixth the
volume of Venus, and Venus is considered to be seven and a half times heavier than Mars.
Due to the eccentricity of Mars' orbit, the insolation at aphelion is much smaller than at
perihelion (the ratio being about 5:6), and in the southern hemisphere the summer is much hotter
but much shorter than in the northern hemisphere. Because of the greater mean distance of Mars
from the sun, it is supposed to receive less than half the light and warmth per unit of area that the
earth receives; and for this reason its temperature must be some 65° C. below that of the earth,
and never above freezing. The mean temperature of a year on the equatorial latitudes of Mars
must be similar to that of the polar regions of the earth.
The radiometric measurement of the temperature of Mars actually
shows an excess of heat.1 Mars emits more heat than it receives from
the sun. Does this excess of heat come from the interior of the planet?
Mars is a smaller body than the earth; it has more surface per unit
of volume, and it must have cooled down quicker than the earth,
especially if it was released from the nebulous sun by a centrifugal

force before the earth was (Kant-Laplace), but also if they both originated as planets
simultaneously millions of years ago (tidal theory). What, then, is the cause of the excess of heat
in Mars?

robin-bobin

The assumed contacts with the earth would have caused much greater changes in and on Mars
than in and on the earth, because of the difference in mass. An interplanetary contact must have
caused a conversion of motion into heat, and consequently resulted in an excess of thermal
radiation over the quantity of heat brought to the planet by insolation.
The contacts of Mars with Venus, and in a lesser degree with the earth, less than three thousand
years ago probably are responsible for the present temperature of Mars; interplanetary electric
discharges could also initiate atomic fissions with ensuing radioactivity and emission of heat.
The Gases of Venus
A part of the gaseous trail of Venus remained attached to the earth, another part was torn away
by Mars, but the main mass of gases followed the head of the comet. Of the part which remained
with the earth, some became a deposit of petroleum; some, in the form of clouds, enveloped the
earth for many years, slowly precipitating. The part retained by Venus burned or smoked for a
long time, as long as the oxygen carried from the earth lasted; what remained forms today the
envelope of carbon clouds of the Morning Star. To the depth penetrated by spectroscopic
analysis, oxygen and water vapor are absent. The planet is covered with clouds of dust. Carbon
dioxide is an ingredient of Venus' atmosphere.1
The brilliant envelope of Venus is the remnant of its tail of the days when, three thousand years
ago, it was a comet. The reflecting power (albedo) of Venus is greater than that of any other
planet.

Wilson Observatory, No. 249 (1922).
The supposition has been advanced that Venus is covered with formaldehyde (R. Wildt)
although no spectral lines of this compound have been identified in the atmosphere of Venus.

369
It is 0.75 as compared with 0.22 for Mars, and 0.13 for the moon.2 The reflecting capacity of
Venus is not only much greater than that of desert sand, but is almost equal to that of newly
fallen snow.
On the basis of this research, I assume that Venus must be rich in petroleum gases. If and as long
as Venus is too hot for the liquefaction of petroleum, the hydrocarbons will circulate in gaseous
form. The absorption lines of the hydrocarbon spectrum lie far in the infrared where usual
photographs do not reach. When the technique of photography in the infrared is perfected so that
hydrocarbon bands can be differentiated, the spectrogram of Venus may disclose the presence of
hydrocarbon gases in its atmosphere, if these gases lie in the upper part of the atmosphere where
the rays of the sun penetrate.
If the petroleum that poured down on the earth on its contact with the comet Venus was formed
by means of electrical discharges from hydrogen and gaseous carbon, Venus must still have
petroleum because of the discharges that passed, as we assume, between the head and tail of the
comet when it was intercepted by the earth and in other celestial contacts.
Some indirect conclusion can also be drawn concerning the presence of liquid petroleum on
Jupiter. If, as is assumed here, Venus was thrown off from Jupiter in a violent expulsion, and if
Venus has petroleum gases, then Jupiter must have petroleum. The fact that methane has been
discovered in the atmosphere of Jupiter—the only known constituents of its atmosphere are the
poisonous gases methane and ammonia—makes it rather probable that it has petroleum; the socalled "natural gas" found in and near oil fields consists largely of methane.
The modern theory of the origin of petroleum, based upon its polarizing quality, regards
petroleum as originating from organic, not inorganic, matter. Consequently, if I am not mistaken,
Venus and Jupiter must possess an organic source of petroleum. On preceding pages it was
shown that there are some historical indications that Venus—and therefore also Jupiter—is
populated by vermin; this organic life can be the source of petroleum.

The Thermal Balance of Venus
Radiometric observations at the Mount Wilson and Flagstaff observatories in 1922 have shown
that "a considerable amount of heat" is emitted by the dark part of the disc of the planet Venus.
Venus, being nearer to the sun than the earth, turns in succession its illuminated and shaded parts
toward the earth: it shows phases like the moon. The temperature of the day and night sides of
Venus was measured by a radiometric method and it was found that there is "a nearly uniform
temperature over the planet's surface both on the illuminated and dark hemispheres." "This
sentence [of E. Pettit and S. B. Nicholson] is a terse statement of what is perhaps the most
valuable single discovery ever made with respect to the planet Venus." * Similar results were
also obtained independently and almost simultaneously by a second pair of researchers.2
What explanation can be given for the phenomenon of the nearly uniform temperature of the day
and night hemispheres of Venus? The conclusion drawn was this: The daily rotation of the planet
Venus is very rapid and during the short night the temperature cannot fall to any considerable
extent. But this conclusion stands in complete contradiction to what was believed to be the
established fact of the nonrotation of Venus (with respect to the sun, or of a rotation in relation to
the fixed stars with a period equal to the time of one revolution on its planetary orbit or 225
terrestrial days). Due to the cover of clouds over Venus, it is impossible to have a direct
impression as to whether Venus has a day-night rotation or not. The spectro-graphic data suggest
that the planet revolves always with the same side to the sun, just as the moon revolves always
with the same side to the earth, or that, at most, it rotates very slowly.3 In any case, a short
period of rotation is excluded by the spectrographic data.
"If the period of rotation of Venus is 225 days, as many observers

371
have been led to believe, it is difficult to see how the high temperature of the rotating layer of the
night side can be maintained." 4
Compromise does not satisfy either side. Neither the radiometric data, which suggest a short
period of rotation, nor the precise spec-troscopic data, which indicate a long period of rotation,
may be ignored, and "they will undoubtedly furnish material for discussion and debate for many
years." "
In reality there is no conflict between the two methods of physical observation. The night side of
Venus radiates heat because Venus is hot. The reflecting, absorbing, insulating, and conducting
properties of the cloud layer of Venus modify the heating effect of the sun upon the body of the
planet; but at the bottom of the problem lies this fact: Venus gives off heat.
Venus experienced in quick succession its birth and expulsion under violent conditions; an
existence as a comet on an ellipse which approached the sun closely; two encounters with the
earth accompanied by discharges of potentials between these two bodies and with a thermal
effect caused by conversion of momentum into heat; a number of contacts with Mars, and
probably also with Jupiter. Since all this happened between the third and first millennia before
the present era, the core of the planet Venus must still be hot. Moreover, if there is oxygen
present on Venus, petroleum fires must be burning there.
These conclusions are drawn from the history of Venus as established in this research.
The End
This world will be destroyed; also the mighty ocean will dry up; and this broad earth will be
burnt up. Therefore, sirs, cultivate friendliness; cultivate compassion.

curred in historical times. Nor is there justification for the excuse that man cannot know or find
out how this system came into being because he was not there when it was arranged in its present
pattern.
Catastrophes have repeatedly reduced civilization on this earth to ruins. But our earth has fared
well in comparison with Mars; and judged by the state of civilization at which mankind has
arrived, conditions for life processes have been improved in some respects. But if events of this
kind happened in the past, they may happen again in the future, with perhaps a different—fatal—
result.
The earth has come in contact with other planets and comets. At present no planet has a course
that endangers the earth, and only a few asteroids—mere rocks, a few kilometers in diameter—
have orbits that cross the path of the earth. This was discovered, to the amazement of scholars,
only recently. But in the solar system there exists a possibility that at some date in the future a
collision between two planets will occur, not a mere encounter between a planet and an asteroid.
The orbit of Pluto, the farthest of the planets from the sun, though much larger than Neptune's,
crosses that of Neptune. True, the plane of the orbit of Pluto is inclined 17° to the ecliptic, and
therefore the danger of a collision is not impending. However, since the long axis of Pluto's orbit
changes its direction, future contact between the two planets is probable if no comet intervenes
to disrupt the intersecting orbits of these bodies. Astronomers will see the planets stop or slow
down in their rotation, cushioned in the magnetic fields about them; a spark will fly from one
planet to another, and thus an actual crushing collision of the lithospheres will be avoided; then
the planets will part and change their orbits. It may happen that Pluto will become a satellite of
Neptune. There is also the possibility that Pluto may encounter, not Neptune, but Triton,
Neptune's satellite and about one-third as large as Pluto. Whether Pluto will become another
moon of Neptune or will be thrown into a position much closer to the sun, or whether it will free
Triton from being a satellite are matters of conjecture.
Another case of intersection may be found among the moons of Jupiter. The orbit of the sixth
satellite is interlocked with the orbit of the seventh, and the eighth satellite is highly erratic and
crosses
WORLDS IN COLLISION
373
the path of the ninth. One should be able to calculate how long the sixth and seventh satellites
have moved on their present paths; the figures will probably not be large.
Each collision between two planets in the past caused a series of subsequent collisions, in which
other planets became involved. The collision between major planets, which is the theme of the
sequel to Worlds in Collision, brought about the birth of comets. These comets moved across the
orbits of other planets and collided with them. At least one of these comets in historical times
became a planet (Venus), and this at the cost of great destruction on Mars and on the earth.
Planets, thrown off their paths, collided repeatedly until they attained their present positions,
where their orbits do not intersect. The only remaining cases of intersection are those of Neptune
and Pluto, the satellites of Jupiter, and some planetoids (asteroids) that cross the orbits of Mars
and the earth.
Moreover, comets may strike the earth, as Venus did when it was a comet; in that major
catastrophe it was fortunate that Venus is a. slightly smaller body than the earth. A large comet
arriving from interstellar spaces may run into one of the planets and push it from its orbit; then
chaos may start anew. Also, some dark star, like Jupiter or Saturn, may be in the path of the sun,
and may be attracted to the system and cause havoc in it.
The scholarly world assumed that in some hundreds of millions of years the heat of the sun
would be exhausted, and then, as Flam-marion frightened his readers, the last pair of human
beings would freeze to death in the ice of the equator. But this is far off in the future. In view of
modern knowledge that heat is discharged in the process of breaking up atoms, scientists are now
prepared to credit the sun with an immense reserve of heat. The fear, if any, is focused on the
possibility that the sun may explode; a few minutes later the earth will become aware of this, and

robin-bobin

soon thereafter will no longer exist. But the one end, that of freezing, is very remote; the other
end, that of explosion, is very improbable; and the world is thought to have billions of peaceful
years ahead. It is believed that the world has gone through eons of undisturbed evolution, and
equally long eons are before us. Man can go far in such a span of
374
WORLDS IN COLLISION
time, considering that his entire civilization has endured less than ten thousand years, and in
view of the great technological progress he has made in the last century.
The average man is no longer afraid of the end of the world. Man clings to his earthly
possessions, registers his landholdings and fences them in; peoples carry on wars to preserve and
to enlarge their historical frontiers. Yet the last five or six thousand years have witnessed a series
of major catastrophes, each of which displaced the borders of the seas, and some of which
caused sea-beds and continents to interchange places, submerging kingdoms, and creating space
for new ones.
Cosmic collisions are not divergent phenomena, or phenomena that, in the opinion of some
modern philosophers, take place in defiance of what is supposed to be physical laws; they are
more in the nature of occurrences implicit in the dynamics of the universe, or, in terms of that
philosophy, convergent phenomena.
"Lest by chance restrained by religion,"—and we may read 'science' instead of 'religion'—"you
should think that earth and sun, and sky, sea, stars, and moon must needs abide for everlasting,
because of their divine body," think of the catastrophes of the past; and then "look upon seas, and
lands, and sky; their threefold nature . . . then-three textures so vast, one single day shall hurl to
ruin; and the massive form and fabric of the world held up for many years, shall fall headlong."1
"And the whole firmament shall fall on the divine earth and on tne sea: and then shall flow a
ceaseless cataract of raging fire, and shall burn land and sea, and the firmament of heaven and
the stars and creation itself it shall cast into one molten mass and clean dissolve. Then no more
shall there be the luminaries' twinkling orbs, no night, no dawn, no constant days of care, no
spring, no summer, no winter, no autumn."2
"A single day will see the burial of all mankind. All that the long forbearance of fortune has
produced, all that has been reared to eminence, all that is famous and all that is beautiful, great

EPILOGUE
EPILOGUE
Facing Many Problems
IN THIS BOOK, containing the first part of a historical cosmology, I have endeavored to show
that two series of cosmic catastrophes took place in historical times, thirty-four and twenty-six
centuries ago, and thus only a short time ago not peace but war reigned in the solar system.
All cosmological theories assume that the planets have revolved m their places for billions of
years; we claim that they have been traveling along their present orbits for only a few thousand
years. We maintain also that one planet—Venus—was formerly a comet and that it joined the
family of planets within the memory of mankind, thus offering an explanation of how one of the
planets originated. We conjectured that the comet Venus originated in the planet Jupiter; then we
found that smaller comets were born in contacts between Venus and Mars, thus offering an
explanation of the principle of the origin of the comets of the solar system. That these comets are
only a few thousand years old explains why, despite dissipation of the material of their tails in
space, they have not yet disintegrated entirely. From the fact that Venus was once a comet we

robin-bobin

learned that comets are not nearly immaterial bodies or "rien visible," as was thought because
stars are usually seen through their tails and, on the passage of one or two of them in front of the
sun, their heads were not perceptible.
We claim that the earth's orbit changed more than once and with it the length of the year; that the
geographical position of the terrestrial axis and its astronomical direction changed repeatedly,
and that at a recent date the polar star was in the constellation of the Great Bear. The length of
the day altered; the polar regions shifted,
379
380
WORLDS IN COLLISION
the polar ice became displaced into moderate latitudes, and other regions moved into the polar
circles.
We arrived at the conclusion that electrical discharges took place between Venus, Mars, and the
earth when, in very close contacts, their atmospheres touched each other; that the magnetic poles
of the earth became reversed only a few thousand years ago; and that with the change in the
moon's orbit, the length of the month changed too, and repeatedly so. In the period of seven
hundred years between the middle of the second millennium before the present era and the eighth
century the year consisted of 360 days and the month of almost exactly thirty days, but earlier
the day, month, and year were of different lengths.
We offered an explanation of the fact that the nocturnal side of Venus emits as much heat as the
sunlit side; and we explained the origin of the canals of Mars and of the craters and seas of lava
on the moon as brought about in stress and near collisions.
We believe we came close to solving the problem of mountain building and the irruption of the
sea; the exchange of place between sea and land; the rise of new islands and volcanic activity;
sudden changes in climate and the destruction of quadrupeds in northern Siberia and the
annihilation of entire species; and the cause of earthquakes.
Furthermore, we found that excessive evaporation of water from the surface of the oceans and
seas, a phenomenon that was postulated to explain excessive precipitation and formation of ice
covers, was caused by extraterrestrial agents. Though in such occurrences we see the origin of
the Fimbul winter, we are inclined to regard the erratic boulders and till, or gravel, clay, and sand
on the substratum of rock as having been carried, not by ice, but by onrushing gigantic tides
caused by change in the rotation of the terrestrial globe; thus have we accounted for moraines
that migrated from the equator toward higher latitudes and altitudes (Himalayas) or from the
equator across Africa toward the South Pole.
We recognized that the religions of the peoples of the world have a common astral origin. The
narrative of the Hebrew Bible concerning the plagues and other wonders of the time of the
Exodus is
WORLDS IN COLLISION
381
historically true and the prodigies recorded have a natural explanation. We learned that there was
a world conflagration and that naphtha poured from the sky; that only a small proportion of
people and animals survived; that the passage of the sea and the the-ophany at Mount Sinai are
not inventions; that the shadow of death or twilight of the gods (Gotterdammerung) refers to the
time of the wandering in the desert; that manna or ambrosia really fell from the sky, from the
clouds of Venus.
We found also that Joshua's miracle with the sun and the moon is not a tale for the credulous. We
learned why there are common ideas in the folklore of peoples separated by oceans, and we
recognized the importance of world upheavals in the content of legends and why the planets
were deified and which planet was represented by Pallas Athene, and what is the celestial plot of
the Iliad and in what period this epic was created, and why the Roman people made Mars their
national god and progenitor of the founders of Rome. We came to understand the real meaning
of the messages of the Hebrew prophets Amos, Isaiah, Joel, Micah, and others. We were able
also to ascertain the year, month, and day of the last cosmic catastrophe and to establish the

robin-bobin

nature of the agent that destroyed Sennacherib's army. We discerned the cause of the great
wanderings of peoples in the fifteenth and eighth centuries. We learned the origin of the belief in
the chosenness of the Jewish people; we traced the original meaning of the archangels, and the
source of eschatological beliefs in doomsday.
In giving this enumeration of the claims made and problems dealt with in this book, we are
aware that more problems have arisen than have been solved.
The question before historical cosmogony is this: If it is true that cosmic catastrophes occurred
such a short time ago, how about the more remote past? What can we find out concerning the
Deluge, at present thought to have been a local flooding of the Euphrates that impressed the
Bedouins coming from the desert? In general, what can be brought to light concerning the
world's more distant past and earlier celestial battles?
As explained in the Preface, the story of catastrophes as they can be reconstructed from the
records of man and of nature is not completed in this volume. Here are presented only two
chapters—two world ages—Venus and Mars. I intend to go further back into the past and piece
together the story of some earlier cosmic upheavals. This will be the subject of another volume.
There I hope to be able to tell a little more of the circumstances preceding the birth of Venus
from the body of Jupiter and narrate at length why Jupiter, a planet which only a few persons out
of a crowd know how to find in the sky, was the main deity of the peoples of antiquity. In that
book an attempt will be made to answer some more of the questions raised in the first pages of
the Prologue of this volume.
Historical cosmogony offers a chance to employ the fact that there were catastrophes of global
extent in establishing a synchronized history of the ancient world. Previous efforts to build
chronological tables on the basis of astronomical calculations—new moons, eclipses, heliacal
rising or culmination of certain stars—cannot be correct because the order of nature has changed
since ancient times. But great upheavals of cosmic character may serve as points of departure for
writing a revised history of the nations.
Such a synchronization of the histories of the ancient world is attempted in Ages in Chaos. Its
starting point is the simultaneity of physical catastrophes in the countries of the ancient East and
the comparison of records referring to such catastrophes among the peoples of antiquity. For the
rest, I have proceeded by collating political records and archeological material of the ancient
East covering a period of over a thousand years, from the end of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt
to the time of Alexander of Macedonia: going step by step from century to century, the research
arrives at an entirely revised sequence of events in ancient history and discloses a discrepancy of
a number of centuries in the conventional chronology.
The development of religion, including the religion of Israel, comes under a new light. The facts
established here may help in tracing the origin and the growth of planetary worship, animal
worship, human sacrifices—also the source of astrological beliefs. The author feels an obligation
to expand the scope of his work in order to include the problem of the birth of religion and of
monotheism
WORLDS IN COLLISION
383
in particular. Investigation should be made into why and how the Jewish people, who had the
same experiences as other peoples and who started with an astral religion like the rest of the
nations, early cast off astral deities and forbade the worship of images.
The Scriptures invite a new approach to Bible criticism, one that will make it possible to see the
process of transition from an astral religion to monotheism with its idea of a single Creator, not a
star, not an animal, and not a human being.
An intriguing problem presents itself in psychology. Freud searched for primordial urges in
modern man. According to him, in the primitive society of the stone age, when the sons grew up,
they looked for a chance to dispose of the father, once all-powerful and now aging, and to work
their will on their mother; and this urge is part of the heritage that modern man carries over from
his prehistoric ancestors. According to the theory of another psychologist, Carl Jung, there exists
a collective unconscious mind, a receptacle and carrier of ideas deposited there in primeval

robin-bobin

times, which plays an important role in our concepts and actions. In the light of these theories,
we may well wonder to what extent the terrifying experiences of world catastrophes have
become part of the human soul and how much, if any, of it can be traced in our beliefs, emotions,
and behavior as directed from the unconscious or subconscious strata of the mind.1
In the present volume geological and paleontological material was discussed only occasionally—
when we dealt with rocks being carried considerable distances and placed on top of foreign
formations; with mammoths being killed in a catastrophe; with the changes of climate, the
geographical contours of the polar ice in the past, moraines in Africa, and remains of human
culture in the north of Alaska; with the source of a substantial part of oil deposits, the origin of
volcanoes, the cause of earthquakes. However, geological, paleontological, and anthropological
material related to the problems of cosmic catastrophes is vast and may give a complete picture
of past events no less than historical material.
1 In connection with my idea of collective amnesia, G. A. Atwater suggests a search for the
vestiges of terrifying experiences of the past in the present behavior of man.

What can we establish concerning the disappearance of species and even of genera, the theory of
evolution versus the theory of catastrophic mutations, and the development of animal and plant
life in general, or the time when giants lived or when brontosauri populated the earth?
The submersion and emersion of land, the origin of the salt in the sea, the origin of deserts, of
gravel, of coal deposits in Antarctica, and the palm growth in the arctic regions; the building of
sedimentary rocks; the intrusion of igneous rock above levels containing bones of marine and
land animals and of iron in the superficial layers of the earth's crust, the times of geological
epochs and the age of man on the earth—all these ask for treatment in the light of the theory of
cosmic catastrophism.
Then there are physical problems. The accounts given in this book about planets changing their
orbits and the velocities of their rotation, about a comet that became a planet, about
interplanetary contacts and discharges, indicate a need for a new approach to celestial mechanics.
The theory of cosmic catastrophism can, if required to do so, conform with the celestial
mechanics of Newton. Comets and planets pushing one another could change their orbits,
although it is singular how, for instance, Venus could achieve a circular orbit, or how the moon,
also forced from its place, could hold to an almost circular orbit. Nevertheless, there are
precedents for such a concept. The planetesimal theory postulates innumerable collisions
between small planetesimals—that flew out of the sun, gradually rounded their orbits, and
formed planets and satellites; the tidal theory also regards the planets as derivatives of the sun
swept by a passing star into a direction and with a force that, together with the gravitational
attraction of the sun, created nearly circular orbits, the same having occurred to the moons in
relation to their parent planets.2 Another precedent for circular orbits formed under extraordinary
circumstances can be found in the theory that regards the retrograde
2 One of the authors of the tidal theory, Harold Jeffreys, writes that first among the "several
striking facts" which "still remain unexplained" by the tidal theory is "the smallness of the
eccentricities of the orbits of the planets and satellites" (The Earth, 2nd ed. [1929], p. 48).

satellites as captured asteroids which succeeded, after being captured, in achieving
approximately circular orbits.
If such effects from contacts between two stars or from capture of a smaller body by a larger
body are not incompatible with celestial mechanics, then the orbits resulting from worlds in
collision should be regarded as in harmony with it, too.
The physical effects of retardation or reversal of the earth in its diurnal rotation are differently
evaluated by various scientists. Some express the opinion that a total destruction of the earth and
volatilization of its entire mass would follow such slowing down or stasis. They concede,
however, that destruction of such dimensions would not occur if the earth continued to rotate and
only its axis were tilted out of its position. This could be caused by the earth's passing through a
strong magnetic field at an angle to the earth's magnetic axis. A rotating steel top, when tilted by
a magnet, continues to rotate. Theoretically, the terrestrial axis could be tilted for a certain length
of time, and at any angle, and also in such a fashion that it would lie in the plane of the ecliptic.
In that case, one of the two hemispheres —the northern or the southern—would remain in
prolonged day, the other, in prolonged night.
The tilting of the axis could produce the visual effect of a retrogressing or arrested sun; a greater
tilting, a multiple day or night; and in the case of still greater tilting, a reversal of poles with east
and west exchanging places; all this without a substantial disruption in the mechanical
momentum of the rotation or revolution of the earth.
Other scientists maintain that a theoretical slowing down or even stoppage of the earth in its
diurnal rotation would not by itself cause the destruction of the earth. All parts of the earth rotate
with the same angular velocity, and if the theoretical stoppage or slowing down did not upset the
equality of the angular velocity of the various parts of the solid globe, the earth would survive
the slowing down, or stasis, or even a reversal of rotation. However, the fluid parts—the air and
the water of the oceans—would certainly have their angular velocity disrupted, and hurricanes
and tidal waves would sweep the earth. Civilizations would be destroyed, but not the globe.
386
WORLDS IN COLLISION
According to this explanation, the actual results of such a slowing down of the angular velocity
of rotation would depend on the manner in which it occurred. If the application of an external
medium, say a thick cloud of dust, acted equally on all parts of the surface of the globe, the globe
would change its speed of rotation or might even cease rotating, and the energy of its rotation
would be transferred to the cloud of dust; heat would develop as the result of the bombardment
by the particles of dust striking the atmosphere and the ground. The earth would be buried under
such a thick layer of dust that its mass would noticeably increase.
The cessation of the diurnal rotation could also be caused—and most efficiently—by the earth's
passing through a strong magnetic field; eddy currents would be generated in the surface of the
earth,3 which in turn would give rise to magnetic fields, and these, interacting with the external
field, would slow down the earth or bring it to a rotational stasis.
It is possible to calculate the mass of a cloud of particles and also the strength of the magnetic
field that would cause the earth to stop rotating or to slow down, say, to half its original
rotational velocity. A rough calculation shows that if the mass of this cloud were equal to the
mass of the earth and consisted of iron particles magnetized close to saturation, it would create a
magnetic field strong enough to stop the rotation of the earth; if the magnetic field were half as
strong it would slow the rotation of the earth to half its original velocity. However, if the cloud
were electrically charged, the strength of its magnetic field would depend on its charge.
If the interaction with the magnetic field caused the earth to renew its spinning, it would almost
certainly not be renewed at the same speed. If the magma inside the globe continued to rotate at a
different angular velocity than the shell, it would tend to set the earth rotating slowly. In the tidal
theory the origin of the earth's rotation is ascribed to the action of meteorites.
3 In this connection see the description of a sudden calamity in Numbers 16 : 45-49, in which
thousands of Israelites roaming in the desert were "consumed as in a moment."

387
If the angular velocity of the various strata or segments of the globe were disrupted by some
stress, these strata or segments would shift, and heat would be created as the result of the
friction. Cracks and rifts would appear, seas would erupt, land would submerge or rise in
mountain ridges, with "the midmost of the earth trembling with terror and the upper layers of the
earth falling away." 4
The stresses between the various strata that would result in all this might also convert some of
the energy of rotation, not into heat, but into other forms of energy, including electrical. A
discharge of great magnitude between the earth and the outer body (or cloud) could take place in
this way.

Thus celestial mechanics does not conflict with cosmic catastro-phism. I must admit, however,
that in searching for the causes of the great upheavals of the past and in considering their effects,
I became skeptical of the great theories concerning the celestial motions that were formulated
when the historical facts described here were not known to science. The subject deserves to be
discussed in detail and quantitatively. All that I would venture to say at this time and in this place
is the following: The accepted celestial mechanics, notwithstanding the many calculations that
have been carried out to many decimal places, or verified by celestial motions, stands only if the
sun, the source of light, warmth, and other radiation produced by fusion and fission of atoms, is
as a whole an electrically neutral body, and also if the planets, in their usual orbits, are neutral
bodies.
Fundamental principles in celestial mechanics including the law of gravitation, must come into
question if the sun possesses a charge sufficient to influence the planets in their orbits or the
comets in theirs. In the Newtonian celestial mechanics, based on the theory of gravitation,
electricity and magnetism play no role.
When physicists came upon the idea that the atom is built like a solar system, the atoms of
various chemical elements differing in the mass of their suns (nuclei) and the number of their
planets (electrons), the notion was looked upon with much favor. But it was stressed that "an
atom differs from the solar system by the fact that * See p. 74.
388
WORLDS IN COLLISION
it is not gravitation that makes the electrons go round the nucleus, but electricity" (H. N.
Russell).
Besides this, another difference was found: an electron in an atom, on absorbing the energy of a
photon (light), jumps to another orbit, and again to another when it emits light and releases the
energy of a photon. Because of this phenomenon, comparison with the solar system no longer
seemed valid. "We do not read in the morning newspapers that Mars leaped to the orbit of
Saturn, or Saturn to the orbit of Mars," wrote a critic. True, we do not read it in the morning
papers; but in ancient records we have found similar events described in detail, and we have tried
to reconstruct the facts by comparing many ancient records. The solar system is actually built
like an atom; only, in keeping with the smallness of the atom, the jumping of electrons from one
orbit to another, when hit by the energy of a photon, takes place many times a second, whereas in
accord with the vastness of the solar system, a similar phenomenon occurs there once in
hundreds or thousands of years. In the middle of the second millennium before the present era,
the terrestrial globe experienced two displacements; and in the eighth or seventh century before
the present era, it experienced three or four more. In the period between, Mars and Venus, and
the moon also, shifted.
Contacts between celestial bodies are not limited to the domain of the solar system. From time to
time a nova is seen in the sky, a blazing fixed star which until then had been small or invisible. It
burns for weeks or months and then loses its light. It is thought that this may be the result of a
collision between two stars (a phenomenon that, according to the tidal theory, occurred to the sun
or to its theoretical companion). Comets arriving from other solar systems may have been born
in such collisions.
If the activity in an atom constitutes a rule for the macrocosm, then the events described in this
book were not merely accidents of celestial traffic, but normal phenomena like birth and death.
The discharges between the planets, or the great photons emitted in these contacts, caused
metamorphoses in inorganic and organic nature. Of these things I intend to write in another
volume, where problems
WORLDS IN COLLISION
389
of geology and paleontology and the theory of evolution will be discussed.
Having discovered some historical facts and having solved a few problems, we are faced with
more problems in almost all fields of science; we are not free to stop and rest on the road on
which we started when we wondered whether Joshua's miracle of stopping the sun was a natural

robin-bobin

phenomenon. Barriers between sciences serve to create the belief in a scientist in any particular
field that other scientific fields are free from problems, and he trusts himself to borrow from
them without questioning. It can be seen here that problems in one area carry over into other
scientific areas, thought to have no contact with each other.
We realize the limitations which a single scholar must be aware of on facing such an ambitious
program of inquiry into the architectonics of the world and its history. In earlier centuries
philosophers not infrequently attempted a synthesis of knowledge in its various branches. Today,
with knowledge becoming more and more specialized, whoever tries to cope with such a task
should ask in all humility the question put at the beginning of this volume: Quota pars operis
tanti nobis committitur—Which part of this work is committed to us?
