Every institute of learning, even down to high school and lower, should own a
[Ferrocell](http://ferrocell.us/products.html)
to educate, inspire, and enlighten future
minds as to the fundamental forces of nature hidden within light and especially magnetism; which are governed by
dielectric inertia
both in whole and in part. The old method of demonstrating magnetism via iron filings is both horrible and an error
since the iron
dust undergoes magnetic induction. The only true and accurate way to see dielectricity & magnetism is with light, and
the ferrocell!

The Ferrocell is a simple, low-cost device that will scatter light in a direction determined by the application of a
magnetic field
(magnetic anisotropy). Polarized _or_ un-polarized light will reveal a representation of the applied field with a 3-D
spatial geometry in
agreement with Maxwell’s Equations. Utilizing quantum effects made possible by nanotechnology, this Ferrohydrodynamic
Lens has
the potential to enhance the performance of many existing Photonic applications.
Apply light and magnetism to either surface. The strength and orientation of the applied field will determine the
plane (angle) of
light coming out of the cell. Using a permanent magnet is the simplest way to apply a field and see how a Ferrocell will
change the
path of light. To make this event visible to the naked eye, a large surface area and strong magnetic fields are
required. Currently, there
are no demonstration units available for smaller scales. Although similar to the Faraday Effect, a Ferrocell affects
light up to 90
degrees in a single stage, whereas a Faraday rotator would require two stages to accomplish the same task.. And a
Ferrocell will
exhibit the same results with polarized or non-polarized light. Using four stages of deflection with a Ferrocell will
allow 360 degrees
of rotation.

**_Little did the creators of the Spirograph or the software designers of Überdoodle realize that this geometric
hyperboloid is the exact
divergent and convergent pattern created by magnetic field reciprocation! What does the loss of dielectric inertia
create in
centrifugal spatial vectorization (i.e. magnetism)? Why, a hypotrochoid roulette (‘spirograph’-like pattern)
polarization and the
creation of a spatial hyperboloid, of course! These images below from the T. Vanderelli ferrocell however are not
drawings, but
genuine magnetic field reciprocations as imaged by the radial dielectric torque of light in response to magnetic
divergences and
convergences. The “dielectric field”- Faraday, necessitated this formation. Now lets explain why...._**

**What you assume was known and understood about magnetism, is not, ...until now**

_Nikola Tesla November 1928 interview:
Toward the end of the interview, we asked Tesla which arena of science most appealed to him. While we expected him to
mention
radios and airplanes, the world wireless system, It was not the induction motor; instead it was the discovery of the
principle that
preceded the induction motor, the “rotating magnetic field”._ **Tesla answered:** *
*_“rotating magnetic fields were dear to my heart.
When I made the discovery of the rotating magnetic field, I was a very young man. The revelation came after years of
concentrated
thought and it was my first great thrill. It was not only a valuable discovery capable of extensive practical
applications. It was a
REVELATION OF NEW FORCES AND NEW PHENOMENA unknown to science before”.
“No”,_** _Dr. Tesla said with some feelings,_ *
*_“I would not give my rotating magnetic field discovery for a thousand inventions,
however valuable, designed merely as mechanical contraptions to deceive the eye and ear!”_**
_Then saying:_ *
*_“A thousand years hence, the telephone and the motion picture camera may be obsolete, but the principle of the
rotating magnetic field will remain a vital, living thing for all time to come.”_** **- Nikola Tesla**
Article: “A Famous Prophet of Science Looks into the Future” (Popular Science Monthly)

_Of all the types of people who have ever lived, there are only four types of gatekeepers of the mind. 1. The gatekeeper
of the mind
which lets in everything, this is the most common type in the world. 2. The gatekeeper of the mind which lets in
nothing, this is the
second most common type; of those that are sure they are right, and all others are wrong. 3. The gatekeeper of the mind
which lets in
those things it likes or agrees with and not those things it does not like or agree with, even if those things are true
and wise. This is the
third most common type. 4. The gatekeeper of the mind which judges things as wise and logical, and lets those things in,
and judges
things as unwise and irrational and bars them from entry into the mind. This type of gatekeeper of the mind is the most
sublime and
rare. Open minds are only good up to a point at which nonsense, lies, and irrational chaos is allowed to enter. Closed
minds are only
good up to a point where things wise and true are barred entry_**_._** _At this point we must agree that wholly open
minds are bad, and
wholly closed minds are equally as bad._ **_– Author_**

_“If you were to tell someone close to you that_ **_‘there is utterly no such thing as magnetic attraction’_** _, they
would inquire as to your
medication or wonder what the punch line is. The very premise, from countless thousands of years past to the present, as
evidenced
from ‘magnets’ accelerating nails, iron bits, and ferrous objects to the ‘magnet’, and ‘opposite poles
attracting/accelerating towards
each other’, is as deeply ingrained in the human consciousness as the Sun rising in the East every morning. The ancient
lie, this
perceptual titanic error is as innate as breathing. As is the case, all attraction (and ‘repulsion’) is governed by
dielectricity, not
magnetism, which is the_ **_‘dielectric field’ -Faraday_** _, which in discharging, is the radiation Ether-modality we
call magnetism. That
magnetism is reaching out in space is not in question, however radiation only displaces things, as in the case of
magnetism, causes an
inductive reaction at the interatomic magneto-dielectric of ferrous objects, thereby causing dielectric coherency from
magnetic
displacement and resultant acceleration to the ‘magnet’ as the act of dielectric voidance. Radiation attracts nothing.
Soon you will
find out the simplex nature of the “magnet” which is powered by dielectric coherency (either I.D.C. induced dielectric
coherency, or
I.D.C.C. induced dielectric capacitance and coherency) and likewise you will have a clear, lucid, logical, coherent,
proved
understanding of magnets and magnetism that explains all observed phenomena of same”_ **_- Author_**

_That the term ‘magnet’ comes from, in earliest times, the word for ‘magic’ can tell you 5000 years of the fascination
of humanity into, not magnets specifically, but their fields and action at a distance_ **_- Author_**

**_For the first time, the nature of magnetism in full detail, shall be set straight, logically, lucid, coherent,
consistent, provable, and explain all phenomena of what humans do not grasp of and about the “magnet” and magnetism._**

_“Scientists today think deeply rather than clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be
quite insane. Todays scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander thru equation after
equation, and eventually build a structure which has no basis in reality.”_ **_– Nikola Tesla_**

_“You can always recognize a relativist, they will either ask you for your credentials, or offer their credentials
without you asking for or about them.”_

_“Nothing is more fantastical and a travesty of how nature works than is quantum theory. Its very basis has no
relationship to reality.”_
**_- W. Russell_**

_“Where common sense and intuition failed, we (the insane relativists) had to create a new form of intuition based upon
abstract (unreal) mathematics. When common sense fails, we must create uncommon sense._ *

_Quantum insanity: “Everything we call real is made up of things that cannot be real.”_ **_– N. Bohr

This article is meant to be a deep but clear primer to reverse the mass of ignorance and set the reader down the correct
road
regarding magnetism and paint a clear, logical, lucid, and rational picture as to the nature of magnetism. **Its
editions will expand over
time.**
While this work will expand over time, I must state that if you cannot explain it simply then you do not really
understand
something. There are many great non-fiction books on many subjects, however all of them could be removed of superfluous
nonsense
and reduced by at least 80%, such was the premise for this article; time in life in short, and reading ten pages to find
one morsel of
truth and helpful insight, I have always found infuriating. Nothing is more hubristic than taking 100 pages to say
something that can
easily be said in 10. I state outright that for the very first time in history, I will lucidly, rationally, logically,
with reason and evidence
present you with the genuine model of magnetism, what it is, then what it really is (rather is not in principle but in
attribute), how it
moves, how it operates, with geometry, angles, charge, and unique specificity with parallel clarity.
Additionally regarding magnetism, I will supply you with numerous diagrams showing orientation, movements, pressures,
specific
angles, and countless first-time revelations about magnetism that will paint a lucid coherent picture, like a laser,
burning thru
accretions of ignorance about magnetism, to what magnetism really is, its relationship to the other 3 forces, what
induces what, what
terminates into what and as what. Lastly, and uniquely, I will present you with the correct nature of light, never
before fully
understood, formerly only half-grasped, and finally a chart showing force unification of gravity, magnetism,
dielectricity, and
electricity that is so simple, so logical, so undeniable, that even a 15 year old can grasp it; within which is included
the equation
(G.U.T.) behind all force unification.
In writing this very condensed article on magnetism after downloading and owning every book ever written on magnetism,
every
video ever made on magnetism, and growing up to know this whole time that something is completely askew about magnetism,
namely instantaneous action at a distance, how magnetism operates in a total vacuum and thru things upon other ferrous
objects, I
made an “all or nothing” desire to understand magnetism, how it works, what it works, what it really is. Rational
physics (in one
sense) was the only logical approach to understanding magnetism, the “virtual photons” explanation of quantum mysticism
is no more
rational than evoking angels or saying Atlas is holding up the world from below. These demons of mental midgetry have
invaded
science like a plague; GR and QM have, as Tesla stated, made a mockery of genuine science and clear thinking.
I have attempted to keep this article extremely lucid however I placed no work into doing same, since it naturally fell
that way
without any assistance from my own, which of course is always an extremely good sign, anytime something has to be
twisted to make
it lucid, it likely wasn’t logical or correct to begin with. I must confess to a secret in the creation of this article,
apart from owning
every book, article and video ever made on magnetism, nearly 100% of which are utterly nonsensical and
self-contradictory trash, I
used an ancient methodology with which I made myself intrinsically familiar with well over a decade ago, the same method
used by
Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus and others; a missing lost rarified art which made Plato’s and Socrates works so extremely
logical, lucid
and self consistent. That method is retroduction, not deduction or induction, but the ancient lost art of retroduction.
Using all my
experiments and many more into magnetism, I placed all this knowledge thru the Platonic prism of retroduction to draw
forth the
missing secrets of magnetism, and instead of getting a gush of knowledge, I got a rapidly unfolding dam break as it were
of insights
into things both deep and so obvious that it erased a lifetime of bad programming and information I was fed (along with
everyone
else) on magnetism. Literally “working backwards”, retroduction is a lost ancient method of discovery so acutely helpful
its amazing
this art is lost completely to modernity, especially that it is so quick in its workings. While deduction and induction
sift thru the hay
stack for the needle, retroduction works backwards from what is known to the answer, for example knowing that a needle
is metal and
hay is flammable, set fire to the stack and in an instant all is gone completely leaving the needle glaringly obvious.
Kudos again to this
lost art of unfolding knowledge!

Your TV, cellphone, car, computer, hard drives, absolutely everything you touch or use every day is run off either a
permanent
magnet or magnetic fields or powered by them at their source; however there is not one person on this earth that knows
what a field is,
what magnetism is, what instant action at a distance is and what mediates it (since it is by particles). We use,
replicate, make, and
utilized magnets on every corner of the earth and yet all that is present are descriptions of the nature of magnetic
uses, but not a single
logical or rational explanation of what magnetism actually is. The world is long in descriptions, for which even a child
can
accomplish. True genius arrives where explanations begin and descriptions end. The ‘how’ and the ‘why’ have eluded
humanity on
magnetism for far too long. Most amazingly to myself and not to the other lemmings of the world is that magnets are
found in every
device we use, our cars, phones, televisions, hard drives, headphones, the list in utterly stunning and without end but
we are either free
not to care or too busy to bother to understand. We, as peoples reproduce magnets and use then in enormous quantities
but have no
idea what they are. Typical of humans, we learn how to use and reproduce something helpful we stumble across thru the
ages, but
could care less how it works, and what it really is.

From childhood to adulthood, magnets have fascinated man. Young children are given sets of magnets to play with, linking
them
end-to-end. School children are shown, with iron ore dust, just how those invisible magnetic lines reach and curl,
preparatory to a
lecture about the Earth's magnetic field and on to how to use the compass when lost in the woods. The use of magnets so
permeates
industrialized human society that one would be hard pressed to find an aspect not affected. Lock-free doors secure with
magnets, and
recyclers separate out metal with magnets, to name but a few. Yet man does not understand magnetism, though theories
abound. It's
clear that something flows, but just what is flowing is (was) unknown. It's clear that direction is important, but just
what is dictating
this direction is unclear. It's clear that magnetism occurs naturally, especially in certain ores such as loadstone
iron, but what it is that
is special about iron ore is a puzzle.
People today ignorantly assume and think you need a multi-million dollar lab to make groundbreaking discoveries. These
same
fools should be reminded that Tesla, who invented much of the modern world we live in, did not have a Radio Shack or
electronics
store to go get parts from. Tesla was working with raw steel, copper, wood and wire. He used his keen mind and deductive
mental
prowess and great reference materials such as Roger Joseph Boscovich’s “Theory of Natural Philosophy”. The same holds
true for
Faraday, Steinmetz and Edison. Sharp minds with razor-like deductive capacities solve great mysteries. We still today
use the works
of Newton who had only his brain, pen, paper and his writings from same. NASA uses these same scribblings to correct for
gravity in
guiding a satellite to land by remote control on Mars. Great discoveries come from greater minds, not from a particle
collider costing
many billions of dollars. Humanity may some day learn this lesson.
When the supposed ‘expert’ and Hollywood-scientist and academic fraud Richard Feynman was asked to explain what
magnetism
is, how it works, sitting in his chair, he twitched and squirmed like a frog on a hotplate, wiggling and dodging the
question, then
deflects, and finally says its too complex (for mere mortals) to understand. Eventually he concedes he cannot explain
these “forces”.
This rather infamous video of a worm on a hotplate can be found everywhere. Likewise, his book so highly praised by his
hubris filled
academic stooges, “QED strange theory of light and matter” explains magnetism away with angels and unicorns, or rather I
should
accurately say “virtual photons”, of which there is no quantitative difference between unicorns and the ‘sage’ academic
explanation of
“virtual photons”, both are patently absurd and offend even the common sense of a ten year old child and people
collectively.
This is all of course is against Feynman’s own proclamation that “if you can’t explain it to a six year old, then you
really don’t
understand it”. In this case, the absurdity of unreal particles and mythical abstractions might be enjoyed conceptually
by someone with
the mind of a six year old. All these mathematical reifications, sadly, fall in line with the unscientific and
irrational mythos of
mathematical physics (Greek Atomism in reality) of which one of its key proponents declares “when common sense fails (to
explain
things rationally), uncommon sense must be created” **_L. Susskind_**.

Nothing was more perturbing and aggravating than watching the demon Richard Feynman sitting in his chair twitching and
squirming and fidgeting like a frog on a frying pan when being asked very simplex and logical questions “how does
magnetism
work?”, “how does one magnet attract another, and what is the medium of this attraction?”. Finally after flopping like a
fish on dry
land for an enormous amount of time he states: “I cannot answer it in a manner in which you can understand it or that is
familiar to
you”. That idiots with degrees and acclaim are looked to like the Pope, a clueless fool put on a pedestal, is a timeless
human failing,
and can be forgiven. However when people assume they know what something is (if they care at all), they do not go
looking for the
answer to what they already assume they know.

That Feynman and others have declared (as he has done in his mystical book: QED strange theory of light and matter) that
magnetism is mediated by “virtual photons” is no different than the Pope declaring mother Marry as healing a sick child
from a
pendant worn at the neck. Humanity has placed, as dept. chairs in countless universities and likewise, heads of
mathematics and
physics, people who are quite literally insane, are deep thinkers, but insane ones. The insane asylums of the world are
full of genuinely
deep thinkers, however it is not for sake of deep thinking they are locked up and away from others! So, taking a cue
from Quantum
mysticism we then ask the expert (fool) relativist “since you declare magnetism to be mediated by ‘virtual photons’,
what is same?”.
**Answer received? Yes, here we have it:** “A virtual particle is an abstraction, which facilitates in calculations and
understanding, the
term is very vague and loosely defined, they never appear as inputs or outputs of experiments, their existence is
questionable at
best,...however they are very useful in rendering concepts and making equations balance out”. Well, insanity has been
reified, at last!
**Fields!** The 800-pound gorilla in the room of quantum mysticism is defining a field, action at a distance both
instant and in a
vacuum. Owning and pouring through every existing book on action at a distance, there is not one scientist alive or dead
who can tell
you what a field is without evoking Greek Atomism as an explanation, virtual particles, muons, gluons, gravitons,
negative
momentum particles and countless other things that do not exist, nor have ever even remotely been proven, and never will
be. Its
axiomatic, a truism that physics can only do experiments with objects, and irrationally considers only physical objects
as “existing”,
not in a conventional sense, but in an absolutist sense, therefore physics has no possibility (it never has!) of
explaining a field, be it
magnetic, dielectric, gravitational, since all fields are Ether-based. The obvious and glaring truth in observation and
fact is that fields
act instantly over a vacuum, and there are no particles of quantum mysticism mediating any field. Every aspect of energy
production
in the world is about moving pressures from one place to another, nuclear reactor to move steam pressure, wind pressure
for a
generator, dielectric pressures from light in solar cells; and yet the cult of quantum and GR refuse to acknowledge that
all
electromagnetic and gravitational motions, and energy production, or magnetic induction into copper in producing
electricity, that all
of these are merely Ether pressures. As Dollard has called it, a “mind virus”; it is a comprehensional lobotomy of
humanity and its
religion of GR and QM.
Physics is the science of existence, but not necessarily the science of truth, only of objective truth (which as any
rational person
knows is only half or less of the picture), which is not part nor parcel to any field which has no objective existence,
no objective
reality! The quickest way to hush anyone within the realm of GR or QM (general relativity and quantum mechanics) is to
ask him or
her what a “field” is, and immediately inform him or her before answering that it cannot involve particles, as this is a
well established
absolute. There have only been two positions in the totality of history on fields and magnetism, immaterial and
materialistic /
atomistic. The GR and QM position is purely materialistic, they have not one explanation for a field, they explain away
fields, in fact
no less, with another field, and their pseudo-argument is purely circular and fallacious; at best they evoke non-entity
particles to
rationalize fields as the means and mediators of fields, however of course this is impossible in the vacuum of space and
at the
superluminal speeds in which some fields operate. Typical of GR and QM insanity, fields and the Ether have been replaced
with an
insane reification of ‘warped spacetime’. While most historical immaterial explanations for fields have been
surrealistic, hyper-
mystical, magical, the fact remains that all fields are Ether in nature, they are also rational, logical and these are
the very same
conclusions drawn by Tesla, Steinmetz, Heaviside, and Maxwell (among many), and the only conclusions that explains
fields,
dielectricity, magnetism, gravity, electricity and countless other rational, logical experiments and observations
without end.
The notion that magnetism is a “quantum mechanical effect” is pure nonsense, additionally that there are ‘electrons
moving’ which
resultantly creates magnetism; this is absurd, contrary to facts and observation. As any ‘scientist’ will tell you,
nobody has ever ‘seen
an electron’, as discussed further on, this is the premise of the greatest minds of electrical theory as well, Tesla,
Heaviside, Maxwell,
Steinmetz and others. Typical of GR and QM, they have reified unreal abstractions and concepts (muons, gluons, electrons
etc.),
things that utterly do not exist, and thoroughly dismiss reality, that being fields and the Ether. Rationally one must
ask themselves that
since the greatest inventive minds to exist and which created our entire electrical world, Tesla, Maxwell, Steinmetz and
others, if these
great minds embrace the Ether as reality, and academic fools who invent nothing and only create fictional works
vociferously deny it,
which side is the more rational and sane?
When starting down this road some long time ago, I would have wished that magnetism was a unique force unto itself, a
principle
of its own, however that was not to be! Magnetism is radiation, is definitionally the “dielectric field”- Faraday (and
Maxwell).
Radiation does not “attract” radiation (the ever-held false view that magnets “attract” or “repel” each other due to
magnetism, is
wholly wrong). Polarization, space (resultant to a field), radiation, CW/CCW, divergence are all synonymous with what
magnetism is
definitionally. However while not ‘let down’ that magnetism was not a “unique principle”, just another modality of the
Ether (as are
all four forces are), a deep understanding dawned and with this came an enormous flowing discovery like a floodgate came
forth of
both invention, understanding, and the ability not to just to describe (which any fool can do), but to explain and
genuinely grasp all
which was occurring, the why, the how, etc. was all painted in perfect clarity.
_“This medium of propagation, the Ether must exist. This medium must be a prominent thought in our investigations”_ *
*_Treatise on
Electricity and Magnetism – J.C. Maxwell_**
The universe is simplex but not simple, there are no ‘zero sized particles’ mediating magnetism, or fantasies that only
exist in the
minds of GR and QM priests. Like a bar of steel which can be at various lengths creating various tones like a xylophone,
or circular,
or tubular, in motion, moving centripetally or centrifugally, all such phenomena, nearly endless, can be reproduced by
the size,
geometry, movements of what we started out with, a standard bar of iron. The universe is divinely simplex (but not
simple), with only
three components, the Ether, mass particles, and fields (all of which are Ether in principle, and the particles
themselves are stable
dielectric conglomerations and Ether-based). Everything else is tones, overtones, geometry, and movements, spatial and
counterspatial, centrifugal and centripetal. Ironically, the fools of quantum mysticism have created a pantheon of
irrational virtual
nonsense (gluons, muons, gravitons, electrons, quarks, virtual photons, zero-sized particles), and yet these same
academic fools accuse
the greatest minds who lived, Tesla, Edison, Steinmetz, Heaviside, Maxwell, and countless others who declare all is
impossible

“without the Ether”, to be the irrationalists! The facts are irreducible, the great minds of Tesla, Steinmetz and others
invented
everything upon which the modern world runs and loves dearly in daily use; likewise the pendants, the mystics of GR and
QM
produce only nonsense, pontifications, insane theories without a logical hypothesis to begin with and fantastical books
that make Alice
in Wonderland seem perfectly plausible by comparison. The mystics of GR and QM have so convincingly played their parts
in
producing “new particles” and other unreal objects (which have never been witnessed or appear as the outputs of
experiments) that
they have not realized in the slightest that all such names given are but reifications attributed to different states
and modalities of Ether
based pressure movements and likewise Ether field modalities (gravity, mass, magnetism, dielectricity).
**And I will explain to you the “Wheeler Principle” of magnets** , that being **point non-specific self-similarity** ;
the finally
explained incommensurability of the coherent magneto-dielectric system of a magnet, which lucidly and logically explains
how
magnets operate one and for all, with proofs, formulas, and irreproachable logic. The magnetic vortex and mutual field
reciprocation
does indeed exist in the so-called magnet (I will explain this further on).

_“Beware of false knowledge, its more dangerous than ignorance”_ **_-Shaw
Irrationality defined_** _: “an explanation that a proponent cannot imagine, explain, or illustrate”_

_“Mother Nature does not calculate, does not do math, she only knows of three pairs, spatial-counterspatial,
centrifugal-centripetal,
and charge-discharge. With these three conjugates, the entire cosmos is painted in full detail. Phi is to 1, as 1 is to
Phi, understand
this fact, or you will understand nothing.”_ **_– Author_**

_“If you were to reveal the dielectric inertial plane of a magnet with field viewing film to an ancient Platonist, or
ancient Egyptian
metaphysician, at which there is no magnetism present between the two “poles”, he would proclaim forthwith that this was
the
universal fulcrum sitting at the middle of all space, antinomies, and becoming. But a modern fool existentialist, an
Atomist calls this a
‘Bloch wall’, or domain wall. Descriptions and names are not explanations or understanding, or comprehension.
Dielectricity is the
fundamental Ether-modality of the entire cosmos.”_ **_- Author_**

_“If anyone, not knowing, were to ask why magnetism moves the way it does, the most simple and true answer would be that
‘it cannot
exist any other way’. Nature does not move against higher pressures or motions with a lower moving pressure unless the
lower
pressure accelerates all pressure voidances between the two or moves in a counter-operational spin and therefore does
not ‘exist’ on
the same plane as the higher pressure it moves against. The free space compressibility of the Ether is different than
the compressibility
of same as conjugated atomically in the dielectric and the magnetic bounding volumes. From this fact, all things
possible are seen.”_ **_–
Author_**

Hermetic tradition, suggest that knowledge of the magnet originated with the Magi, plural of magh, or magus, who were
the first to
discover its attraction as witnessed in loadstone iron. Consequently, the “magical” loadstones were named in their
honor. The word
magnet deriving from the Sanskrit root word, mahaji, (maha+jhayati) meaning the great or wise, but specifically meaning
“has magic”
(in ancient days wisdom was magic and vice versa). The Egyptians believed the sky to be made of iron or steel, namely,
obviously due
to iron meteorites; hence the name for iron, metal of heaven. Meteoritic iron, which was, early on, famous from
loadstones with their
“magical attraction”. The very same thing Muslims pray to every day is a broken up meteorite embedded into the kabbah in
Mecca;
yes, Muslims are bowing down in prayer to a broken up iron meteorite. The “magic stone from heaven”.
Once again as in other matters, and almost ironically, the ancient Greeks had a firmer grasp on the nature of magnetism
than does
the modern quantum mystic. From Plato we have: “Other examples are any stream of flowing water, the fall of
thunderbolts, and the
puzzling attraction of amber and loadstone.” **–Plato.** “In fact there is no attraction. Proper investigation shows
that there is no void and
that circular thrust operates in all these instances; the various bodies part or come together in the course of mutual
interchanges of
position and what seems like magic is due to the complication of their effects on each other.” **–Plato**. “Circular
thrusts”, even the
ancient Greeks knew about the circulatory nature of magnetism! Retroductive logic is so powerful that the Greeks (who
knows to what
great extent) knew what magnetism was vaguely (at least that it was field induction by mediation, which is not
materialistic), while
not in specific, they still understood this thousands of years ago.
“Really, as I said just now, this is no art in you to speak well about Homer; no, some divine power is moving you, such
as there is
in that stone which Euripides called the Magnesian, but most people call it the Heraclean stone. This magnet attracts
iron rings, and
not only that, but puts the same power into the iron rings, so that they can do the same as the stone does; they attract
other rings, so
that sometimes there is a whole long string of these rings hanging together, and all depend for their power on that one
stone. So the
Muse not only inspires people herself, but through these inspired ones others are inspired and dangle in a string.” **-(
Socrates on
magnets ION 535e).** From this we know that Socrates and who knows how much further back before him knew what magnetic
induction was. In using the analogy of magnetic induction to speak of the muses who can, at a distance by immaterial
(incommensurable!) means influence and move things to do action. “Thales, too, to judge from what is recorded about him,
seems to
have held the soul to be a motive force, since he said that the magnet has a soul in it because it moves the iron.” **(
Aristotle on the
Soul. De Anima, 405a).** Epicurus who writes the following explanation for the action of the magnet: “The lodestone or
magnet
attracts iron because the particles which are continually flowing from it, as from all bodies, have such a peculiar
fitness in form to
those which flow from iron that, upon collision, they easily unite.” **- Epicurus (342-270 B.C.)**

“Why the Heraclean stone attracts iron. Empedocles says that the iron is borne towards the stone by the effluvia
emanating from
both and because the pores of the stone are fitted to receive the effluvium of the iron. The effluvium of the stone then
expels the air
from the pores of the iron. Once the air is expelled, the iron itself is carried along by the abundant flow of the
effluvium. Again, when
the effluvium of the iron moves towards the pores of the stone, which are fitted to receive it, the iron begins to move
with it.” **-
Empedocles of Akragas (491-435B.C.).** This was from the second hand account of Alexander of Aphrodisias who paraphrases
Empedocles theory. As today, as was before, there are only two explanations for magnetism, one materialistic and
mechanical (as
above, evoking particles, nonsense, reifying space as a mediator), and the other immaterial, based in fields, the
Ether (Platonic and
Pythagorean in nature). This Atomistic / materialistic insanity contrasts with the Thalean theory, which attributes the
attraction to a
non-materialistic, hidden, and immaterial cause, or field mediator. As it was in ancient times so it is today, that
these two views
constitute the only two main positions used to construct theories of electricity and magnetism throughout the
“prescientific” and
“scientific” (irrational) eras. All the theories constructed since the days of the ancients can be classified as either
materialistic, based
on the action of ‘effluvia’ in the form of tiny insensible particles (same as the nonsense of GR and QM today, their
‘virtual photons’),
or as mediated by immaterial fields, and forces of attraction that act at a distance across the intervening space and
vacuum. Of course
only the later is correct, logical, sensible, and the position of all the great minds who invented most everything the
modern world
worships and uses on a daily basis.
Another ancient materialistic view of magnetism: “Democritus also says that there are effluences and that like bodies
are attracted
to like, but adds that all are attracted to a void. Having made these hypotheses, he supposes that the loadstone and
iron consist of
similar atoms, but those of stone are smaller and it is of some rarer texture than the iron and contains more void. For
this reason, its
atoms being more mobile are attracted more quickly to the iron (for they are moving to their similars), and entering the
pores of the
iron disturb the atoms in it as they pass between owing to their small size. The atoms of the iron, thus disturbed,
stream outside
towards the stone because of their similarity and because it has more void. The iron [as a whole] follows them in their
wholesale
expulsion and movement and is itself drawn towards the stone. the reason why the stone does not move any more towards
the iron is
that the iron does not contain so much void.” **– Democritus (according to Alexander of Aphrodisias who is the source on
this
quote)**
At one period in history, loadstones sold and traded for their weight in gold, and were used by traveling magicians to
impress the
common fool as to his ‘magic’ powers in creating or evoking magic rocks that could make iron fly from rest to these
‘magic stones’.

**Electron nonsense, dismissing the ‘discharge particle’ fallacy**

_“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration (not matter).” -_ *
*_N. Tesla_**

_The two greatest sins committed in so-called science in the past hundred years are convincing the ignorant many folk to
believe that:_

_1. Space and time are genuine entities rather than conceptions and attributal abstractions; and that they mediate
action at a distance
and are the medium or field itself. 2. The fantastical invention of virtual particles, and massless beads that mediate
gravity, light EM,
and magnetism. Such nonsense offends the mind of even a drunkard and a child. Concepts and non-existent particles have
no place in
the mechanics of the cosmos or of rational physics._

_“A deep thinker (GR and QM) who cannot see clearly takes a sonar image of the turbid waters of the sea floor, recording
its image,
then moments later takes another image and seeing new masses on the bottom from the sonar image declares such bumps
‘evidence of
sea-floor shifting, a possible newly forming volcano’. The clear thinker can see the remaining 99% between the surface
and the
bottom of the sea and informs the insane deep thinker that those bumps are whale shit.”_ **_- Author_**

_“If you cannot explain the laws of physics simply, to a bar maid, then you don’t really understand them yourself.”_ *

_“What Tesla accomplished is the greatest discovery in mankind. The transmission lines you see everywhere, along the
roads in every
place you go, these allows us to have a giant drive shaft that we can take rotary motion from like a massive turbine
plant and convey it
thru an electromagnetic structure that operates with reflected waves and time frames. This work just like a drive shaft,
it bounces back
and forth, twists, and rotates. But you can stand outside and look at those thick power lines that go down any public
street and in the
space between those lines, the energy there is the energy of a giant railroad locomotive moving at 95% of the speed of
light down the
space between those wires, and there is no evidence that anything at all is happening except that the wires are slightly
pushed apart
and warm._ **_So it’s a type of drive shaft that exists in another dimension_**_. Then you put the synchronous machine
on the other end (of
that power line) and you couple out of that (electrical) drive shaft like a transmission and you have rotary force
again. These things
(rotary Tesla generators) are no more than stamped iron in patterns. By making this special arch form and its influences
on the
formative forces in the Ether ...Tesla’s invention is the most powerful arch form the human race has ever conceived.”_ *

**_Nikola Tesla November 1928 interview:_**
_On the whole subject of matter, in fact, Dr. Tesla holds views that are startlingly original. He disagrees with the
accepted atomic
theory of matter,_ **_and does not believe in the existence of an “electron” as pictured by science._**
_“To account for its apparently small mass, science conceives of the electron as a hollow sphere, a sort of bubble, such
a bubble
could exist in a medium as a gas or liquid because its internal pressure is not altered by deformation. But if, as
supposed, the internal_

_pressure of an electron is due to the repulsion of electric masses, the slightest conceivable deformation must result
in the destruction
of the bubble! Just to mention another improbability...”_ **- Nikola Tesla**
_Article: “A Famous Prophet of Science Looks into the Future” (Popular Science Monthly)_

Electricity is utterly a mass-free phenomena, as mentioned by many including Dr. Wilhelm Reich in his “Cosmic
Superimposition”. Mass has no logical or theoretical place in electrical units and all particle-based conceptions of it
are impossible.
There is no mass in T.E.M. (transverse electromagnetism).
**Mother nature has never taken a course in math, algebra and she absolutely rejects the nonsense espoused by quantum.
‘She’ knows only about charge-discharge, spatial-counterspatial and centripetal-centrifugal spin as binary conjugates to
charges and discharges. Gravity, electromagnetism and matter are all modalities of the Ether, of charges and spin.**
There are
no negatively "charged" particles in this universe. Negative electricity discharges while positive electricity charges.
The negative
depolarizing force functions in the opposite manner and direction to the positive polarizing force. There is no such
condition in nature
as a negative charge, only discharges, nor are there negatively charged particles, further still not one iota of proof
for same. Charge
and discharge are antinomies, as filling and emptying, or compressing and expanding are mutual and co-eternal principle
conditions.
The commonly held belief in nonsense such as the notion that electricity is a stream of rolling electron beads thru a
conductor is one of
the most insane conceptual reifications of the definition of discharge as held by so-called intelligent minds.
There are no electrons, negative charges, special-dimensions, warped space (resoundingly denied by Tesla and others),
and no
photons; only charge, induction and radiation/discharges and their relational spins, all as mediated thru the Ether.
Quantum and
Relativity is a quack religion of mathematical physics based upon the absurd premise that the universe is a giant sea of
interactive
massless tiny invisible beads and that space itself, nothing, mediates interactions and can be genuinely ‘warped’. Such
conceptual
Atomistic reifications as amplified by GR (Relativity) cannot be enjoined, and the only genuine warping occurring is not
out in the
cosmos of space, but in the empty spaces between the ears of those who reify such absurdities; warped minds rationally
would invent
warped space; its purely logical in its insanity that the former produce the later.
Space has only one dimension, space, which is a metrical dimension. The use of cubic notation is habit-based, any number
of co-
ordinates in any number of geometries can serve to define the boundaries of space. **Nature is not governed by the
irrational
pontifications of GR and QM, rather it is governed by mutually interactive reciprocal conjugates of charges-discharges,
centripetal-centrifugal movements, both spatial and counterspatial. Instantaneous action at a distance, and fields are
all Ether
modality mediations as propagated by counterspace-in-disturbance, the Ether, its pressure gradients and perturbations.
No
other mediator can be logically hypothesized, much less theorized. The very same Ether of Tesla, Heaviside, C.P.
Steinmetz,
and even originally from Einstein before logic fled his mind completely, was correct and remains so. Tesla outright
denied our
current definition of the electron as a ‘discharge particle’.**
All electrons are a motional terminus of a quantity of dielectric pressure gradients of force (as reified by the
incorrect
understanding of the definition of a ‘field’), these pressure gradients, or “lines” are contracting and stretching like
rubber bands, giving
motion to the terminus ‘electron’. The thermionic ‘electron’ contracts, pulling the ‘electron’, the cathode ray
stretching, pulled by the
‘electron’. In the former case the lines of force are dissipated, in the latter case the line of force are projected, in
both cases these so-
called ‘electrons’ assume radial motions, with non participating pressure gradients, or forces filling the ‘voids’,
directing the
‘electrons’. Hence, it is the so-called ‘electrons’ (dielectric radial discharges) that travel in straight lines, that
is, radially. ‘ **Electrons’
have nothing to do with the flow of electricity; the so-called ‘electrons’ are the rate at which electricity is
destroyed.
‘Electrons’ are in fact the resistance. From e** xtensive experimental work into atomic electrical science by J. J.
Thompson, and
Nikola Tesla, it is established that the so-called electron is only a shadow; its apparent-only physical mass is merely
an electrical
momentum (ejected by the dielectric inertia in disturbance). There is no rest mass to an electron nor could there be
logically, a rest-
electron ‘bead’; such notions are absurd and evidence proven non-existent. The very premise is logically impossible and
contradicts
the rational physics of atomic charges and discharges.
“In the theoretical treatment of these electrons we are faced with the difficulty that electro-dynamic theory by itself
is unable to
give an account of their nature.” “For since electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be scattered
under the
influence of their mutual repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between them the nature of which
has hitherto
remained obscure to us.” **- Einstein on electrons; “Relativity”, by Albert Einstein, Random House Publisher, 1916**
There is no such condition in nature as a negatively charge particle nor could there be. Charge and discharges are
opposite
conditions of a single subject, either protons or fields of movements and radiation of those same electrical fields. To
claim that liquid
in a jar (charged) is one thing, and pouring that liquid from the jar (discharge) is another liquid altogether, is
nonsense, likewise
compression and expansion are opposite conditions of a single subject. Compressing bodies are charging into higher
potential
conditions. Conversely, expanding bodies are discharging into lower potential conditions.
“To describe an electron as a negatively charged body is equivalent to saying that it is an expanding-contracting
particle. There is
no such condition in nature as a negative charge, nor are there negatively charged particles. Charge and discharge are
opposite
conditions, as filling and emptying, or compressing and expanding are opposite conditions.” **– W. Russell**
Thomson developed the “Ether Atom” ideas of M. Faraday into his “Electronic Corpuscle”, this indivisible unit. One
corpuscle
terminates on one Faradic tube of force, and this quantifies as one Coulomb. This corpuscle is not and electron, it is a
constituent of
what today is known incorrectly as an “electron”. (Thomson relates 1000 corpuscles per electron) In this view, that
taken by W.
Crookes, J.J. Thomson, and N. Tesla, the cathode ray is not electrons, but in actuality corpuscles of the Ether.” **– E.
Dollard**
With the introduction of the so-called ‘electron’ by Thomson and the supposed debunking of the Ether theory **, the
golden age of
electrical discovery ended**. Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower was demolished. His work and that of other Ether researchers
fell into
disrepute. They were relentlessly attacked by mainstream science, something that continues to this day. As a result, the
days of Ether-
driven, electrical discovery petered-out, finally ending around 1930. As a direct and intentional result of the academic
physics theory,
the methodology behind the brilliant inventiveness of previous generations was all but wiped out and replaced by an
unproductive
particle physics. This, from the cult of quantum, a fraudulent collusion and academic hubris-based pseudo-conspiracy
based in “deep
thinking insanity” designed by mathematical physics.
I must give exclusions to quoting Walter Russell in any length and frame him properly, lest there is a misunderstanding
as I have
noticed from prior editions of this work and its reaction from Russell cultists, while he was roughly 75% accurate in
his positions, his
25% or so of inaccuracy is stunningly demented, namely his rejection of the Ether and his incapacity to differentiate
electricity from
dielectricity among many intellectual conclusions and failure Russell committed; dropping out of school at the age of
9 (essentially
utterly no education whatsoever) did him harm ultimately. His dogmatic cult-like followers have deified Russell to a
personality-cult
figurehead and they are rather an insane and rabid lot of moonbats. As an ancient philosopher once said “I will give him
great praise
for his accuracies, but I will not do so on his failures.” Blind dogmatic “all or nothing” devotion to the ‘deified
dead’ as regards
Russell or anyone is the realm of cultish maneuvers which cannot be intelligent or logically supported. Such rabid
insanity can be seen
of followers of Russell, Einstein, Feynman and a few others. The difference being of course that Russell was roughly 80%
correct,
whereas Einstein and Feynman were 80% wrong.
Stunningly important is the fact that **Walter Russell never and at no time defines, or attempts to even broach the
topic of what
a FIELD is.** Having digitized his works and making quick work of a word search of ‘FIELD’ will reveal absolutely
nothing
whatsoever in his three main works. As I have taught many people, you can tell more about what someone doesn’t say than
what they
do say. Absence is as strong or stronger than presence. Any incapacity to define the term FIELD an utter incompetence
and abysmal
failure of the absolute highest magnitude. Everything is fields, absolutely everything; as such an absolute failure to
broach the topic is
a monumental failure that must be pointed out. However he is far from alone in this titanic omission. While there are a
handful of
occurances of Russell’s in which he mentions ‘wave-fields’, this is utterly meaningless and left unqualified. Waves of
what, fields of
what? Waves are phenomena of prior subjects or principles, are merely qualifiers and not explicative of anything in
definition. We
seek answers here, not pathetic descriptions and pontifications.

The waveform of supposed “electron” flow is the same waveform produced when you slam on the brakes. It’s a harmonic sine
wave and the sound of energy dissipation. Electricity flows in the space between the wires. This has always been known
by electrical
engineers. For example, if you short out a major electrical circuit you will see the cables violently repel each other
as the
electromagnetic force tries to escape from the boundaries in which they are contained between the so-called bounding
conductors. The
power is between the conductive wires, not in them, nor are there electrons ‘beads’ bumping or flowing thru the
‘conductor’.
In general, the electrostatic potential, e, in Volt, renders the insulators hot, the magnetomotive force, i, in Ampere,
renders the
wires hot. Also, it is found that this heating increases with increasing frequency of the potential, e, or the M.M.F.,
i. It is here where
the prevailing concept of the "electron" is to be found. Hence it is the motions of the so-called electrons that give
rise to the energy
loss in an electrical system. “Electrons” represent energy dissipation. However, the cult of quantum, and the ill
informed fool all tell
us that the ‘electron’ is a subatomic particle and charge carrier, and is that which conveys energy, this is complete
irrational nonsense!
“Maxwell’s discovery of a factor of proportionality between dielectricity and magnetism led to his theory of conjugate
pair of
inductions, dielectric and magnetic, in union, propagating at the velocity of light through the ‘Luminiferous Ether’.
Hence, electro-
magnetic waves in free space, unbounded by gross physical matter, mass free energy. This propagation is within the
dielectric, or
Etheric, medium itself. It is free of so-called “charge carriers” (electrons), a mass-less form of electricity. This
concept had a very
powerful impact upon the scientific and philosophical thoughts of Maxwell’s era. So here begins the notion of
“wireless”, the
transmission of electricity without wires or other guiding structures.” **– E. Dollard**
“There is no rest mass to an ‘electron’. It is given here the ‘electron’ is no more than a broken loose “hold fast”
under the grip of
the tensions within the dielectric lines of force. They are the broken ends of the split in half package of spaghetti.
Obviously this
reasoning is not welcome in the realm of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.” **– E. Dollard**
“This gaseous Ether is the seat of electrical phenomena through the process of its polarization. This polarization gives
rise to
induction, which then gives rise to stored energy. Tesla gives a good presentation of his Ether ideas in his
“Experiments with Alternate
Currents of High Potential and High Frequency.” Mentioned previously, the Planck, Q, as the primary dimensional relation
defining
the “Polarized Ether”, this as an “Atom of Electricity”. It is however, from the views of J.J. Thomson, the Coulomb,
psi, the total
dielectric induction is the primary dimension defining the “Polarized Ether”. The lawyer like skill of today’s
theoretical physicist
(Pharisee) has erased this understanding from human memory, it is henceforth sealed by the Mystic Idol of Albert
Einstein. If Einstein
says no, then it is impossible. What a nice little package.” **– E. Dollard**
“Unfortunately to a large extent in dealing with dielectric fields the prehistoric conception of the electro-static
charge, the
‘electron’, on the conductor still exists, and by its use destroys the analogy between the two components of the
electric field, the
magnetic and dielectric. This makes the consideration of dielectric fields unnecessarily complicated” **- C.P.
Steinmetz (Electric
Discharges, Waves and Impulses)**
The idea of electricity as a flow of ‘electrons’ in a conductor was regarded by **Oliver Heaviside** as **“a psychosis”.
** This encouraged
Heaviside to begin a series of writings
_“Electrons as a separate, distinct entity...doesn’t really exist, they are merely bumps in something called a
‘field’.”_ - **Dr. Steve
Biller**
“Here we will dispel the "electronics nerd" concept that a capacitor stores "electrons" in its plates. Taking the pair
of copper plates
as in the previous experiment, but now we have two pairs of plates, one pair of plates distant from the other pair of
plates. Upon one
pair of plates is imposed an electro-static potential between them. The cube of 10-C oil is inserted between this "
charged" set of plates.
This hereby establishes a dielectric field of induction within the unit cube of 10-C oil. Now we then remove this cube
of oil,
withdrawing it from the space bounded by the charged pair of copper plates, and taking this unit cube of oil, it is then
inserted into the
space bounded by the other uncharged pair of plates. Upon insertion it is found that the un-charged pair of plates have
now in fact
become charged also. It here can be seen that a cube of dielectric induction can be carried through space, from one set
of plates to
another set of plates.” **– E. Dollard**
Also consider the **J.J. Thomson** concept of the "electron" (his own discovery). Thomson considered the electron the
terminal end
of one unit line of dielectric induction.
“The notion exists that the electro-motive force, E.M.F. in volts, is established by “cutting” lines of magnetic
induction via a so-
called electric conductor. This “cutting” is then said to impel the motions of so-called electrons within the conducting
material. It is
however that a perfect conductor cannot “cut” through lines of induction, or flux lines, Phi. Heaviside points out that
the perfect
conductor is a perfect obstructer and magnetic induction cannot gain entry into the so-called conducting material. So
where is the
current, how then does an E.M.F. come about? Now enters the complication; it can be inferred that an electrical
generator that is
wound with a perfect conducting material cannot produce an E.M.F. No lines of flux can be cut and the Ether gets wound
up in a knot.
Heaviside remarks that the practitioners of his day “do a good deal of churning up the Ether in their dynamos”. **– E.
Dollard**
You cannot say that stretching a trillion rubber bands nailed to the floor and releasing them or breaking their “force
lines” is the
“flow of electrons”; discharge is a terminal movement in systems of inductance or dielectric capacitance. There are no
discrete
particles in the universe and certainly none that mediate charges, discharges, magnetism, electromagnetism, gravity, and
radiation,
only fields, all modalities of the Ether. The so-called ‘electrons’ are not particles, not objects or subjects but are
the dynamic principle
of discharge, and are certainly not charge-carriers, fields are not particles, are not “electrons”, nor assuredly are
there energy
discharges in the vacuum of space involving ‘electrons’; the ‘electron’ is a fiction of fallacious observation and an
even more faulty
mental acuity, spawned naturally from the minds of materialists, or an Atomist. Electricity is Ether in a state of
dynamic polarization;
magnetism is Ether in a state of dynamic circular polarization upon itself, is the radiative termination of electrical
discharge;
dielectricity is the Ether under stress or strain. The motions and strains of the Ether give rise to electrification.
Phi times Psi gives Q;
‘electrons’ do not mediate these electrical and magnetic forces or their likewise the Ether fields.
Microwave beaming of massive amounts of power to a satellite and back to earth is feasible and being looked into by the
military,
this is the transmission of mass-free dielectricity in the form of dielectro-electromagnetism (TEM), incorrectly deemed
“electromagnetism”. Waveform beaming between dipoles, laser induction energy transfer, all mass-free. Solar cells in
space, the
possibilities of wireless mass-free energy transfer are nearly endless. Inductions and fields mediate charges and
discharges, not
particles!
In this technology (below) two coils are placed at a distance. Current is passed through one coil and a magnetic field
is generated.
Now, if the second coil is present within the magnetic field of the first coil a magnetic field will be generated in the
second coil too. If
however the second coil is outside the range of the first coil no magnetic field will be produced and so no power will
be transmitted.
This method is used to charge electric toothbrushes.

**The ‘electron microscope’ lie**

_There are no negatively "charged" particles in this universe. Negative electricity discharges while positive
electricity charges. The
negative depolarizing force functions in the opposite manner and direction to the positive polarizing force._ *
*_– W. Russell_**

_“Always question the academic who tells you he’s manipulating particles that nobody has never witnessed. Countless
particles are
created in the Atomistic religion of quantum as demonstrable redesignations of electrical and magnetic effects and
fields. An entire
academic pantheon of liars is established to perpetrate this nonsense.”_ **_– Author_**

"Because the SEM (scanning electron microscope) utilizes vacuum conditions and uses ‘electrons’ to form an image,
special
preparations must be applied to the sample. All water must be removed from the samples because the water would vaporize
in the
vacuum. All metals are conductive and require no preparation before being used. All non-metals need to be made
conductive by
covering the sample with a thin layer of conductive material. This is done by using a device called a "sputter coater”.
The sputter
coater uses an electric field and argon gas. The sample is placed in a small chamber that is at a vacuum. Argon gas and
an electric field
cause an ‘electron’ to be removed from the argon, making the atoms positively charged. The argon ions then become
attracted to a
negatively charged gold foil. The argon ions knock gold atoms from the surface of the gold foil. These gold atoms fall
and settle onto
the surface of the sample producing a thin gold coating ”
Only conductive (metal) samples are suitable for “electron” microscopy untreated, all other samples are metal treated to
prevent
them from burning up in the intense dielectric beam. The resulting image is therefore of the metal coating or stain and
not the original
sample! Never believe a relativist telling you he’s “shooting his electron gun”. A metal dielectric reflector of a once
living organism is
not the original sample nor are there electrons scanning it. This device in reality is a dielectric scanning reflector,
which produces fine
images as only reflected off metal surfaces. The very focusing beams of these microscope are constrictor “lenses” of
dielectric flux
lines.

**Where is your magnet’s polarity, and which side is which? The easy way**

_Spacetime is the conjugate hybrid interaction of Magnetism and Dielectricity and their mutual transformation into
Electric Power and
Energy. Frequency gives rise to energy, this in Plancks per second._

This still causes people confusion, for somewhat obvious reasons. See pictures below for details. The quickest way to
determine
which pole of your magnet, without any field finders or compasses (if you don’t have one), is to place the magnet on a
smooth glass
plate, a diner plate if you wish, add a bit of oil, olive oil, etc. to the plate to reduce any friction, and then lay
the magnet on its side
with its poles parallel to the ground. If you know the geographic north relative to where you are, whichever direction
that is, you must
know this fact at least; proceed to gently shake the plate (not up and down!) parallel to the ground, and the magnet
will turn its north
pole to the geographic north pole of the earth. There you have it, now you have determined your N pole on your magnet (
and of course
its South pole).

**1. The actual north pole of the magnet is defined as the north-GEOGRAPHIC seeking pole, and this is because that is
where
the Earth’s magnetic SOUTH pole is.

2. The actual south pole of the magnet is defined as the south-GEOGRAPHIC seeking pole, and this is because that is
   where
   the Earth’s magnetic NORTH pole is.
3. The earth’s magnetic NORTH POLE is in the south (geographically), and the earth’s magnetic SOUTH POLE is in the
   north (geographically)**

**Below: On left as you can see, our compass has its south pointer at the north pole of the magnet, however our field
finder,
which correct showing “opposites attracting” should be painted in reverse. One could easily get the magnetic polarity
wrong
by using one of these field finders since the south of the finder is “pointing at this end, therefore that is the south
pole”. Which
would be wrong, it would be the inverse. Such field finders should all be painted opposite so as to avoid confusion. On
right we
see that (currently!) the Earth’s magnetic north pole is in the geographic southern location.**

**Ferrofluid**

_Unlike magnetism the energy is forced or compressed inwards rather than outwards. Dielectric lines of force push inward
into
internal space and along axis, rather than pushed outward broadside to axis as in the magnetic field._ *
*_Because the lines are mutually
repellent_** _certain amounts of broadside or transverse motion can be expected but the phenomena is basically
longitudinal. This gives
rise to an interesting paradox that will be noticed with capacity. This is that the smaller the space bounded by the
conducting
structure the more energy that can be stored. This is the exact opposite of magnetism._ **– Eric P. Dollard**

_Dielectricity is the Ether under torsion and torque at its inertial plane; magnetism is a spatial circular
reciprocating vortex, an
Etheric ‘pair’ of fountains and countersinks. Electricity is the dynamic radial or reciprocating polarization of the
Ether._

The reason ferrofluid forms cone shaped spikes along any pole is that the raised apexes are the alternating centripetal
and centrifugal
points of preponderance which raise themselves not as lines but as cones. Nothing in nature moves in lines, rather in
spirals. To raise
any single portion of the ferrofluid is to create inter-atomic magnetic dilation in the ferrofluid, which approaches in
a cone-first vortex,
as any plane of centrifugal acceleration is cone-base first, whereas any vortex plane of expulsion from the magnet is
apex first.

**BELOW: One of my own inventions of a ferrofluid suspension on the left with wholly unique properties and interesting
attributes. On right is conventional ferrofluid suspension as found immersed in sugar-saturated (or other) water.**

As is the case, any centrifugal vortex is cone-acceleration as highest and any centripetal vortex is apex acceleration
as highest.
Pressure increases in inverse proportions to the field. As is likewise the case with all fields, the greater the
pressure the closer the
spatial proximity to field voidance. This concept of the Ether is extremely hard for people to understand. Just as at
the center of any
magnet, the dielectric inertial plane, there is no magnetism, likewise if one were able to occupy a space at the center
of the Earth there
would be no gravity, likewise at the axle of any field disturbance there is neither a field no acceleration.
Polarization, and acceleration
exist radially from the apex of magnetic field, but inversely accelerate towards the apex centripetally, however
regardless of
centrifugal or centripetal movement, at the center between both there is neither a field nor acceleration, this is the
membrane of all
fields in counterspace; in the case of the magnet, this membrane is ‘open’, and is the dielectric inertial plane.

**BELOW: One of my own inventions of a ferrofluid suspension, which give a 25+ second window on the magnetic vortex.
Close
inspection (now scaled up from this test tube demo) shows a double helical vortex just like a waterspout pictured in the
middle.**

The apex is always pointing towards the direction of the magnetic flow vortex centrifugally and inversely so
centripetally upon
intermediate proximity with the ferrofluid (opposite of this in the magnet itself). However since there are two vortexes
spiraling in

opposite directions and thru each other, greater forethought is required for accurate visualization. Ferrofluid is
magneto-attractive
regardless of spin or centripetal or centrifugal movements.

**BELOW: Left is a special formulation of ferrofluid immersion, which shows the centripetal vortex of the magnet below
it. On
the right is standard ferrofluid as explained for the first time ever here.**

At the magnetic polar-surface, the ferrofluid apex is always pointing towards the decelerating end of either flow of
magnetic vortexes,
which is why both centripetal and centrifugal apex points are pointing away from the magnet. High accelerations exist at
the surface-
mass returning (centripetal) and high accelerations exist at the surface-mass leaving (centrifugal) define both
centripetal and
centrifugal vortexes.

Centripetal magnetic vortexes accelerate approaching the surface (and deeper) and centrifugal vortexes likewise
decelerate from the
surface which is their point of maximum velocity.

**BELOW: Typical ferrofluid resting against the dielectric inertial plane of a very large 6” by 2” neodymium “magnet”.
This
position causes divergence of the nano-iron particles away from the dielectric dominant inertial plane which is only
attractive
to itself in dominance.**

The reason ferrofluid forms larger cone shaped spikes further from the polarized surfaces is due to the Ether field
lines of magnetic
divergence undergoing rapid deceleration away from the geometric plane of both convergent and divergent polarized
fields. These
spikes can be seen regardless of gravity and are not due to fluidic surface tensions of the ferrofluid. The CW and CCW
spin vortexes
weave thru the ferrofluid creating a field of evenly shapes cones. Small cones indicates high acceleration and large
cones indicates
increasing deceleration. As is necessitated magnetic strength and velocity (one and the same) can be determined by
conical volumes
over distance.

**BELOW: Ferrofluid spikes, understood correctly here as following golden ratio spirals and the golden angle of 137.5077
degrees**

Using a circular container with a small amount of ferrofluid it will be observed that a magnet approaching the
ferrofluid will throw the
ferrofluid to the outer perimeter of the beaker as if centrifugally dispersed, which is due to the centrifugal expulsion
of either outer
edges of a magnet which is carrying the ferrofluid in the same centrifugal direction.

Using a circular container with a small amount of ferrofluid it will be observed that a magnet approaching the
ferrofluid will throw the
ferrofluid to the outer perimeter and likewise create in the very center, at a specific point in approach, a large spike
in the center which
juts out abruptly like a tongue being poked out of a ringed mouth of outwardly thrown ferrofluid. However upon
approaching closer
this center spike will split in two, then three and four forming a negative sink ‘void’ where the highly accelerated
returning centripetal
vortex is entering at the very center of the magnetic face.

**Below: One of my ferrofluid inventions/ suspensions with one of the poles above causing dielectric coherency in the
ferrous
particles and resultant acceleration to the pole-face. This is dielectric induction coherency. What is reaching out
across space
(of a field) is obviously magnetism, however magnetism is the cause of the acceleration, rather inductive polarization
by means
of dielectric coherency.**

**Below: One of my ferrofluid inventions/ suspensions with the poles laying flat left to right, exposing the dielectric
inertial plane
to the ferrofluid in my special suspension. Notice that polarization exists in the ferrofluid by induction of either or
both poles
of the “magnet” and the ferrofluid will accelerate to either pole but not along the dielectric inertial plane. There is
no such
thing as magnetic attraction; induced iron, or a steel ball will not approach the dielectric inertial plane at close
approach since
the induced iron, or ferrofluid is magnetically dominant. Magnetism and dielectricity are mutually repellant. All
induced
objects are magnetically induced and have no increase in dielectric capacitance, only dielectric coherency, likewise
they a
smaller dielectric footprint than normal.**

With much experimentation I was able to create a blend of suspended ferrofluid that would bead rather than clump and
demonstrated
the center impelling centripetal vortex at the center of any magnet (see picture above).

**Below: Left, a centripetal vortex with max spin at its apex (point), as one would see in a pulled drainage plug or a
tornado.
Right, a centrifugal vortex, where max spin is at the top, or cone of the vortex. This is a magnetic stirrer being
stirred by a
magnet. This is the first phase of magnetic expulsion, where the magnet in this stirrer plays the analogy of the
dielectric
inertial plane ‘throwing out’ magnetism along the beaker inner-wall, or magnet-mass-wall, at which, given MORE velocity,
the ‘water’ or Ether of the magnetism will be flung out along the top edge of the beaker exactly like in the example of
a
standard magnet. A centrifugal vortex starts out slow then accelerates towards its cone. A centripetal vortex starts out
slow at
its cone and accelerates towards its apex. A type of example of a centrifugal ‘vortex’ would be cracking a whip where a
minor
speed hand motion translates into the end of a whip going so fast as to break the sound barrier.**

**_Regarding magnetic viewing film_**
At the pole, there is a bright spot in the center because of the centripetal returning magnetic vortex

This film is much more greatly influenced by field velocity than does it accurately show the field, in which case iron
filings, in their
weak and inaccurate ability to show the field, demonstrate this better than does magnetic viewing film.

**Below: Magnetic viewing film left without the film, right, behind the film (red outlines the magnet edge). This shows
the high-
speed dielectric inertial plane of all magnets. This type of film doesn’t show magnetic fields much at all, rather it
only reacts to
strong field velocities, namely at the inertial plane and along the centrifugal polarized edges of both sides of the
magnet where
velocity is very high.**

**This is not the model of magnetism. The iron filings grand error**

_“This whole time, humanity has been looking at and fascinated with the wrong sides of the magnet.”_ **_– Author_**

_“Let me be bold and blunt: there is absolutely no such thing as ‘magnetic attraction’ or magnetism-powered ‘ferrous
acceleration’ to
a so-called ‘magnet’._ **_It does not exist, nor is there one iota of any validation for this age-old insane premise_**
_. Both so-called
acceleration and repulsion are drive by dielectric voidance or counter-voidance (spatial barrier). Not only is there
absolutely no such
thing as magnetic attraction, I will present you with enormous evidence to the contrary, that ‘magnets’ are wholly
powered by
coherent dielectrics, with resultant magnetic radiation in discharge as necessitated byproduct. Radiation never attracts
anything, only
displaces and is the conjugate to dielectricity at the inter-atomic level.”_ **_-Author_**

The reason iron dust doesn’t give an accurate model of a magnetic field is that the iron filings are deep ‘in the water’
of the
breaking waves of the magnetic field, as such they show the direction of the magnetic flow, but not its spiral, its
vortex nature, which
hydrogen bubbles and pyrolytic graphite (and other mediums) can and do show, since they ‘ride the topmost part of the
waves’ of the
vortex magnetic flow. Logically so the iron filings cannot vortex since they themselves become miniature magnets by
being
magnetically induced, and are locked in place by becoming themselves polarized. Logically but counter intuitively on the
surface, any
3D models of magnetism using iron filings are in fact 2D false representations that cannot demonstrate magnetic field
architecture
The entire time we have been using iron filings to model the field architecture of magnets has been completely wrong.
You cannot
model field architecture by any substance that can be magnetized. Doing so creates thousands of tiny dust sized magnets
themselves
locked into the 2D pressures of the magnetic field geometry, as such this is no indication whatsoever as to the
3D-spatial-
counterspatial magnetic vortex architecture of a magnet or magnetism itself. In which case diamagnetic materials must be
used. Field
displacement gradients with ferrous ‘field demonstrators’ show polarized direction, but does not show
3D-spatial-counterspatial field
architectures. Superficially one may consider that suspending a magnet in the air and throwing iron filings at the
magnet will,
empirically produce a genuine 3D model of magnetism, as many people have seen demonstrated, however the field geometries
of
magnetism necessitates that to actually see magnetic field flow, that any material that can be magnetized itself, cannot
demonstrate
magnetisms’ 3D-spatial-counterspatial nature, nor can it demonstrate its flow at all.
A diamagnetic material that acts within time and not frozen in a spatial vector is required to witness the true nature
of magnetisms’
field architecture. The fact that a field is a non-local attribution not autonomous from the object to which it
encapsulates makes it hard
for the linear minds of people to conceive of a necessary diamagnetic material to witness a spatial counterspatial field
reciprocating
spirally and in pressure gradients which has no phenomenal quantity. A snapshot of a tornado is just a hyperbola of wind
with
phenomena acting oddly outside of this hyperbola. This is the nature and error of using iron dust to model magnetic
fields; it is
extremely inaccurate at best.

**Below: Iron dust models of 2D false “magnetic fields” used by all colleges, textbooks, training tools. These types of
field models
are critically inaccurate to demonstrate the true model of a magnetic field.**

certain laws; but
whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.”_ *

Before embarking on explaining magnetism, first the all important word field must be rigorously and scientifically
defined with
ambiguity and misconceptions fully removed. A field (Greek: χώρα) is a conjugate nonspatial attribute between the
subject, Ether, and
the object causing the perturbation (or EM induction), either as gravity, electricity, magnetism, or electromagnetism. A
field has
relevance only as a relational perturbation between the subject and the object causing its appearance; a field is
specified only as
regards to: electricity, magnetism, gravity, matter, and dielectricity (and another unmentioned for another article);
however as it must
be necessitated electricity, dielectricity, gravity, and magnetism are by their very principle not different from the
Ether itself. The very
term ‘magnet’ merely denotes the electrified mass formerly ‘not-a-magnet’; as such magnetism and magnet are abstractions
or
distinctions without a difference except as relates to the coherent field charges of the before and after mass.
Conceptual
disambiguation between a magnet and magnetism itself cannot be enjoined, and is merely a fallacious reification of
connotative
abstractions.
A field as purely an attribute (coordinate to X, or as induced by X) is meant as appearing in time but not in space (
otherwise we
cannot mark it, even if same is not in time) relationally to the object or that which caused the induction of which the
field is a dynamic
byproduct thereof; ultimately a field is always the subject (but in ignorance inversely seen as the attribute of
another), though
appearing posterior to the object which induced it to appear. As stated, there is no Ether in space, only space within
the Ether (when
polarized obviously), consubstantial reification choate of a field to and with space is a fallacy, when there is the
appearance of one “in

space” is as meant there is “space at the appearance of a field”, and incorrectly projected in error as ‘between fields’
additionally. A
field, being nonspatial and atemporal (however its affects are both co-principles of any phenomena involving or the
byproduct of a
field) cannot be ‘after’ anymore than it can be ‘before’ the object of consubstantial reference, which induced it to
appear. Just like the
field beneath ones feet, the field is before and after, distinctions only being made marking a field when induction is
or having had
occurred. However unlike the spatial field beneath ones feet which is dimensional, the Ether field is counterspatial and
is not, as
against the idiocy of GR, conjugate TO, OF, or AS space-time’s conceptual displacement abstractions and fallacious
Atomistic
reifications of space as a ‘thing’ in place of the Ether which mediates action at a distance, which is impossible.
A ‘field’ is the conceptual and mediated abstraction wrongly reified as an autonomous entity when in fact all fields are
as relates to
and of the Ether and an object that induces its appearance of which that object is necessarily of course comprised of
stable dielectric
Ether fields (matter), by logical necessity. A field is strictly a relational attribute and perturbation so noted when
induced to appear by
an object, by the movement of an object, or abstractly in reference to electromagnetism which is merely a lexical nuance
of referring
to the Ether itself. To reify a field in itself and in standalone cannot be scientifically enjoined; but for the sake of
electromagnetism,
the field or Ether are all one and the very same thing in denotation, a pure massless induction, circular, radial,
polarized, centripetal or
centrifugal, however the induction that led to the creation of electromagnetism (with its dielectric coaxial component)
must be
introduced as is necessarily the case. It must always be asked “a field OF what (as induced) BY what”. The field, the
medium (Tesla’s
“supreme medium”), or Ether occupies space as a gradient when induced, but cannot be space itself, nor can a field be
comprised of
points or lines as commonly understood a “magnetic field”, since magnetism is a pressure gradient of the Ether which
dismisses the
need for points or lines, since there are none involving same. In nature, there are no such entities as points or lines,
only pressures; one
must draw a line to make a point, therefore it is not a point, but a termination of a line, and one cannot make a line,
since one must
begin at a point (which is yet another line) to draw a line, therefore it is not a line but the (charging) expansion of
a point. This
additionally and summarily dismisses atomistic point particles; all fields and natures pressures are waves and
gradients, spatial and
counterspatial, radial or circular, there are no exceptions to this in the charging discharging universe of Ether
modalities.
In speaking of or about a field the only conventional distinction made between what is everpresent and the localized
field is in
speaking conceptually about a field-feature appearing in the featureless nonspatial and atemporal background whose locus
is
simultaneously everywhere and nowhere. This nonlinear subject without a locus, as pertains the Ether, or its abstraction
as ‘field’ is
the difficulty of linear minds to understand, grasp, express, and wrongly reify a field as a particle-mediated concept
or, as GR has
ignorantly done, transfer mediation to unreal attributive abstractions such as space and time, or as spacetime. In doing
so, the
connotative ramifications of the background fabric of the Ether has been circumvented and transferred to an irrational
reification of
space and time which cannot mediate either charges, magnetism, gravity, or instantaneous action at a distance. Fields
operate thru the
space within them via pressures, motions and time with no “concern” for same. Space operates on nothing, however it is
reified in
fields, but only when fields are polarized, and therefore have dimensional vectors which are measured in time and space;
but again
space does nothing, acts on nothing, mediates nothing, even the Greek Platonists and Pythagoreans knew this ages ago.
Like the fields or lands one stands upon, the field’s potential is ever present but unknown until there is a
perturbation, induction, or
disturbance in which case the field is readily manifest as pertains its conditional manifestations as phenomena or
actions upon other
masses. Space is not a field and fails the scientific definition of either subject or object. In the case of the field
analogy the Ether can
manifest a sinkhole, a hill, or a striation, respectively centripetal gravity (’sink’), induced electricity (‘uphill’/
generative) or
magnetism (‘downhill’ /radiative) around or of an object, or dielectro-electromagnetism itself in waveforms (
‘striations’). Gravity
itself is, unlike T.E.M. a “positive terminal” circular centripetal-emanative field with a negative Ether-pressure (true
vacuum) gradient
whose “negative terminal” is in counterspace (Ether). No field can terminate in space, including a gravity field.
Magnetic and electric fields are one in the same thing. In fact, there are no such things as “electrical fields” vs.
“magnetic fields”
vs. “gravity fields”; they are all just preturbative pressure modalities of the Ether. Likewise, there are no
“electrically charged”
discharge-particles: only permanent and equalized stable pressures of motion in the Ether; there is nothing outside the
Ether, only that
which is not inducing the Ether to the macro-world of observable phenomena (of which all phenomena are either Ether
based or
impelled by Ether gradients). There is no magnetism IN or OF a mass so deemed a ‘magnet’ as implied a field in same,
rather what is
coincidentally made to appear of/as space (not in space) as the medium to the spatial magnetic mass. There are
micro-magnetic forces,
obviously so, within all matter, electrified in the creation of a magnet or not, however this is not to what we are
directing the article
here regarding, yet.
A field must be purely a dynamic concept with either its terminus upon an object of gravity or magnetism or upon itself
as in the
case of radiated T.E.M., as implied the Ether to which field and Ether are synonymous, either way a field of any type
never terminates
in space, nor could it, there is space in the Ether field, but no Ether in space, likewise Ether logically therefore
cannot terminate in
space, as Maxwell, Tesla and others understood well. While the modalities of interaction and nature between magnetism,
gravity and
electromagnetism are apparently (superficially so) different, all are quantitatively fields by definition and Ether in
subject, or principle
without exception. Field is a conjugate definition of the Ether regarding 1. Dielectricity 2. Magnetism 3. Gravity 4.
Electromagnetic
and a fifth one to be named in another work, all five of which are modalities of dynamic Ether motions and pressures;
reductively
however all are merely nuanced distinctions of the Ether as incorrectly rationalized as different due to waves,
geometry, and motions
either centripetally, circularly or centrifugally of space. Since the many modalities of fields exist radially,
circulator, spatially,
counterspatially, centrifugally, and centripetally; herein lies the conceptual nuance in differentiating modalities of
the same subject in
a field, as relates to and of the Ether itself.
Since a field is always as pertains the Ether, its confused usage and contextual contradictory reference is commonplace,
as would
be likewise in the case of any non-physical concept without a locus that is or has been reified objectively. A field (
all Ether) is not a
concept, not a physical medium (of course all physical medium are Ether in principle, as the terminus of dielectricity),
not an
abstraction, but the subject itself, the medium itself and often only qualified in instances to which it is induced or
brought into

dynamic macro-effective perturbations that cannot be ignored. That all fields are sourced in counterspace yet have
spatial variants and
without a definite locus other than pressure gradients when amplified or induced is not in question. There are no
particles used in
mediating a field, that is strictly the realm of GR and quantum absurdities that fail on rational, logical and
mathematical levels,
additionally always on the experimental level. While used casually everywhere in pseudo-science, any attempt by academia
to
rationally define a field is non-existent, and the highly typical habit of conjugating a field with space or as space is
both illogical and
wholly unjustified; is purely an ignorant remnant from GR as parroted thru unscientific quantum, of which both are
mutually
incompatible.
The conundrum of their misunderstandings, in part, is that fields are mass-free (though gravity is sourced in mass, its
field is mass-
free), particle-free (of any variety), are not physical objects or subjects, however it is evidently and abundantly
clear they have
physical effects without end; this of course is the very definition of Tesla’s ‘medium’, or Ether. While all fields
witnessed in
phenomenal influences are archetypes of space, the Ether is not conjugate to, part of, dependent upon or relational to
space, nor is
there Ether in space, rather space as a polarized dimensional measure of fields and the masses created by same. Space is
only
relational to masses and magnitudes and the distances between them. To conceptualize a field as a region can only
pertain to a
perturbation of the field as witnessed from phenomenal effects by same upon other bodies or as a region consubstantial
to TEM.
Einstein and his disciples argue that fields and space are equivalent. What meaning would space have in a universe
devoid of matter?
Whether gravitational, magnetic, or electric, we need ‘masses’ or ‘charges’ to talk about a field. This argument
summarily debunks
Einstein’s irrational proposal that field and space are synonyms. Einstein was extremely weak on logic in all of his
proposals. He was
not a very intelligent or rational individual; he was a mediocre mathematician, not a scientist. Magnets do not generate
attraction and
repulsion by throwing particle showers collectively called ‘field’ at each other as proposed by QM. All fields are
radial or polarized,
or circular, and either spatial or counterspatial depending upon their movements, instantaneous action at a distance is
mediated
between any two objects connected by a pressure gradient of the Either in the field(s) of influence, including
compounded fields.
Circular illogical statements made by and thru mathematical ‘science’ cannot be enjoined: “field: a region of space...
region: a
portion of space...space: the infinite extension of field”. To employ space to define a field or field to prop up or
define space or be
synonymous with space are all wrong, logically, and demonstrably. A field can never terminate in space nor is a field
even part of
space itself, rather is a dimensional measure of a field or fields, of counterspace, and used contextually as an
explicit reference of
influences of or by empirical objects as mediated thru or from a field**_. Some have, out of desperation to their
materialistic
mentalities conceded defeat: “A field is an enigma, a question mark. A question cannot serve as an answer in
Physics”._** Einstein
himself said that so far as his general relativity is concerned, “space (actually spacetime) and the gravitational field
are the same
things”, this type of ‘thinking’ is pure idiocy of the highest order.
A region is not equivalent to the thing occupying the region itself. Insanity provides that a field, the mediator,
occupies space
(which it does not, counterspace cannot ‘occupy space’, there is no counterspace IN space!) or a field is in space,
which again it is not;
space is within a polarized field or fields or rationalized between fields (rather reified) but the Ether is
counterspace, and likewise
**cannot be IN SPACE,** rather space is within the Ether when manifest in phenomena or polarized. Einstein claims that a
gravitational
field is space: _“ There can be no space nor any part of space without gravitational potentials; for these confer upon
space its metrical
qualities, without which it cannot be imagined at all. The existence of the gravitational field is inseparably bound up
with the
existence of space.”_ This circular conceptual reification is a logical fallacy, space has never, and never will be
shown to influence
anything, nor are space and field interchangeable whatsoever. Einstein was a mental midget for this declaration. If it
were, as Einstein
insanely states, that a gravitational field = space and the gravitational gradient drops as we move away from the Earth,
what has
changed in the constituents of space, nothing is the answer. This is outright insanity for which the world lauds such
foolishness.

_“There appears to be in the minds of these (supposed) eminent men, some prejudice, or a priori object against the
hypothesis of a
medium (the Ether) in which the phenomena of light, electrical actions at a distance take place...the existence of a
medium in which
light is propagated. But in all these theories (the insane Atomistic ones) the question naturally occurs: If something
is transmitted
from one particle to another at distance, what is the condition of it after it has left one particle and before it
reaches another? If this
something is the potential energy of the two particles, as in Neumann’s theory, how are we to conceive of this energy
existing in a
point of space, coinciding with neither one particle nor the other? In fact, whenever energy is transmitted from one
body to another in
time,_ **_there MUST BE A MEDIUM OR SUBSTANCE IN WHICH THE ENERGY EXISTS_** _after it leaves one body before it
reaches the other, for energy, as Torricelli remarked, is a ‘quintessence of so subtle a nature that it cannot be
contained in ANY vessel
except in the inmost substance of a thing (counterspace/ dielectricity, the Ether)’...”_ *

**Below: Contrary to human conceptualization, as pertains fields rather than empirical objects, increasing movement is
decreasing inertia, and decreasing movement is increasing inertia, however this increasing inertia is apparently (only)
achieved by increasing movement towards voidance, but said increased movement is the proportionality of the decreasing
sphere of space (= motion) between two or more objects. The highest expression of inertia is one in which movement is at
maximum resistance, or magnetic reluctivity, as found in bismuth for example. To add to this confusion, in the voidance
of
increasing inertia there is increasing physical movement which is pressure mediation directed at decreasing movement
ultimately. As such we can accurately state that an iron object accelerating towards a “magnet” is decreasing movement
in
voiding the space between it and the “magnet” thereby decreasing the space, which is movement definitionally. The
shrinking
spatial sphere between objects undergoing mutual spatial (=movement, polarization) voidance is the elimination of
movement.
While apparently moving fast in voidance, the shrinking spatial sphere of voidance denotates decreasing movement and
spatial voidance. Divergent movement and convergent movement are two wholly different quantities. One indicates
increasing
inertia, the other decreasing inertia. All divergent motion in creating space is immanently decreasing; all convergent
motion in
voiding space is immanently increasing motion, but only as an expression of the shrinking spatial sphere between both,
and
only halts at highest dielectric inertia, or voidance; as such we must state that convergent voidance is the dissipation
of all
motion by increased motion (which is really spatially elimination) to full voidance of same in eliminating the motional
polarization, or space, between the two objects. This motion is as regards the shrinking sphere(s) of space between
these
objects and said motion is not an attribute of either object in their motions towards increased acceleration and
voidance of all
motion. The speed of light is only a quantity of the rate of induction as measured in time of either voidance of
countervoidance,
or as meant the terminal velocity of divergence or convergence of magnitudinal, transverse fields.**

Faraday wondered why, when the distance between two objects is doubled their mutual attraction (voidance) for one
another falls
off to one-fourth the former. Faraday was highly dubious regarding Newtons conclusions about force. The fact is that the
“missing
three-fourths of the force” is not lost whatsoever, the loss of mutual acceleration is in counterspace and mediated
between both
dielectricity and magnetism, both impelled by and ‘lost’ therein; this is a natural attribute to dielectricity, either
as found in the so-
called “magnet” or in its aggregated form as found in mass/matter. Newton’s equation is not about force, or as argued by
others,
tension, rather **dielectric voidance**. In which case we have the equation of Newton corrected: **D.V. = M1 x M2/
Distance^2. All
acceleration of bodies via gravity or “magnets” are undergoing dielectric voidance, or magnetic (so-called) induction
and
resultant acceleration is the simplex process of dielectric voidance.** The presumed increasing or decreasing ‘force’ is
merely a field
attribute necessitated by which spatial voidance is enacted to mediate the dielectric field voidances which eliminate
space in their
accelerations towards pressure voidances created by magnetism. Absolute acceleration is zero empirical movement, or
perfect Ether
inertia.
F=ma is correctly pertaining to “magnetism” and gravity: Voidance = dielectricity as measured in mass x acceleration. As
stated,
magnetism cannot, has never attracted or accelerated anything, rather only causes dielectric coherency and resultant
acceleration by
means of dielectricity in voidance. **Both gravity and so-called “magnetic attraction” operate off the principle of
shrinking
spheres of dielectric voidance in which, as found in the case of both, the decreasing spherical area is proportional to
the**

**voidance and resulting acceleration.** Faradays “missing three-fourths of the force” is not missing, it is and always
has been a
translational exchange between increasing or decreasing space in which both magnetism and dielectricity mediate field
pressures.
Contrary to empirical phenomena and objects which are in motion and are denoted to have ‘inertia’ and likewise its
opposite being
‘rest’; the inverse is true of dielectric inertia or the Ether membrane in specific, its termination is movement, is
polarization (i.e.
magnetism), is work, action. Additionally the fact that the universe is speeding up in acceleration has been declared a
mystery by the
fools of academia, since this is contrary to their conclusions. However this acceleration is PROOF the universe is
decreasing in
movement and winding down, just the inverse of their idiotic understanding that the accelerating galaxies are proof of
increasing
divergence or movement. Just the opposite is the case; this correct measurement of accelerating galaxies is proof of
their ‘winding
down’ into voidance.
As per the dielectric, the Ether, its innate unperturbed (usually) state, that inertia in termination is movement, work,
action,
polarization. All inertia discharge is movement, work, polarization, to couple out of that membrane at rest is action,
the Ether in loss
of inertia must translate into work, action, and the complete opposite of rest. The loss of field inertia is translated
into empirical and
phenomenal work, if this were not the case, nothing could be powered or run off the feed lines of electrical
magneto-dielectric inertia
which flows down the lines into your home. As such, contrary to phenomena in motion by which we denotate rest of same
phenomena
as a lost of inertia, the absolute inverse is the case for fields.
An atomic explosion, of which all matter is still present and not converted (contrary to Einstein and wholly backed by
Tesla) there
is a loss of inter-atomic inertia. The uranium, plutonium, or tritium are still within the mushroom cloud. All of the
original
components needed to reconstruct the transformed atoms to their initial nuclear states are speeding away in all
directions and could, in
principle, be reassembled back into the original nuclei. To reassemble these components would require the same amount of
kinetic
energy that was released in the explosion. The energy of the explosion comes not from converting matter to energy, but
from the
kinetic inter-atomic energy released. This energy did not just appear from a transformation of matter into energy as
Einstein and his
fools have forwarded, but was always contained within the internal motions of the inter-atomic and nucleal dielectric
inertia. The only
transformation that occurred was the conversion of rotational kinetic energy into linear kinetic energy. An atomic
explosion, for
example, is nothing more complex than many many trillion tightly wound pocket watches which are near instantly
disassembled
releasing their stored inertia. All the parts and gears are present after the fact. No matter or ‘gears’ were or are
converted into energy.
Tesla derided this insane premise of Einstein, and rightly so.

**Atomists and relativists quoted in black, the corrections are in blue**
Atomist: “We cannot take a snapshot of a field because, on the one hand, a field is not a stand-alone object, and on the
other, it is a
dynamic concept.”
This is not the case; the field is an arena of influence by Ether pressure gradients. This arena is dynamic and flowing.
Atomist: A field is a physical relation between two objects that compels one or both to move.
This is not the case, a single mass-object in a field has space within that field, that there is not a secondary object
under influence of
the field has no bearing on the matter.

Atomist: A field is not a like the still waters of a swimming pool. A field is better likened to the word wind. You
can’t take a snap-shot
of a field. You can only film it. If you took a picture, it is not of a field. Yet the dynamic notion of field is
conceptually at odds with
the static notion of region. Either a field is a flowing river or it is a static halo. It can’t be both
The Ether itself is the ‘still waters’ of the pool. A field is likened to “wind” only when two objects are interacting,
either by gravity, or
induction, or charge-discharge. A field is immaterial, is not mediated by particles, as such there is no ‘picture of a
field’, yet their
influences are well known by all. There is no “at odds” with a field, what something is in principle, or subject, so it
is in activity,
influence, induction, gravitation, electrification, or polarized magnetism. A “snapshot” of a magnetic field, or a
single line of it
specifically is a halo, however that magnetism reciprocates like a flowing river, centripetally and centrifugally can be
denied by none.
Relativist, mathematical explanation nonsense: “ Field: the space around a radiating body within which its
electromagnetic oscillations
can exert force on another similar body not in contact with it”
Conceptual reification fallacy, a field is not space, nor inversely so. Space operates on nothing. There is space within
any field, as
necessitated by its polarization, but there is no field in space, as being implied ‘another medium’. Space is a
dimensional abstraction.
Relativist, mathematical explanation nonsense: “ Field: a mathematical entity which can be thought of as a collection of
numbers”
Conceptual reification fallacy of a field as a numerical abstraction.
Relativist, mathematical explanation nonsense: “ Field is a physics term for a region that is under the influence of
some force that can
act on matter within that region.”
Conceptual reification fallacy of a region as = field. A field influence is pressure gradient based, centripetal,
centrifugal, polarized, or
radial.
Relativist, mathematical explanation nonsense: “ Every magnet produces an invisible area of influence around itself...
Scientists call
these invisible influences fields. You can make magnetic fields visible to the eye by using iron chips sprinkled on a
piece of paper
with a magnet underneath.”
Using iron dust to show a snapshot of a field line is not making a field visible, only its attributional influences
visible.
Relativist, mathematical explanation nonsense: “ Two kinds of physical objects must coexist: particles...and fields.”
Fields are not physical objects, of this, it is abundantly clear from endless experimentation.
Relativist, mathematical explanation nonsense: “Field: a region of space... region: a portion of space...space: the
infinite extension of
field”
This is circular, fallacious, and highly illogical.

_“According to the General Theory of Relativity (pure bunk), space without Ether is unthinkable.”_ **_- A. Einstein_**

_“The word Ether has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics only because its past association with
opposition to
relativity. This is unfortunate because stripped of these connotations, it nicely captures the way most physicists
actually thin about the
vacuum. The modern concept of vacuum space confirmed by every experiment is a relativistic Ether. But we do not call it
this because
Ether is a taboo term.”_ **_- Robert B. Laughlin_**

_“Einstein and his ilk reified space as ‘something’ that ‘did things’ and ‘acted upon things’. This is the fallacy of
attribute reification,
and is a titanic error of thought and theory. Einstein has blamed the flies (forces) on the horse feces (space),
completely ignoring the
horse (fields) entirely. This brain wasting idiocy can and must come to an end given time and intelligent minds to see
clearly. Nobody
who has ever lived has seen space ‘do’ anything.”_ **_- Author_**

_“Nothing is “shot” out of the moving laser. The electric field can only ‘soak into the medium’ at the rate defined by

Most everything you touch every day has its birth with Tesla. Absolutely nothing you use, touch, or need or otherwise
has its
origins in Einstein’s writings or creations, of which there are none. Tesla described relativity as "a beggar wrapped in
purple whom
ignorant people take for a king." The theory, "he said, "wraps all these errors and fallacies and clothes them in
magnificent
mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar
clothed in
purple whom ignorant people take for a king. Its exponents are very brilliant men, but they are metaphysicists rather
than scientists.
Not a single one of the relativity propositions has been proved." **– N. Tesla**
What is the Ether, or in specific, what do we know of same? The Ether is the inertial plane whose XYZ-axis is at every
‘point’ in
which space can be found within the Ether but not the inverse, but of course this Ether precedes space itself and
defines space which is
co-relational only to magnitudes (not mass, which is the domain of the Ether) and time. This inertial membrane / plane
can be brought
into phenomenalization thru magnetic perturbations of the dielectric plane, or likewise in polarization from
electrification of a mass

creating an Ether bubble, or portal, likewise gravity and otherwise. Ether can move spatially (rather space moves in the
Ether) as
polarized (magnetism) centripetally (dielectricity or gravity) or centrifugally, depending on the variety of the field,
magnetic,
gravitational, electrical, dielectric. What is moving, and the movement itself is the aoristos dyad of the Greeks,
Principle and attribute
are one and the same entity, as is light and illumination. Will and willing. To speak of the Ether and an Ether bubble
or vortex is
merely the conceptual bifurcation of one thing, as differentiated in principle (as the Ether), as against itself in
attribute (as a vortex,
movement, or field-causative), but this differentiation is purely an empirical consciousness based construct.
An extremely important point that must be grasped, otherwise nothing can be understood about anything really, is that
Ether only
gives rise to Ether. What does this mean? It means that magnetic fields are the resultant movements and terminations of
electrical
fields, which is another spatial vector of the movement of the Ether, or a dielectric centripetal radial Ether dominance
gives rise to
macro-magnetic appearances of magnetism, as in the case of a permanent magnet. Dielectric Ether fields in special
geometric forms
gives rise to the creation of matter which itself is a stable form (“strong nuclear force”) of dielectricity, which then
has its own field,
centripetal gravitational fields. All fields were created, or are the result of the termination of another field of
Ether. This extremely
important point cannot be lost, or misunderstood, otherwise nothing can be understood.
All humanity currently is focused on efficient ways to transform one type or modality of Ether movement into another
type! Falling
water (centripetal gravitational Ether field) is forced to pass thru a turbine which forces a polarized magnetic Ether
field to cause
torque on a dielectric reflector (A dielectric reflector is in reality a dielectric transmission medium [like to like],
it is a ‘magnetic
reflector’ such that it can, in electrification, be pulsed and its superluminal dielectric inter-atomic inertial plane
torqued as a sweeping
magnetic field causes dielectric precessional torsion, which produces electrification), and this copper structure
creates electrification,
another polarized electrical Ether disturbance to reflect down the lines and thru substations to feed your microwave (
electromagnetic
Ether field, polarized), or your AC unit or fan, such that you have an electrical field of the Ether dumping out at the
‘end of the line’
from AC generator to AC motor. Light rays (dielectro-electromagnetic structure, with a radial and coaxial dielectric
component) from
the sun, these dielectric (Ether field, radial) inductions cause induction in solar cells, and feed other types of field
requirements and
needs. All humanity is in the business of using or creating (most without knowing it) field manipulations. Nuclear
reactions based
upon stable dielectric matter-fields which are in unstable atomic geometries which radiate nucleal particles, (radiation
being a field
function of the Ether). Burning flammable coal, or gas, or oil, part of mass, which itself is a dielectric field unit
within the nuclear
elemental, the atomic.
Instead of ‘conservation of energy’, it should be called the ‘conservation of the Ether’. However all fields are induced
or
transferred thru to another by the Ether alone, this means that induction cannot occur where the Ether is not, and
likewise it means that
(Tesla’s discovery) inertia and momentum can be discharged by equilibrium with the Ether by a special means of
grounding. Meaning
a terawatt of power can vanish with no resultant effect, or that you could create a system where a body could decelerate
from 1000
MPH to 0 with no resultant forwards momentum, friction, or inertia. Contrary to popular belief that “energy cannot be
destroyed, only
transferred” is a myth. This only holds true if induction is possible and natural, energy can indeed be ‘lost’
completely, as was first
discovered in AC generation stations where, before the generators got up to working inertias, enormous power is lost for
a short time
with no resultant dissipation into our world. Ether is the "ultimate" medium (Tesla often interchanged the term "medium"
with
"Ether") - being a perfect ‘fluid’ and transporting independent carriers. Tesla said that electromagnetic radiation was
propagated, like
sound waves in the Ether. GR and QM, the cult of quantum, has merely displaced the Ether as “dark matter” which
according to their
(likely incorrect) calculations, comprises almost all the universe. Which means in fact, in their myopic
misunderstanding, that the
remaining few percent of the Universe are merely bundled Ether fields in stable forms (for a while) as plasma, elements,
magnetism,
gravity, and likewise. Therefore ultimately, of course, all is the Ether.
"Too bad, Sir Isaac, they dimmed your renown and turned your great science upside down. **Now a long haired crank,
Einstein by
name** , puts on your high teaching all the blame. (he) Says: matter and force are transmutable and wrong the laws you
thought
immutable. I am much too ignorant, my son, for grasping (crazy) schemes so finely spun.” **- N. Tesla (Fragments of
Olympian
Gossip. by Nikola Tesla regarding Einstein)**
“Ether is the cause of every magnetic field. Electricity could not exist without the Ether. Ether is the medium for all
EM waves
from radio to gamma. Every particle in the universe is bathed in a sea of Ether, including the (so-called) electrons of
atoms and
plasma. Ether is how particles ‘know’ they are moving near the speed of light in a vacuum, even if they are accelerated
very slowly.
When the Ether gets cold enough, its properties change causing strange phenomena to both atoms and light. Using very
cold
temperatures is a way to isolate exactly what the Ether affects; cold temperatures are to Ether physics what
accelerators are to particle
physics.” - **N. Tesla**
Tesla said of theory of relativity: "a mass of error and deceptive ideas violently opposed to the teachings of great men
of science of
the past and even to common sense." - **N. Tesla**
Tesla stated that there was no energy in matter other than that received from its environment, i.e. the Ether. This is
the most
suppressed statement from N. Tesla himself: “ _... Supposing that the bodies act upon the surrounding space causing
curving of the
same, it appears to my simple mind that the curved spaces must react on the bodies, and producing the opposite effects,
straightening
out the curves. Since action and reaction are coexistent, it follows that the supposed curvature of space is entirely
impossible – But
even if it existed it would not explain the motions of the bodies as observed. Only the existence of a field of force
can account for the
motions of the bodies as observed, and its assumption dispenses with space curvature. All literature on this subject is
futile and
destined to oblivion. So are all attempts to explain the workings of the universe without recognizing the existence of
the Ether and the
indispensable function it plays in the phenomena. My second discovery was of a physical truth of the greatest
importance. As I have
searched the entire scientific records in more than a half dozen languages for a long time without finding the least
anticipation, I
consider myself the original discoverer of this truth, which can be expressed by the statement: There is no energy in
matter other than
that received from the environment._ ” - **N. Tesla**

“I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that **it can have no properties.”** - **N. Tesla**
“Today’s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation,
and
eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality. ” - **N. Tesla**
“In the writings of J. J. Thompson it is found he considered dielectric propagation and magnetic propagation can be
independent.
Also considered is that **magnetism is a secondary response to dielectric forces**. This is also found in the writings
of C. P. Steinmetz,
“Transients in Space”, from “Theory and Calculation of Transient Electric Phenomena”. Here is the “Hysteresis of the
Ether”, the
alternative to the concept of electromagnetic radiation”. **–E. Dollard**
"When the electric current comes into being, it immediately sets the surrounding Ether into some kind of instantaneous
motion, the
nature of which has still not been exactly determined. In spite of the continuation of the cause of this motion, namely
the electric
current, the motion ceases, but the Ether remains in a potential state and produces a magnetic field. That the magnetic
field is a
potential state [of the Ether] is shown by the [existence of a] permanent magnet, since the principle of conservation of
energy excludes
the possibility of a state of motion in this case. The motion of the Ether, which is caused by an electric current, will
continue until the
acting [electro-] motive forces are compensated by the equivalent passive forces which arise from the deformation caused
by the
motion of the Ether itself." –(“ **Concerning the Investigation of the State of Ether in Magnetic Fields” by Albert
Einstein)**

previous
centuries of its existence.”_ **_– Nikola Tesla (referring to Ether science)_**

“There is no energy in matter other than that received from its environment (as meant Ether fields).” – Nikola Tesla

_“Both dielectric and magnetic fields exert mechanical force upon the bounding system of so-called "conductors." These
mechanical
forces, those of the dielectric, and those of the magnetic, exert actions so as to increase their coefficients of
induction, that is the
dielectric "capacitance", and the magnetic "inductance" are increased. Hereby, the dielectric field draws the conductors
nearer to
each other, increasing the counterspace. Conversely the magnetic field pushes the conductors away from each other,
increasing the
space. Hereby we may say that the dielectric field is contractive, and the magnetic field is expansive.”_ *

**Below: From the book ‘De Divina Proportione’ (About the divine proportions [the golden ratio]) by Luca Pacioli 1509.
The
book was illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci. On the left you can see space, and on the right, counterspace, or
inverse-space, or
‘negative-space’. Dielectricity is counterspace. Only two copies exist of this work.**

Dielectricity is the Ether boundary, the inertial plane, and the membrane at which only another conjugate polarized
field can torque
to create other phenomena.

Fundamentally people cannot wrap their minds around the fact that moving a magnetic field against a magnetic reflector
which
causes electrification is piercing the Ether membrane and is the transference of inertia from a prime mover (water
moving the magnet,
or wind, nuclear etc.) into the creation of electricity, and via natures way dielectricity terminating into the creation
of matter. There is
nothing in the magnet, or in the copper coil which is creating electrification, the magneto-dielectric field geometries
of both working
together as oppositionally moving co-principle conjugates in and of nature are creating the electrical current. This is
why Tesla said
that you “cannot get energy out of matter”. Counterspace is literally the space between space itself, the very
omnipresent membrane
of the Ether which requires conjugate field forces to bring it into space or create electrical or dielectric, or
magnetic phenomena, or the
even the creation of matter.

**Below: It is impossible to understand the most fundamental Ether-modality, dielectricity, without a firm grasp of
counterspace. It is likewise impossible to understand magneto-dielectric incommensurable field conjugation without a
firm
grasp of dielectric inertia, which is centripetal, counterspatial, radial, and has no magnitude of its own accord except
in
divergent discharge, as magnetism; another Ether-modality and co-principle conjugate with dielectricity, together of
which
both are the two fundamental Ether energy modalities of the universe.**

How do you compress or torque something that isn’t ‘there’ (in space)? By fields and by fields alone, which all fields
are Ether by
nature. Ether induces the Ether, as any one of several different types of fields or phenomena depending on the scenario.

**Below: Manifold space, one counterspace; inertia. One of the two is a stereographic projection and therefore = 0, but
counted
as 1 (and more), the other has no spatial definition, and therefore empirically = 0, but ultimately = 1.**

**Below: Dielectric radiant discharge**

The Ether is always trying to terminate back into counterspace, its origin and fulcrum, it is only by reciprocation,
movements and
countless other phenomena that it is ‘kept’ in space (for a short while, but an eternity as measured by the life of any
human). In saying
‘counterspace’ we are talking about the Ether itself, its principle, its domain. Space is the vector of phenomena,
counterspace is the
fulcrum of phenomena and is the inertial plane, or membrane of the Ether from which all phenomena are manifest in space.
Counterspace is the noumenon, which when disturbed, gives rise to phenomena. The question then must be raised, how does
the Ether,
where there are no fields, produce anything to begin with? The Greeks answered that long ago and the answer is divinely
simplex,
however left for another article.
Magnetism is purely radiative, is the termination of electrification and the end-of-road byproduct of dielectricity.
Dielectricity
comes before everything else in the four-part schema of Force Unification. **Dielectricity and magnetism are the two
co-principles
of the universe**. So how do you get magnetism out of dielectricity, since magnetism requires a subject to emanate from
or itself is the
termination point of either mass in movement or electricity as it terminates? The answer is that dielectricity
terminates into the
creation of matter, which itself then has in this conjugate relationship, magnetism as its radiative principle (the
proton as found in
hydrogen, the most abundant element is magnetically dominant, is the polarized charging dynamo for its discharge plane
of
interatomic magneto-dielectric volume). Creation (dielectricity) and radiation (magnetism), and their two byproducts,
electricity and
mass, or gravity as centripetal attributes choate to mass / matter.

**Below: One need only to hold up a circular Moire’ pattern (representing magnetism) against a linear (dielectric
inertial plane)
Moire’ pattern and move both back and forth just a bit to see what is occuring in the process of creating
electrification. Quite
literally, electrification is the product of the counterspatial dielectric geometry interacting, over time, with the
magnetic spatial
circular geometry creating an Ether-based interference preturbation with the resultant perpendicular creation of
electricity.
On the left we have circular magnetism and middle, the radial dielectric, on the far right we have the product of the
two,
electrification.**

**Likewise if you layer two horizontal dielectric Moire’ paterns perpendicular to each other to represent the
dimensional
interlacing radial grid patern in the conductor, and then move the circular magnetic Moire’ pattern over both of those
you
will get the full picture of both the electrification and magnetic induction occuring in the conductor.**

**Magnetic precession rates of the gyromagnetic-ratio at 42.4923 Mhz/T in creating the magnetic vortex
Precessional (vortex) Geometry is also Phi-Phi-1Precession**

**Precession is a universal absolute and constant in a conjugate system of fields where magnetism moves opposite to
dielectricity**

In the magneto-dielectric double hyperbola disk model, precession is due to the nucleal magnetism inherent in the
proton(s) at the
center of every magneto-dielectric atomic volume which is caused to precess by the powerful dielectric inertial plane
and likewise
therefore the magnetic expanding Z-axis polarized plane to precess in kind to its apex initiator, the protonic nucleal
dynamo which is
being impelled to coherent phased precession by the powerful and saturated dielectric inertial plane.

There must exist 3 COHERENT ASPECTS for a magnet to be a “magnet” and thereby have ‘perfect’ field incommensurability
which
defines a permanent (or an electromagnet) with its attributional properties. 1. XY-axis dielectric inertial planes in
coherent field
incommensurability alignment. 2. Expanding Z-axis circular spatial reciprocating magnetism in coherent field
incommensurability
alignment. 3. Phased coherent dielectric inertial plane spins all operating in the same centripetal radial movements of
field
incommensurability alignment.

**Below: Showing the magnetic and dielectric XYZ conjugate system of both fields moving oppositionally in a binding
system
which also necessitates precessional movement.**

**Gyromagnetic ratios, and magnetic precession is nothing of my discovery** , this principle is part and parcel to **all
magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) technology** , however the entire field of MRI
technology
is senseless and clueless that a permanent magnet exhibits this due to special magneto-dielectric field geometry. MRI
use enormous
power to generate these magnetic precessions, which field contrasts are then used to image and determine what is being
scanned.
Enormous pulsing power is used in the creation of MRI images, however a single large pulse is used to create an
identical precessional
magnetic geometry in the permanent magnet. As is the case with most technology, things are discovered and perfected
without
actually understanding or caring about the principles behind them.

Why the seeming ‘obsession’ with using gyroscopes in making models and analogies of magnetism? The fact is that both
have 3
important axes and importantly a very near-identical fourth principle, the inertial torque plane, or flywheel of the
gyroscope which is
nearly identically mirrored in the dielectric inertial plane. Of the two models, the only differences are that one is
physical and the other
is magneto-dielectric, or purely field-based. However both employ principles of phasing, spin, inertia, coherency, and
acceleration,
additionally that of torque. The analogy ends of course at field inductions which are at a distance and not mediated by
particles or
contact.

**Below: Detailed angles and degrees of precession (not to scale) in a perfect “magnet” system. Ratio of Phi-Phi (

(magnetic). Or a ratio of 3.23606 dielectricity to 1 magnetic. Precessional angle and magnetic frequency is 42.4923 (~
42.5). 42.5
x Phi = 68.7539 degrees maximum precession in the conjugate system.**

Identical to CW on CW or CCW on CCW of approaching magnets, the spinning gyroscope will raise up in the air (voidance)
only
when spun OPPOSITE TO THE PHASE OF MOVEMENT of its flywheel, if a gyroscopic flywheel is moving CW and the flywheel
is moved CW, there is strong counter-voidance, however if a flywheel is moving CW and a applied CCW motion is applied to
the
gyroscopic system, then the flywheel will rise to that movement, which is its counterspatial apex of voidance. Magnetism
is identical
in that CW on CW approaches are a counter-voidance inertial plane torque of immense resistance. **Remembering that in
any perfect
magnet, the dielectric is 3.23 (phi times 2) times bigger than the magnetic which is 1. A ratio of 3.236 to 1.**

**Below: Showing the simplex nature of a phased dielectric field causing proton(s)ic precession and likewise resultant
magnetic
field precession centrifugally from the apex-locus of the protons being in a state of precession. Protons are
magnetically
charged particles naturally regardless of the system. Both the dielectric inertial plane and the magnetic Z-axis
circular field
are under a state of precession. The dielectric from the centripetal returning magnetic vortex and the nucleus of
proton(s), and
the magnetic centrifugal field under precession from apex-nucleal proton(s) precession. The order of causation is 1.
Dielectric
acceleration and saturation (from electrification in the creation of a magnet). 2. Nucleal proton(s) precessing
coherently under
the centripetal radial dielectric (since they are magnetically induced particles). 3. Centrifugal magnetic field
precession due to
the precessing proton(s). 4. Resultant dielectric precession due to magnetic reciprocation both centrifugal and
centripetal
around (centrifugal), towards (centripetal), and at (intermediate centrifugal) returning not at the inverse spin or
‘pole’ but
along the dielectric inertial plane. The cycle is now complete with two fields causing and being caused into mutual
precession
from and towards one another in the binding system.**

Centripetal to centripetal voidance is the operational prima causa to both gravity and to magnetism, this vortex
movement to
equilibrium by voidance is how both masses self-void in equilibrium and how dielectricity self-voids in equilibrium by
brining low-
pressure magnetic reciprocations into counterspatial collapse.

Precession and phasing of the dielectric inertial plane (being in phase once electrified) is the second attribute to the
double-
hyperbola-disk magnetodielectric geometry of Field Incommensurability. Coherent field incommensurability in the
conjugation of
inversely-moving field phenomena (magnetism and dielectricity) in a binding system necessitates this special geometry (
see below)
and additionally the precessional coherent phasing which comprises not only the polarization of the magnetic field which
it is
definitionally, but its vortex spin phenomena as the nucleal proton(s) precess against the dielectric inertial plane and
likewise
resultantly precession, in a vortex pattern, the polarized macro-magnetic dominances of the “magnet”.
Three parts are at play in two field forces that are 180 degrees oppositional within a bounding system, the
spatial-counterspatial
conjugate geometry of the radial centripetal dielectricity and the circular centrifugal (and centripetal) magnetism.
Both magnetism and
dielectricity are, in the binding system, moving apart from each other and likewise (compounded by the returning
centripetal
magnetism) gimballing, or precessing against each other. Polarization is understood (from the section on magnetism
below), however
the last and final more complex (but utterly simplex and logical) principle of mutual field precession is necessary to
demonstrate
vortex movement reciprocation of magnetism in a phased system of dielectric dominance.

**Below: Showing states of precession from dielectric torque being exerted upon the protons in the nucleus.**

Polarization is necessitated by the definition of magnetism itself, but also secondarily, as mentioned before, magnetism
never exists by
itself, and only as attributional to electricity terminating thru a dielectrically capacitant mass or otherwise (TEM,
circular field around
AC and DC lines, etc.). This conjugate necessity of nature is, to wit, that magnetism is only present as an attribute to
another which is
prior (however both are co-eternal and consubstantial, or ‘where there is one you will always find the other’), i.e.
“WHAT is the
source or locus of polarization?” Ether being counterspatial, a polarized spatially expanding Ether disturbance is
secondary to a
precedent initiating the polarization. In the case of a “magnet” (dielectric object) the dielectric inertial plane
causes precession of the
apex situated proton(s) which likewise cause necessitated precession, however the perfect equilibrium of precession
against the
dielectric plane is a ratio of 1 against Phi. This angle is 42.492 (42.5~) degrees, which is also the frequency in Mhz/T
of the proton,
however this is incorrectly published as 42.5781, it is at perfect equilibrium at 42.492, but this is a minor
difference.

**Below: Left, showing protonic precession from radial dielectric influence. Middle and right, showing the precessional
geometry as products of acceleration, force, and lateral torque.**

In a perfect magnet, with perfect properties, **the ratio of the presence of dielectricity to magnetism is 3.23606 (phi
x 2) quantities
of dielectricity to 1 part quantity of magnetism**. This is why a “magnet” is really a dielectric object, however the
counterspatial and
radial qualities of dielectricity make this almost unapparent to any conventional sensory observational inquiry.

Since magnetism is radiation by definition, this resultant “permanent” charge ratio of 3.23606 dielectric to 1 part
magnetism (in a
perfect example) is kept in place. If it were on a 1 to 1 ratio, then after capacitors banks dropped the pulse charge to
the coils to induce
dis-equilibrium into the “magnet” in creation, then the resultant, of course would be no different than before
electrified induction from
the coils into the “magnet”. This special ferrous, or lattice-neodymium composite (especially) allows for dielectric
charge retention
‘permanently’, unless of course destroyed from charge, shock, heat, etc.

The feature of a spinning gyroscope is that it appears to defy gravity and precess, whereas a non-spinning gyroscope
falls down. The
cause of the precessional motion and the gyroscope’s stability toward falling is attributed to the external force of
gravity, however this
is incorrect, it is due to centrifugally spinning mass moving against a centripetal field locus created at the center of
the flywheel from
counter-natural movement, and this likewise is the counterspatial torque inherent to a physical gyroscope causing its
precession, and
exerts a torque "sideways" on the angular momentum vector. This torque produces the non-intuitive result of precession.
By analogy,
in the presence of an applied dielectric field, the coupling of the magnetic polarized reciprocation with the dielectric
field produces a
torque that precesses the expanding Z-axis radial magnetic vectors and causes them to precess about the dielectric field
movement.

**Below: Showing precessional movements based upon torque, and lateral forces of dielectricity upon the nucleus which
induce
centrifugal spin upon the Z-axis expanding and reciprocating magnetic fields.**

Protons precess coherently when in the presence of a powerful dielectric field. The frequency at which the precession
occurs is called
the Larmor frequency. This causes an oscillating and precessing magnetic field that can be measured.

In electrification in the creation of a “magnet” not only are the XYZ vectors of magneto-dielectric inertial planes
brought into
coherency, so too are the directions of their dielectric ‘flywheels’ all amplified to the same direction. Just like our
gyroscopic analogy,
you can have 10 gyroscopes with their flywheels all spinning in different directions and yet their XYZ axis of the
magneto-dielectric
volumes are still aligned, however in touching all 10 at the same time, you will get variegated precessional incoherent
reactions.
However as is in the case with electrification and dielectric saturation in the creation of a “magnet”, all dielectric
inter-atomic fields
are accelerated in a singular pulse of phased dielectric coherency. This is also why CW on CW magnetic approaches causes
immense
Ether pressure resistance (counter-voidance), because the dielectric-momentum of all the many trillions of atoms in the
“magnet” are
resisting breaking torque from an outside pressure of counter-voidance. This is in-phase precession post-electrification
in creating a
magnet.

**Below: Precessional model in reverse, where a counter-voidance magnet hanging from above is causing precession in the
axis
(nucleus) of the inertial system below it. In the correct model, reverse of below, the dielectric inertial plane is
causing nucleal
precession and resultant Z-axis magnetic field precession, the source of vortex circulation of any magnetic system.**

The creation of a magnet from dielectric saturation is the first step in creating macro-magnetic predominance, but the
in-phase
magnetic precession in electrification is the driving power behind “strong attraction and repulsion” (rather voidance
and counter-
voidance). This dielectric phasing causes proton(s) precessional coherent phasing and likewise in kind magnetic field
phasing. All
pressures are precessing and polarized against lowest pressure reciprocation.

The cones of possible orientations become cones of possible precession for the angular momentum and magnetic vectors in
the
presence of a coupling dielectric field.

**Below: Dielectric phasing in the creation of a magnet is responsible for the enormous torque of either voidance or
counter-
voidance (‘repulsion’). This enormous compounded torque from trillions of in-phase inter-atomic dielectric inertial
planes is a
main component of the inaccurate assumption that magnetic “attraction or repulsion” is driven or has its causation in
the
magnetism itself, when in fact this is due to the in-phase dielectric.**

The classical vector properties of the angular momentum of a gyroscope are analogous to many of the important
characteristics of the
vector properties of the mechanical magnetic inertia. The reason for the close analogy is due to the important and
critical connection
between the dielectric inertial plane and the angular momentum due to the dielectric’s acceleration, or spin. For
example, the rotating
mass of a gyroscope possesses angular momentum, which can be represented by a vector whose direction is along the
symmetry axis
of rotation. A gyroscope in a field precesses, i.e., the axis of its rotation precesses around the direction of the
counterspatial field.
What factors determine the rate of precession of the gyroscope? The answer is the field force at the center of rotation
and the inherent
angular momentum of the gyroscope, or in this case the dielectric plane and its acceleration. If the angular momentum,
which is
determined by the angular velocity of spin and the mass of the gyroscope, is constant, the rate of precession ω is
determined only by
the centripetal field force, so that there is a proportionality between the rate of precession and the centripetal field
force, where γ
(compare to the magnetogyric ratio) is the scalar proportionality constant between the precessional frequency and the
centripetal field
force**. ω (Larmor frequency) = γeH**

Discovery: Magnetism does and must (as do all fields) reciprocate along the lowest pressure gradients out and thru and
back again.
It cannot be any other way. Without looking for it or expecting to find same, it turns out that all magnetic stable
centrifugal and
centripetal vortex lines radiate and reciprocate in a pattern identical to the sunflower and other growth organizations
at 137.52788
degrees. Magnetic pressure follows lines of **360(degrees) /85 degrees = 4.23606 degrees** , of which the golden circle
of centrifugal
and centripetal vortexes both move is; **360(degrees) x Phi^-3 = 85 degrees** , and likewise move at **360(degrees) x
Phi^-2 = 137.5077**
degrees. 85 is to Phi as Phi is to 1, additionally 137.5077 is Phi, at which the movements are at **360/85 (=Phi cubed).
** The dielectric
radial centripetal accretion disk of the inertial plane is narrower in reality than 36 only due to intervening magnetic
pressure gradients.
Its ideal geometry however extends out to 36 degrees, nevertheless however the golden ratio proportions are kept
throughout.

**What is a magnet & magnetism, really?**

_"I have found great difficulty in conceiving of the existence of vortices in a medium, side by side, revolving in the
same direction about
parallel axes. The_ **_contiguous portions of consecutive vortices must be moving in opposite directions_** _; and it is
difficult to understand
how the motion of one part of the medium can coexist with, and even produce, an opposite motion of a part in contact
with it. In (a
mechanical) mechanism, when two wheels are intended to revolve in the same direction, a wheel is placed between them so
as to be in
gear with both, and this wheel is called an 'idle wheel'. The hypothesis about the vortices which I have to suggest is
that a layer of
particles, acting as idle wheels, is interposed between each vortex and the next, so that each vortex has a tendency to
make the
neighboring vortices revolve in the same direction."_ **_- James Clerk Maxwell_**

_“Divine? Holy, or unholy? What be this invisible force, this magnetism that can pull iron from the other side of my
hand with no care
or notice of same?”_ **_– old poem_**

_“Magnetism is the dielectric field”_ **_– Michael Faraday_**

_“Magnetism is the discharge Ether modality of dielectricity in termination. Dielectricity is counterspatial, magnetism
is spatial. All
radiation, all discharges in the universe are spatial by nature and definition. Magnetism, therefore is the necessitated
polarized
(creates space) co-eternal conjugate to dielectricity. Electricity terminates AS magnetism , not INTO magnetism, by
losing its
dielectric component as necessitated; electricity is the product of Phi (magnetism) and Psi (dielectricity), is
definitionally a hybrid
Ether modality of the product of Phi and Psi.”_ **_– Author_**

_“The supreme irony is that the notion of “electromagnetism” exists at all, which definitionally cannot exist, since
electricity is the
product of electrostatics and magnetism, as meant dielectricity and magnetism_ **_(Φ x Ψ = Q, or electrification)._**
_To say
“electromagnetism” is like saying, “charging-discharge”, or “pregnant baby”; it is insanity. The very term
‘electromagnetism’ is a
compound of two Greek terms,_ **_ἢλεκτρον_** _, electron (amber, which creates, easily, electrostatics charges), and the
term_ **_μαγνήτης_** _,
‘magnetic’, from (μαγνήτης λίθος), which means "magnesian stone", the “magic attractive stone” with natural
macro-magnetic
phenomena. Electricity is a hybrid Ether-modality of Φ x Ψ. Magnetism is the radiative discharge of dielectricity, or
electrification in
discharge at which time it terminates AS magnetism in losing its dielectric component. Pliny states that: ‘in Syria the
women make the
whorls of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of harpax (from ἁρπάζω, "resonate, attract”, same as
the word for
harp musical instrument) from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringes of
tissues.’ As such we
have today the term electromagnetism which is from the terms dielectricity + magnetism, which is what electricity is.
However we
wrongly understand and fail to differentiate magnetism, from dielectricity, and electricity. These three are wholly
separate Ether
modalities and electricity is a hybrid of both magnetism and dielectricity in a circuit working together to create
electricity.“_ **_– Author_**

The format of this and other sections of this article are created in a manner of simplicity in a non-traditional fashion
to keep salient
points isolated from one another. To compact as much pithy information as possible into this article I have serialized
the point-
thoughts to sound bites for simplex digestion and comprehension. Not only has this made proofing the material much
easier, but also
localized thoughts can be expanded and given the attention they are meant to have in this article by their isolation and
unthreaded
formatting style.
What you can and should take away from this article, and magnetism specifically is the extremely simple, but not simplex
nature of
what magnetism is, both in whole and in part, and dispel many of your long held and erroneous convictions about
attraction, repulsion,
how magnetism works and interacts. What generates magnetism, and why its geometry is the way it is, but more importantly
why it
cannot “be any other way” than it is. Nature does not move against itself like a fisherman walking against the stream.
Greater
pressures override lesser ones and conjugate reciprocation is endless in this universe, both in macro and micro. However
the
understanding of this as relates to magnetism and inter-atomic operational vectors and geometry on the electrical and
magnetic is
extremely poorly understood and even worse.

_The ordering of the salient points below is not linear, but, like a magnet, is reciprocating, however if you bear thru
at least half of
this section on magnetism you will understand what a magnet is in full, how it works, why it works, what is the nature
of its magneto-
dielectric field mechanics. So stroll through these points and clarity will unfold as to the nature of magnetism like
you have never seen
it before, but more importantly, most importantly, its accurate unfolding._
The missing component to magnetism is, as will be spelled out, is that magnetism and dielectricity are the two
components of the
universe. Magnetism the spatial (however space is in a field, not the inverse), circulatory, radiative, and polarized
both centrifugal and
centripetal and the dielectric is the inertial, centripetal, counterspatial, and radial; magnetic spatial radiation, and
dielectric generation,
or inertia. Understanding this conjugate relationship of magneto-dielectricity is a fundamental mandatory principle to
grasping
magnetism and the nature of how electrification operates in the creation of a magnet, and that a magnet can then be seen
for what it
really is; and as it pertains to how humans throughout all of history have looked at a “magnet”, has really been looking
at a horse’s
rear without ever having seen its head. However almost all of us have labored under this delusion for all our lives,
been taught same,
and all of us are at fault. By “standing on the shoulders of giants, I have seen much further”, so I give great credit
for some of the
“missing keys” to this mystery to J.C. Maxwell, C.P. Steinmetz, Tesla especially, Oliver Heaviside and a few others. As
Eric Dollard
himself has stated, this ‘quantum mysticism’ of insanity and nonsense as espoused by Einstein and his priests has run
over rationality
and common sense. Nature does not operate irrationally and quantum is, thanks to many brilliant minds, dying quickly.
The revival of
rational physics and understanding is returning after a century of “deep thinking insanity”.

Magnets are not magnetized objects, they’re electrified into dielectric coherency at the inter-atomic, the resultant
magnetization is
merely the byproduct of electrical saturation in the ferrous material of a specific nature (iron, or
Neodymium-Iron-Boron or
otherwise), which allows a permanent (in the case of a permanent magnet) macro-magnetic effect to remain in place. All
magnets are
by their nature electrical-dielectric-magnetic atomic geometries, either permanent or as temporary fields induced in
electromagnets.

Electrification of a pre-“magnet” literally ‘winds the mainspring’ of dielectricity, which rolls the ‘hands’ of
magnetism along in a
reciprocating vortex. However unlike our watch, which eventually unwinds its mainspring, the permanent magnet has a (
almost)
perpetually unwinding-self-winding mainspring. How can it self-wind while at the same time unwinding? Because of the
nucleal
dynamo nature of the “magnet” mass at the atomic level remains in place which winds all atoms in nature for what to
humans seems a
perdurable eternity, however merely a blink in the eye of nature obviously. This is part and parcel of the
magneto-dielectric ‘elasticity’
of iron and iron composites (neodymium iron boron) which can be, as pertains to their respective fields, squeezed
intensely and hold
that field shape. In the case of the “magnet”, in its creation it is, like a clay sphere, squeezed around its equator
into a choke point
where you have a resultant hourglass, or dumbbell shape (see multiple diagrams and proofs below) with the choke point
being the
immense dielectric inertial plane and likewise the spatial hyperbolas being the magnetic after-effects from the
electrification.

A magnet is, in reality, a magneto-radiative mass due to A: magneto-dielectric ‘elasticity’ of ferrous materials B:
electrification of the
ferrous mass which causes greatly increased dielectric capacitance and macro-magnetic preponderances. Magnetism itself
is the inter-
spatial circular atomic medium (Ether), which mediates between the atomic charges and dielectric capacitance of the
atomic volume.
Electrification causes a unique (very common however in nature, as proven below) magneto-dielectric geometry to form (
see diagrams
below), as must be the case since magnetism is spatial and the increased magnetic induction can no longer be contained
within the
inter-atomic volume (in equilibrium). This special geometry works as a unified field in a coherent conjugate phase to
create a
magnetic double-hyperbola as resultant from dielectric amplification, as meant capacitance of the magnetic mass which
has been
electrified (see diagrams below). Conventionally we humans consider this ‘action at a distance’ spatial-counterspatial
geometry of
reciprocating magnetism as unique, however it is incredibly common (proven below) but uncommon to exist outside of the
inter-
atomic geometry in such a ‘powerful’ fashion as we make note of in the permanent magnet which has fascinated humanity
for ages.

**Below: Cube magnet under ferrocell showing magnetic field reciprocations, centripetal and centrifugal.**

The charged mass has elongated the micro-magnetic density away from the atomic equilibrium between its dielectric and
charged
inter-atomic periphery. There are no electrons in or comprising an atom, as has been amply mentioned. Electrification of
a ferrous
mass causes the electrostatic (dielectric) naturally centripetal contraction of the atomic geometry which thereby forces
and amplifies
its repulsed conjugate, magnetism into the macro-magnetic spatial vector thereby by creating a macro-magnetic mass
so-deemed a
“magnet”. All forces exist as a counter-spatial pressure gradient, as per the Ether.

Nature only moves in spirals, never in a linear fashion, as necessitated by the null-fulcrum of action-reaction,
centripetal-centrifugal,
spatial-counterspatial, radiation-generation, clockwise-counterclockwise, circular-radial. All spiral movement is
natural movement
around a fulcrum as against its conjugate. All fields, all charges and discharges are spatial and counterspatially
centripetal or
centrifugal. Linear movements are not voluminous movements, of which therefore spatial and counterspatial movements of
nature are
spiral by nature and necessitated to be same.

Nobody can stretch a rubber band with one finger unless the band was already around a spirally curved finger expanding
and
transferring energy to the band in the expansion, at which time the finger was straightened, the band would fly off at
90 degrees to the
straight finger. A straightening (terminating, discharging) finger induces a conjugate force into appearance. Likewise
with a spiral
spring in a watch unwinding causing perpendicular winding (clockwise) of the watch hands along their reciprocal null
axis, being the
Ether in analogy.

In speaking of “magnetism”, the immediate connotation is that of (N and S) polarity, however this spatial abstraction
does not
exist. Magnetism is but one force itself, however as magnetism is purely spatial in denotation it is polarized but as
one moving Ether
‘sink’ and ‘bubble’; magnetism has but one movement not two, nor ‘two poles’, CW and CCW are spatial abstractions of a
singular
movement of the magnetic field itself. There are no static fields.
The ‘polarized’ conception of magnetic ‘polarity’ is a long held intellectual defect in electro-magnetic geometric
understanding.
Any spatial distention is naturally ‘polarized’ definitionally by distention. A spinning object of any variety appears
to be moving
clockwise from one end, and counterclockwise from the other, however the object is moving in one direction, it has ‘no
concept’ of
poles or polarity, only the ignorant humans scratching their heads have this perceptual defect.

There is no independent magnetism (Ether vortex) flowing thru a magnet like water thru a pasta strainer and looping back
upon itself.
There is no quantitative difference between a pre and post magnet but for its electrification and resultant
electro-qualitative magneto-
dielectric change in attribution as both coherent and macro-magnetic due to iron and iron crystalline compounds (
neodymium iron
boron) magneto-dielectric ‘elasticity’. There are no discrete particles involved in mediating magnetism, no quantum
‘virtual photons’

and other mythical insane abstractions dreamed up by GR and QM. All fields are Ether fields and have nothing to do with
particles or
rays or otherwise. Spatial and counterspatial inductions alone mediate gravity, magnetism, electricity and TEM.

Electricity only occurs at the intersection of the magnetic and the dielectric. Increased electrification of the atomic
geometry and
contraction of the counterspatial dielectric capacitance (increased) is pure atomic electro-dielectric saturation, but
magnetism being a
spatial vector (as implicitly meant polarized, implicative of its movements, CW and CCW) is expelled as macro-magnetism
due to the
electro-dielectric compression of the atomic geometry. Dielectricity being counterspatial is ‘impelled’ with increased
capacitance
within the atomic structure and magnetism ‘expelled’ without. Magnetism dissipates as heat and heat dissipates magnetism
in a
ferrous magnetized mass due to causing atomic expansion and decreasing the capacitance of the atomic ferrous electrical
‘elasticity’ in
its geometry and returning magneto-dielectric equilibrium to within the atomic geometry. As the electric and dielectric
radius is
decreased the increase in magnetism can no longer be contained within the atomic former equilibrium.

Time, Space, Dielectricity, and Magnetism. Only magnetism is a spatial dimension, space is not calculated by space.
Electrification, in
Plancks is the product of magnetism and dielectricity. Only magnetism gives volume to the atomic and likewise volume to
the
dielectric-electric universe. Ignorantly and in error GR and QM have declared 99.9999999% of an atom is “empty space”,
when in
fact not even .00000001% of it is empty, it’s a magneto-dielectric dynamo driven by enormous nucleal rotary spin and
charges.

```
Magnetism: 1. Centrifugal (centripetal on return = polarization) 2. Circular 3. Radiative 4. Spatial
Dielectricity: 1. Centripetal 2. Radial 3. Inertial 4. Counterspatial
```

Non-contact magnetic induction can be easily seen and demonstrated where a magnet close to a piece of steel it will
magnetically
induce that steel and create a temporary ‘magnet’ out of the unmagnetized steel. Contrary to common belief, opposites do
not attract.
Like attracts like, and opposites repel. Dielectricity repels magnetism and vice versa. Magnets do not repel. Pole on
pole repulsion is
like on like Ether spin compression, not repulsion. Polarity is a misunderstanding of spatial CW and CCW spin (see below
for more on
inductive attraction).

The contracted atom from electrification increases dielectricity and expels magnetism. Counterspatial dielectric
contraction due to
electrification necessitates magnetic spatial expulsion. The ferrous material remains stable from electrification with
its magneto-
dielectric elasticity ‘frozen’ in place, but the magnetism is resultantly and by necessity displaced greatly from the
geometric-atomic
structure to be expelled from within the electric-dielectric radius of the atomic geometry. Inter-atomic volume
compression from
increased dielectric capacitance expels macro-magnetism, as must be the case.

Since dielectricity is a counterspatial radial Ether modality, the inertial plane constriction of the inter-atomic
causes, resultant from
electrification, a sharp increase of dielectricity and, atomically, expelled magnetism, which is forced, is expelled
from the atomic
structure. Magnetism is a versor solely of space (being circular, but not IN space, rather has an attributional quality
OF space since a
polarized Ether modality ‘contains space’ but is not in space). After being charged, the atomic mass of the ferrous
material has
increased capacitance and likewise being so induced, increased magnetism but not micro-magnetically rather
macro-magnetically
thereby creating the magnetically charged mass which has been created from electrification. Electrical saturation causes
a distorted
magneto-dielectric geometry and likewise therefore a magneto-spatial geometry to the special ferrous atomic structure
with its unique
magneto-dielectric ‘elasticity’.

The dielectric-magnetic atomic architecture of ferrous materials and compounded ferrous materials (neodymium) has a
specific
induction and capacitance elasticity which allows the creation of permanent magnets to be electrified to create a stable
equilibrium of
macro-magnetic phenomena of a ‘double-sink’ Ether vortex movement as ‘driven’ by the dielectric dominance present within
the
electrified system.

**Below: convention misunderstanding of phase creation in the making of a magnet where it is incorrectly demonstrated
that
“magnetic domains are aligned” and this is therefore how a coherent magnetic field is created. But this is both
illogical and
incorrect. The chain of causation is incorrect 100% in this demonstrably erroneous explanation that currently exists.**

Typically as is the case of the conventional understanding of magnetism, the creation of a magnet is not the ‘aligning
of domains’
however in microscopy this phenomena is seen as validated. The reality is rather that (see diagrams below) the
incommensurability of
self-similarity within any and all magnets in creation creates inertial plane accelerations in every one of the
trillions of atoms making
up the now electrified mass that is a “magnet”. Acting as a single coherent body, the in phase electro-geometric nature
of the new
“magnet” self-centers both the dielectric inertial plane at the spatial middle of the magnet as conjugated against and
maximum
distance between either end of CW or CCW magnetic circulations, or rotations. Then the question remains, ‘how does a
magnet
‘know’ how to self-center the dielectric inertial plane after it has been electrified in the creation of this new
magnet?’
The reason for this dielectric inertial self-centering is due to the conjugate magnetism resultant from electrification
which causes
dielectric capacitance in the iron or iron compound which thereby expels a polarized Ether phenomena that begins
deceleration-
reciprocation at the spatial boundary (centrifugally) of the physical magnet. This inverse spatial-counterspatial
conjugation (never one
without the other as is the case of all forms of magnetism) centers (rather concentrates, since the incommensurability
of the dielectric
is at every ‘point’ along the “magnet”) in phase the dielectric inertial plane at the physical centerline of the magnet
as pressure and
field conjugations are always lowest-pressure seeking ‘mechanisms’. In cannot exist any other way, logically,
electro-geometrically,
and likewise this is evidenced from both experimentation which is undeniable by any, however explanations are lacking by
all, until
now.
The dielectric inertial plane is incommensurate within ANY and ALL magnets, as any child can prove in cutting a magnet
along
the dielectric plane a trillion times (if it was possible) you will have a trillion more magnets with CW and CCW spin on
either side and
in the middle between the two a dielectric inertial plane, a “Bloch wall” in incorrect parlance. However in cutting a
magnet even once
perpendicular to the inertial plane you will not have moved the inertial plane, only bifurcated it in division (not
actual division)
between two new masses.
As is typical (mentioned below in instances) of humanity, we are looking at magnetism upside down and backwards. The
obvious
point of agreement is that pre-electrification, the mass is incoherent omnidirectional and null-cancelling in the
inter-atomic magneto-
dielectric (however none understand this small point) volume; and that post-electrification the magnet is, or has “its
domains in line”,
but what is in line is not magnetic (resultantly it is however, but there are no magnetic ‘domains’ in a magnet, only
the dielectric
inertia and pressures of same from electrification), rather dielectric (as proven time and again by physical magnet
bifurcation and other
Euclidian dissections) in-phase field acceleration (centripetal and radial) by means of amplification.

**Below: Inverted real magnetism image I created of a 1.25” ring magnet on left, top down, thru a ferrocell, likewise on

1” cube neodymium magnet seen edge on along the dielectric inertial plane, with, top and bottom, magnetic polarization
shown as oblong white spots. Notice the obvious hypotrochoid (‘spirograph-like’) pattern seen at the voided center (and
along
the outside rim) of the ring magnet on left. This is will be explained further on in great detail, along with the
formula I
discovered for magnetic reciprocation. Notice the straight bright blue (in this inverted image) line on the cube magnet
on the
right, this is the dielectric inertial plane concentrated and focused at (not located at!) the mid-point between
polarization as is
necessitated by the incommensurate point non-specific conjugate magneto-dielectricity in this coherent system humans
incorrectly call a “magnet”, which in fact is a coherent dielectric object with resultant magnetic radiation, or as
Faraday
called magnetism: “the dielectric field”. Regards to Timm A. Vanderelli, inventor of the ferrocell: two optical-grade
glass
elements between which is an incredibly thin layer of ferrofluid thru which light is passed and magnetically warped to
demonstrate reciprocating magnetism, both divergent and convergent.**

It is not the case to think that one has created in electrification, a “dielectric or magnetic laser (coherent phasing)”
per-se (however
analogously this is rather accurate) rather it is the case that the self-aligning incommensurability of conjugate field
geometry is
necessitated, logical, and cannot exist in any other manner, likewise this ordering (see further down below diagrams and
explanations)
is identical to AC line magneto-dielectric geometry. Seeing things incorrectly from the side of magnetism “being made
coherent or
aligned” in creating a “magnet” is incorrect, the resultant is accurate, but the chain of causation is utterly in error.
We might say, in a perfect analogy that taking 5 toy gyroscopes and spinning them up, before which they lay in a
variegated
manner with their respective axles and felly-inertial hubs/rims pointing in various directions representing the
pre-‘magnet’ mass
(however as is the case of the interatomic these ‘gyroscopes’ [not literally of course] of magneto-dielectric volumes
are ever-moving
but ARE IN inter-atomic equalization in lowest-pressure states [unless of course it’s a naturally occurring loadstone]);
that in spinning
these gyroscopes up they will all stand on end with their respective axles all pointing in the same direction. These
axles of course
represent the Z-axis spatially expanding and reciprocating polarized magnetism, and the driver, the impetus for all of
this, the
gyroscopic flywheel, the true ‘heavyweight’ (in more ways than one) is the dielectric inertial plane which has been spun
up (in
capacitance) from electrification.
Now, in a toy gyroscope, the flywheel is attached to the axle and one spins up the axle first, however the professional
larger
gyroscopes are spun up by the flywheel only, which is the correct analogy of the creation of a “magnet”. A magnet is not
a magnet; it
is a dielectric object (explained in full below) with conjugated magnetism resultantly in the chain of
magneto-dielectric causation,
dielectricity (in every way explained further on) is prima causa, naturally, rationally, and absolutely undeniably so,
however obviously
co-eternal conjugate principles resultantly in electrification; where there is one there is the other (only in the case
of the permanent
magnet and other AC / DC phenomena). However in the magneto-dielectric gyroscopic analogy, the axle and flywheel never
meet at
their intersection points. Coherent phasing in the creation of a magnet by accelerating (by capacitance) the dielectric
inertial plane
necessitates both dielectric and magnetic pressure gradient phasing, self-centering and circular polarized magnetic
reciprocation in the
electrified mass.
So how do trillions and trillions of atoms in the mass of the ‘magnet’ self-align their magneto-dielectric fields? The
same way 5
autonomous gyroscopes having been spun up align their flywheels in perfect synchronous manners and their axles likewise;
X,Y, and
Z axis points between magneto-dielectricity in the creation of a magnet align by pressure gradients and
dielectro-inertial gradients the
same way our gyroscopes analogy lines up all three axis point vectors. The true and ONLY power in both the gyroscope
model and

the model of the ‘magnet’ is the flywheel, which is 90% of the weight of a gyroscope, and 90% of the power in any and
every
“magnet” ever created. Now one begs to ask, if a magnet is 90% dielectricity, why do we call it a “magnet”? Very simple,
dielectricity
is counterspatial, is centripetal, is inertial and does not act on (most) other phenomena, the resultant magnetism
however IS spatial, IS
centrifugal (and centripetal), IS radiative, and IS polarized. Likewise children only see the puppet (magnetism) and
never the
puppeteer (dielectricity). There is no (almost none) power in the axle, as meant the magnetism, it is the expulsion of
magnetism
resultant from the cosmic model of the magneto-dielectric binding-system conjugation (see far below for diagrams and
explanations).
As is the case (explained below), a true “magnet” is a dielectric object, whereas a ‘magnetized’ object (steel being
magnetically
induced) is a magnetically dominant object such that it is merely magnetically induced to temporary magnetization by
attribute of its
induction within the magnetic field in proximity to it; but it is not an over-pressure dielectrically capacitant object
such that it is not,
has not been electrified, only magnetically induced from proximal magnetization by the genuine “magnet” (dielectric
dominant mass,
or “magnet”). In the case of magnetization vs. electrification (true “magnet”), proximal magnetic induction aligns the
dielectricity to
cause phase coherency of the magnetism, but this temporary magnetization is the reactance of the dielectricity to the
coherent
magnetic field induction within the non-electrified iron mass. Likewise this dielectric reaction from the field
induction of the genuine
“magnet” causes necessitated reciprocation, or polarized magnetization to appear only so long as the field of induction
from the
“magnet” to the “magnetically-induced” (magnetized) iron or ferrous object, is present. Field incommensurability is
inescapable; that
the iron becomes magnetized resultant to magneto-dielectric pressure-gradient alignments is necessitated.
**However here is where our gyroscopes analogy ends,** since in the genuine model of magnetic induction, merely bringing
a
“dead” gyroscope in proximity to the 5 spinning gyroscopes would cause the “dead” one to spin up and align its Z-axis of
magnetism
likewise to the other 5, but remove it from the proximity of the other 5, and it would ‘stop’ immediately without any
slowdown
process between its pre-state and its induced-state of velocity. This is field pressure equalization. This is
particle-free induction; this is
magnetic induction without electrification (in the creation of a permanent “magnet”). This absolute of field induction
phenomena is
something Tesla understood and which is why future inventions CAN and WILL be made that can have an immediate dump of
momentum without any resultant end harmonic, or resultant inertia. Imagine going from 100 to 0 without the slightest
forward
momentum.
Countless applications and inventions will unfold from the capacity to dump enormous field inductions in termination
with zero
effects. This inertial momentum of induction is mediated solely by spatial, or polarized field proximities, not inherent
to the system or
subject being induced, likewise induction termination in this case is non-local and therefore the effects are as well.
However the inertia
(forward momentum) of mass has its own field termination in which momentum can be instantly dumped with no resultant
effects on
the subject, from a non-local inductive source, but that is a subject for another article I will not discuss here.

**Below: Left, stationary ‘pre-electrification’ gyroscopes with their ‘magnetic’ (red, axles) polarizations and
‘dielectric’ (blue,
the flywheel of inertia) inertial planes within inter-atomic equilibrium; however in the model of the atom, our magneto-
dielectric ‘gyros’ are ever spinning, but in equilibrium within the inter-atomic, but out of phase (in demonstrable
quantities)
in magneto-dielectric incommensurability in the macro because their dielectric capacitance hasn’t been radically
increased
from electrification yet. On the right is post-electrification (the “magnet”), though all 5 are autonomous, the XYZ
phase
ordering in self-similar incommensurability has occurred due to inertial acceleration of the ‘flywheel’ (the
dielectric). This
amplified by many trillions of atoms creates a magneto-dielectric self-similarity of field phasing along field pressure
gradients
to make a singular unified whole, or “magnet” with its dielectric inertial planes and reciprocating ‘axial’ circulating
magnetic
polarization movements. The gyroscopes of course are not literal, rather a near-perfect analogy of interatomic magneto-
dielectric phenomena in pre and post electrification states.
This phenomena, undeniable, I have coined as: “Field Incommensurability”, or F.I. (Incommensurable: not having conjugate
units of or in the same dimension, substantively immaterial and the Ether in basis. In magneto-dielectricity, one field
is
spatially additive, the other counterspatially multiplicative in inertial velocity). This is the magneto-diaelectric
binary
consubstantial conjugate system inherent to all inter-atomic operations and to the pre and post-electrification in a
“magnet”.**

In understanding this dielectric inertial plane I have already written 20 bits of data to a magnetized subject and
reproduced the results,
by means I will not explain here. However the implications of this means writing data on another plane rather than
merely along the
XY spinning surface of a magnetic hard drive platter. Additionally I am 100% certain that data can be written between
two ferro-
magnetic surface planes where dual platter disks can, conjugately, create data fields in the vacuum spaces between the
two ferrous
platters at which the data exists in a free space vacuum to be read by induction readers of conjugate magneto-dielectric
field gradients.
Incommensurate compounding and self-similarity likewise has implication with near-100% certainty, that data storage
devices can be
increased to the 100+ terabyte range in a likewise 9.5mm hard drive currently with a max capacity of 1.5 terabytes.

Attraction by a magnetic mass to a non-magnetized piece of iron is created by an Ether-vacuum vortex, which naturally
tends itself
towards equalization between the iron and the magnet. In presence of the Ether-magnetic field there is dielectric
contraction in the
unmagnetized mass which, since dielectricity is counterspatial, means there is inter-atomic dilation pertaining to
magneto-attractive
vacuum dilation. In shrinking the dielectricity in the atom, as it rebounds in opposition to the magnetic field, it
dilates the magneto-
atomic volume causing magneto-Etheric ‘attraction’ (via induction and towards self-voidance of polarization) to the
magnet which is
only a simplex pressure gradient equalization. Magnetism always seeks geometric/spatial equilibrium, as do all fields.
The magneto-
negative pressures created in the atomic dilation of the non-magnetized mass is being ‘filled’ by the field gradient of
the magnet.
This is a self-seeking dielectric equilibrium however in its root. Just as two magnets of inverse spin being brought
together will
form a perfect spherical field before mating (which is a centripetal dielectric gravitative-like attributional inertia
equalization), the iron
or other ferrous mass is a pressure-equalization seeking between the “magnet” and the stable iron. The field of magnetic
induction
from the magnet to the iron causes acceleration of the iron TO the magnet (the dielectric-electrified mass) due to
now-imbalanced
field pressures in the iron. Action at a distance (all forms) are field pressure equalization-seeking sinks.
Acceleration of the iron TO
the magnet is resultant from creating a centripetal inertial vortex by means of magnetic induction, in the iron as
flowing towards the
magnet, which is both how and why iron will ‘leap’ to a magnet. There are no particles mediating this (as espoused by
Atomists and
GR and QM), only field pressures. Every gram of matter in the universe, ferrous or otherwise is sitting in its own (
temporary)
equilibrium, either in a gravity field, or a magnetic field, or a dielectric field. As a crude analogy, in bringing a
magnet near an iron
nail for example is a ‘gravity field’ (analogously only as meant) towards which the iron must ‘fall’, however this is
just a negative
pressure acceleration of one to the other, and the ‘gravity’ in this case is dielectric, as existing dominantly in the
“magnet” and as
conjugately induced in the inverse, magnetically, in the iron by which the iron being “magnetically induced” is merely
the effect of the
magnetic induction from the “magnet” causing dielectric constriction in the iron nail which thereby causes magnetic
dilation in the
same nail and therefore acceleration of the nail to the “magnet” which is the dielectric electrified mass with a
dominant dielectric
charge. Induction acceleration of the iron to the permanent (or electromagnet) is purely field alignment by means of
F.I. (field
incommensurability), within which all pressures are necessitated to follow field gradient parameters of self-similarity.
The “magnet” is out of equilibrium, in short, with a strong dielectric charge, and resultantly to this a strong magnetic
attribute to
the so-called “magnet”; as such the magnetic Ether ‘bubble’ creates magneto-dielectric pressure imbalances in other
sympathetic
ferrous structures (and non-ferrous at greater powers) materials which force their acceleration towards those objects
out of
equilibrium. Nobody understands that all matter is a balance of field pressure gradients, and throwing one object
greatly out of balance
, even if stable, due to irons magneto-dielectric ‘elasticity’ is but one very lucid example, with an extremely unclear
understanding by
most peoples. This conjugate causation is not understood by modern science, however science is certain it understands
magnetic
induction, however only very superficially so at best (and unfortunately with materialistic insane explanations). This
at-rest
acceleration of the iron towards the magnet is of course due to magnetic induction, but is sourced firstly in the
dielectric, and of course
all fields are Ether in nature; as such an Ether vacuum sink (field incommensurability) is created between the magnet
and the nail
which forces acceleration of the later towards the former. All matter has its decelerant, and likewise has an
accelerant. Dielectric,
magnetic, gravitational, centripetal or spatial or counterspatial. Conjugate perfection exists in nature, one spatial,
the other
counterspatial, at which pressure gradients dance around a fulcrum of action-reaction.
As is the case between the “magnet” and the nail when ‘together’, whereas the nail is magnetized (magnetically induced),
the
“magnet” is dielectrically saturated from electrification. Inverse to general understanding, the non-“magnet” nail is
the magnetic
object (temporarily) and that which we call the “magnet” is in fact the dielectric object with secondary attributional
magnetism as a
resultant from the process in its creation.
Magnetism does not operate by centrifugal movement alone because, while magnetism is definitionally polarized, it moves
as
pressure dictates it must; its centripetal movement is governed by dielectric inertial pressures of the Ether in
self-seeking equilibrium
out of space and time back to the counterspatial. Counterspace definitionally is the 0-point fulcrum from which all
fields are manifest,
either atrributionally as polarized in magnetism, or centripetally and radially as in dielectricity, or in stable
formats as matter itself.
Non-contact electrification in creation between a spatially polarized Ether field (magnetism) and a centripetal magnetic
barrier
(dielectric reflector) is the counterspatial torque from the inertial plane of which 0-point dielectric precession is
caused to torque in
creating electricity perpendicular to the precessional inertial perturbations as forced from repeating magnetic
deflections over a given
time. This is the Planck in creation. One prime mover must overpower the prime inertia for electrification to occur.
That prime inertia
is counterspace, is the dielectric inertial plane, or membrane for field phenomena to manifest and interact.

**Below: Cross sectional side view of a magnet, its dielectric plane, with centrifugal and centripetal circular
polarization.**

It is said that space or nature “abhors a vacuum” but this is untrue, it is the Ether that abhors a vacuum of itself;
micro-magnetic, as
meant atomic dilation is filled by the magnetic, or Ether-field, there is no void inside the atom as GR and QM profess.
There is no
Ether in space, only space; counterspace is the opposite of space. Ether disturbances can be brought into space, such as
magnetism,
mass, gravity, electricity, dielectricity, but all lines of force terminate in counterspace, not in space, as such Ether
terminates in Ether.
That polarized spatial Ether fields exist is, as always can be found, against-space, not in space. A spatial disturbance
is really an Ether
field disturbance, either radial, polarized / circular, longitudinal, centrifugal or centripetal. Space has only 1
dimension, space; fields
interact with other fields in different modalities of pressure stability.
All atomic bindings are Ether and Ether equalizes itself with itself, conjugately by dielectricity or by magnetism in
the
counterspatial and in the spatial, or in dynamic polarization by the production of electricity. To speak conventionally
as humans are
necessitated, we say magnetism is spatial, however this is empirically just a connotation, what we are detonating is
that a field is
polarized (rather distended as space, not against space or ‘in’ space, since this is impossible) against itself (from
another causation
namely dielectricity), but not OF space. As mentioned, polarization is a trick of space in seeing CW on one end (in
space) and CCW
from the other end (in space). There is space in Ether when the Ether is in dynamic movements, centripetal or
centrifugal, radial or
circular, but the Ether is not in space, the Ether is only in itself as it equalizes itself with, by, in and thru itself
with itself, the space
created from this dynamic is merely an attributional convention. As is the case, there is ‘gold in the gold lion, but no
lion in the gold’.

Any polarization of the Ether must be dielectro-electromagnetic, dielectrically terminating (as mass), or magnetic by
definition.
Electrostatics, longitudinal and dielectricity being counterspatial and without polarity cannot partake of polarity and
likewise also not
partake of space or time. Spatial accumulation of mass however is a different modality with a centripetal field, but a
spatial
accumulation of matter.

**Below: True view of magnetism divergence and convergence, centrifugal and centripetal. Likewise that which drives and
is the
Ether modality behind all magnetism, dielectricity. Magnetism is the ‘dielectric field’, is dielectricity in discharge,
the
radiation of same. A ‘magnet’ in a manner of speaking is a short circuit of coherent dielectric point non-specific
self-similarity;
in perfect magneto-dielectric field conjugation, as created from increased capacitance or coherent induction from
another
source without an increase in dielectric capacitance.**

A magnet is an electrified piece of iron into which a strong generative dielectric current has been caused to circulate
such that the
trillions of atomic pumps, which make up the magnet have been manipulated. The electrification is so great that the
magnetic outflow
is like a speeding rapid in comparison with its normal flow. The axial poles of rotation and the magnetic poles have
become almost
superimposed, the potential and unit pressures gradients have been amplified to such an extent that another piece of
iron of normal
(equalized) potentials and pressures are drawn into the higher pressure of the "magnetized" iron, and its potential also
raised, i.e.
magnetic induction.

**Below: Magnetic putty and a 1cm cubed neodymium magnet. The magnet (rather the dielectric) will self-center itself in
the
middle of the mass of putty, regardless of shape or size. Once entering the putty, the putty will form a sphere around
the
magnet, regardless of the shape of the magnet (of course). Amusingly, it slowly looks like the putty is inhaling the
magnet like
a creature eating an object, however it is the case that the “magnet” is self-centering the magnetic induction fields in
and of the
putty which is a viscous ferro-magnetic suspension.**

There is no attraction vs. repulsion in a magnetic field, all so-called attraction is driven by the dielectric, only the
spin of the
circulatory field planes of the magnetism. Positive charge attracts positive charge and expels negative discharge in an
electrified
magnet. Negative discharges repels both negative discharges and positive charges. **The fact that dielectricity expels
magnetism does
not mean that it repels it.** The expulsion of magnetism is not the repulsion of magnetism. This is the
magneto-dielectricity of
conjugate field incommensurability.

The product of magnetism united with dielectricity gives rise to the total electrification of the Ether. Psi times Phi
=electrification. (Ψ
x Φ = Q); meaning that electrification gives rise to dielectric saturation of the atomic geometry, and strains the Ether
in a “magnet”
due to the magneto-dielectric atomic ‘elasticity’ or malleability of iron. Dielectric and electric charges give rise
to (increased)
magnetism. The inverse of electrification is utter voidance, as terminated into magnetism, pure polarized radiation.
Electricity
terminates in magnetism, as a polarized radiation, but terminates in same only thru the dielectric. All appearances of
magnetism as
terminating from electricity, has a dielectric locus or intermediary causative agent in principal, in the atomic, in a
“magnet”, or even in
a galactic jet.

**Below: Top down view of magnetic velocity on a cylinder magnet.**

Expulsion is the result of electric attraction which causes the electrically charged counterspatial dielectric to draw
closer together
and distort the micro-magnetic atomic geometry out of equilibrium. This effect of closer assemblage is a centripetal
effect of
contraction which squeezes magnetism away from the spaces between the integrating particles of electric preponderance. A
high
charge = high sink/bubble vortex (in discharge) of magnetism. A high magnetism in motion over time = charge as against a
dielectric
conductor, as meant a magnetic reflector.
A dielectric reflector (deflects magnetism, but in stress from precessional magnetic movements is caused to create
radial
electrification) is the very same which conducts the dielectricity around which the electromagnetism reciprocates.
Electricity and
circular magnetism exists radially around and down between the AC conducting lines, but the radial dielectric exists
radially thru the
dielectric conductor (magnetic reflector. A reflector which is dominantly dielectric [silver, copper, etc.] or as meant
a magnetic
reflector which causes dielectric precession, or torque) operates centripetally, (in attraction) between the lines.

A reflector material, or element which is dominantly dielectric is a magnetic reflector. The ‘dielectric reflector’
nature of the dielectric
medium is its resistance to magnetism and likewise production of electrification, by its precessional dielectric torque
resultant from
magnetic fields against same over time. The prime mover of the magnetic field, over time, induces precession against the
dielectric
medium, in its inertial plane torque, to induce electrical phenomena. It must be understood that the “dielectric
reflector” isn’t meant
that it is reflecting dielectricity, rather reflecting against magnetism by nature of it being dielectric in medium,
such that it should be
called a reflector of a dielectric medium which reflects (resists) magnetic field movements.

**Below: A more elaborate view of dielectric and magnetic field dynamics of a so-called “magnet” which is, in reality, a
dielectric coherent object. “Aligned domains” is a misnomer, the truth of the matter is that magnetism is a resultant of
coherent inter-atomic dielectricity aligned to yield resultant polarized magnetic reciprocations.**

The only difference between AC lines and TEM (dielectro-electromagnetism) is that in AC current the electricity is
flowing radially at
the intersection of the dielectric and magnetic between the lines, whereas in TEM, where there is no Z-axis physical
conductor, the
magnetism and electricity are reciprocating along the XY-axis as thru and against the Z-axis radial dielectric element
of TEM.

**Below: showing mutual fields views of magnetism and dielectricity as separated out showing necessitated pressure
conjugation. These will shift at breaks, or if a magnet were to be sliced against its dielectric inertial plane. All
magnets have
point non-specific self-similarity at every portion or part of the “magnet”. This is the Wheeler Principle of magnetic
field
incommensurability. Absolute grasp of this principle is necessary for any understanding of how a magnet works to occur.
**

The dielectric inertial plane has its null-axle or fulcrum in the space between the AC lines and its inertia plane
radius is running radial
thru and down the both AC lines, whereas in TEM the dielectric is running radially along the Z-axis with both its
inertial plane and
axle in superimposition however pulsed radially in distention and contraction as electromagnetism reciprocates around
and against the
Z-axis dielectric. Counterspatial capacitance without a physical conductor is nature’s perfect XYZ
spatial-counterspatial geometry of
TEM; here is wireless transmission of immense power, nature’s way.

**Below: AC transmission lines, looking end-on. In simplex, when magnetism is the expanding Z-axis spatial ‘axle’ the
dielectric
inertial plane is distended as the disk; and when dielectricity is the Z-axis radial, then magnetism becomes the XY-axis
circular spatial reciprocating torus, or ‘disk’. At no time however is the dielectric circular, only radial and seeking
the smallest
space. This is the premise of dielectricity being generative and magnetism being radiative, terminal. Far right is an AC
circuit.**

The never before understood reason that higher gauss rated permanents magnets have a much more shallow field geometry
yet higher
gauss ratings is due to the logical fact that the Ether vortex velocity is higher in conjunction with the higher gauss
ratings. As any
vortex climbs in spiral velocity its radius decreases in step. This is the very same reason why extremely highly gaussed
stacked
magnets which come to an apex, while having high gauss readings up to 1.5+ Tesla; these same fields are extremely
shallow and do
not extend beyond the surface more than a fraction of a centimeter. Field ratings fall off at distance in direct
proportional relation to

the vortex Ether velocities of the magnet. Since the magnetic field is a double reciprocating vortex, the higher the
apex velocities due
to higher gauss rating, likewise the more shallow the cone is allowed to extend from the magnets surface. This
conjugated reversion
causes significant shortening of both vertical axial lengths of the N and S vortex.

The coherency of the charge coupled with the macro-magnetic electrification of the ferrous mass at the atomic level has
created a
permanent Ether-vortex of magnetism, a sink-bubble phenomena that will, under ideal circumstances, last nearly in
perpetuity under
ideal conditions.

The negative terminals, as meant the discharge-planes or dielectric are counterspatial and terminate into spatial
magnetic phenomena;
in magnetization there is inter-atomic nucleal-charge and discharge-plane contraction from the increased electrostatic
capacitance
(dielectric) and expulsion of the magnetic. Dielectric saturation causes magnetism to increase, as the two are mutually
repellant
conjugates and both approach higher spatial and counterspatial inductances.

**Below: Relative mutual magnetic field reciprocation on any magnet. Distinction must be made between inside to outside
polarization, versus face-down polarization, also all movements are relative to the other poles mutual divergence and
convergence.**

Dielectricity is counterspatial and magnetism is spatial, one counterspatial electrostatic, and magnetism circular,
spatial and polarized.
Electric discharges terminate into the polarized magnetic spatial by way of a dielectric locus. Charge polarization or
field polarization
movements of and between space and time is the fulcrum of ever balancing equilibrium in which the cosmos functions.

Wherever there is one, it is due to the appearance of the other, magnetism is induced into existence, or inversely, the
dielectric is
induced into existence by magnetism over time from a prime mover. However to induce dielectricity requires a polarized
field to
move its polarization or separate its polarization over time from a prior prime mover; but to induce magnetism into
existence,
electricity must merely terminate into a dielectric inter-atomic medium, or locus.

Depending on the atomic and spatial geometry, electrical discharges (Ether polarization) can terminate (discharge) in
counterspatial
dielectric capacitance or terminate (discharge) in spatial magnetic inductance. The charge-plane (nucleus) of
electricity and magnetism
are spatial such that both are polarizations of the Ether and have dimensionality and a gravitative component with its
locus in the
dielectric. Not mentioned here are some of Tesla’s dielectric longitudinal waves that do not have a conjugate magnetic
component.

That the dielectric terminal in counterspace is necessitated to be capacitance and that magnetism’s terminal of space is
necessitated to
be polarized inductive motion are self-reinforcing definitional absolutes, such that any discharge into a spatial medium
terminal must
be both polarized Ether movement and magnetic induction by definition and any discharge into a dielectric medium of
counterspace

itself must be both capacitance and create a counterspatial dielectric momentum and tend towards spatial contraction as
is the nature of
dielectricity to be multiplicative in –space and magnetism to be naturally additive in +time.

Magnetism is additive in +time and multiplicative in + space, and dielectricity additive in –time (no-time, not reverse
time), and
multiplicative in –space (counterspace).

**Below: Each end of the magneto-dielectric hyperboloid, or polarized pole (N and S) has inverse relative (emphasis!)
divergence
(convergence) and likewise inverse relative (emphasis!) convergence (centripetal). All divergent and convergent
reciprocations
and likewise gyromagnetic precessions naturally follow golden ratio proportionality both in whole and in part.**

Magnetism’s discharge plane (over time and space as moved or self-reciprocating) is counterspatial. Magnetism’s
inductive charging
plane is voluminous, is spatial. Dielectricity’s discharging plane is spatial, is degenerative in increasing volume.
Dielectricity’s
charging plane is counterspatial, is accumulatively greater in decreasing spatial volume. Spatial movements are of a
discharging and
charging nature; magnetism is degenerative, is radiative and the expulsion of electricity and dielectric discharges
spatially. Electricity
discharges or terminates into the magnetic plane by way of the dielectric. Electrification is formed out of the
dielectric counterspatial
and magnetic spatial planes. Magnetism is literally the polarized spatial ‘breaks’ upon which the universe is
self-regulating.

Anytime throughout this work I make a reference to “in space” or polarized “in space”, this is merely a convention of
speaking, since
all fields are not IN space, rather there is space within a field, but not the inverse.

Every appearance of magnetism in the macro, or extra-atomic volume, has a reactive recoil wrongly conceived of as a
conjugated
pole, however this is not the case as the dipole nature of magnetism is a spatial abstraction. Its appearance is both an
action and recoil
from the inter-atomic counterspatial dielectric capacitance resultant from a magnets creation in electrification of a
ferrous or quasi-
ferrous (neodymium composite or otherwise) mass.

Graphite over S will be thrown off CCW, and CW off the N, however in any movement over the end planes (‘poles’) surface
of the
magnet with cause the graphite to be spun opposite the movement of travel such that the vortex CW or CCW is still a
magnetic vortex
and the graphite is diamagnetic in its supra-dielectric nature to be magnetically repulsed in any movement contrary to
the direction of
travel.

Pyrolytic graphite is diamagnetic, as means is supra-dielectric in its nature to be magnetically repulsed In any
movement contrary to
the direction of travel; always inverse to the movement of the graphite piece but always free to be tossed CW off the
‘North’ and
CCW off the ‘South’. However of course CW and CCW are conventions of the reification of spatial abstractions that are
reified
unrealities.

Gauss ratings on magnets are a complete misnomer. Gauss is a measure of magnetic vortex velocities, and not a false
abstraction in
wrong definition of a concrete localized dimension of its power, however this velocity or magnetomotive force is in
place as pertains
to magnetic flow velocity induction. Geometric manipulation of a magnets mass from that of a cube into a cone will
greatly increase
the vortex acceleration at the apex of the cone magnet however likewise the field depth will be greatly diminished.
Golden ratio
proportionality between field velocity and geometry must be maintained. Magnetic flux density or induction are misnomers
for the
pressure equalization velocities along magnetic fields as they equalize proportional to the geometry of the
magneto-dielectric mass, or
“magnet”, the levels of dielectric capacitance they have been charged with and the stability of structure in its
manufacture. In the case

of a cone magnet, this creates a dielectric axial torque, which narrows the magnetic field window at the distorted
centrifugal and
centripetal point of reciprocation at both the apex and base of the cone magnet.

**James Clerk Maxwell’s “idle wheel” analogy**

**Below: I only recently came across J.C. Maxwell’s vortex analogy and ‘idler gear’ comparison, which mirrored mine,
except
J.C. Maxwell did not grasp that, unlike a mechanical idler gear which plays only a passive-effective interactive part in
movement, the dielectric inertial plane, or ‘idler’ gear is the actual mover, the driver, so to speak. As is
necessarily, logically,
and absolutely the case to which dielectricity is by nature, being inertial, counterspatial, and creating magnetism as
an Ether-
modality in the discharge of itself. Also unfortunately J.C. Maxwell, while a strong supporter of the Ether, makes an
Atomistic
comparison of the “idler” gear of vortex reciprocation.**

**Below: On left redrawn correct (crude analogy) premise of dielectricity as the inertial driver (inverse to mechanical
‘idler’
gears). Middle and right are mechanical idle gears which mediation a passive-interactive role in movement and mechanical
reciprocations.**

**Below: My discovery and formula for magnetic reciprocation given a perfect situation. To add to J.C. Maxwell’s
analogy, as I
have discovered, that unlike machines, the “idler wheel” of what is ‘driving magnetism’ is the stationary inertial
dielectric
which is the prima causa, the Prime Mover of magnetic reciprocations; just the inverse to a mechanical ‘idler gear’.
This is the
fundamental nature of dielectricity being the ‘electrical inertia’, and fundamental Ether-modality from which the other
3 are
derived.**

Magnetism is the spatial ‘recoil’ of electricity in termination, but is not the conjugate of electricity as conceived
predominately as
‘electromagnetism’. Electricity’s conjugate is the discharging plane in the magneto-dielectric inter-atomic, not
magnetism directly,
which is where electricity terminates, but not its conjugate. While electromagnetism is paired with magnetism in the
model of TEM,
this is not an indictment that magnetism is the conjugate to electricity, dielectricity is the conjugate of magnetism as
co-eternal
principles and the mediator for electrification and the medium for electrifications termination into, or as the
Ether-modality we call
magnetism.

There is neither a South nor a North Pole as regards a magnet. A magnet is only ‘polarized’ in the true sense that its
expulsion from
the magneto-diaelectric sphere necessitates the creation of a circumferentially compressed sphere which is a dumbbell
shaped
hourglass of macromagnetic preponderance which turns CCW on the one end ‘south’ and CW on the other end ‘north’. However
the
entire magnetic hourglass is rotating centrifugally in the same direction only inversely so as seen from either end.
Both ‘ends’ are self-
seeking the lowest Ether gradient to sink and return to circumstantial equilibrium (see Moire’ patters further on),
either along the
midway points between center and edge of either ends of the polar surface where they will trace to the Bloch wall (
dielectric inertial
plane) or from higher ejected velocities around the edge-circumferences to the ‘pole’ at 180 degrees to the CW or CCW
vacuum point
to which CW is a vacuum point to CCW and CCW is a vacuum to CW rotation. However even ‘vacuum’ is a convention, what is
really occurring is the voidance of polarity in the fulcrum of null dominance over high-pressure velocities seeking
utter voidance.

**Below: Left, standard bar magnet with iron dust, middle two inverse spin fields accelerating towards a forming
dielectric-
gravitative center. Far right are two likewise spin fields causing deflection; this is mirror membrane Ether deflection,
this is
literally extremely high-pressure space, whereas the middle picture is a negative pressure counterspatial voidance sink.
Since
the center picture is diagraming the Ether returning to counterspace, that picture is showing the formation of the new
dielectric inertial plane between two inverse spin fields and two separate magnets about to become one single magnet.**

The reason false-field-lines (iron filings) trace spheres between N to S or S to N in ‘attraction’ rather than perfect
parallel lines is
because the vacuum seeking equilibrium must trace itself CW to the CCW or CCW to the CW to the Bloch wall (dielectric
inertial
plane) of the lowest preponderance of Ether pressure, however given the nature of a permanent magnet this cycle must be
repeated
endlessly. Direct parallel lines of ‘attraction’ from N to S or S to N (rather CW or CCW, since a magnet has no poles,
only inverse
spatial spins of magnetism) cannot occur since the hourglass shaped Ether bubble travels centrifugally as high pressure
either CCW or
CW and likewise travels centripetally towards low pressures to CCW or CW directed at the null-point fulcrum of the
counterspatial
dielectric inertial plane. No travel from or in return can make contact and must therefore seek equilibrium by
spherically corkscrewing
towards each other with CCW approaching from around the sphere in one direction and CW approaching from around the
sphere in
the opposite direction. The ‘shrinking sphere’ of polarization voidance is then completed.
This shrinking sphere (in approach however) is sourced in the dielectric inertial plane and this cannot be missed, its
importance is
massive. That dielectricity terminates in mass/(and as) gravity is no coincidence. The centripetal gravitational-like
sphere of two
approaching magnetic fields shrinks and compresses as does dielectricity does by its very nature. As mentioned later on,
a magnets
‘desire’ to self fold is enormous; dielectricity seeks its counterspatial homeostasis and CW on CW or CCW on CCW fields
are
polarization against a non-polarized 0-point dielectric seeking like on like for collapse as against its own created
space, which is why
magnets with opposite vortex movements (CW nearing CCW etc.) accelerate towards one another in bringing the dielectric
into
closest homeostasis, or voidance, with its counterspatial nature and capacitance equilibrium which is not spatial but
counterspatial. As
a side note, the “0-point energy” of fictional works has a true basis in reality, it’s the Ether, specifically the
centripetal, counterspatial,
radial, inertial dielectric! This was and is the ‘missing secret’ of Nikola Tesla. Tesla’s main research was in
dielectricity, not
electromagnetism or electricity. Remember again that 90% of the nature of a “magnet” is not magnetism, rather
dielectricity as the
‘flywheel’ driving this macro-magnetic dominance which has fascinated humanity since the dawn of time.

**Below: Two inverse spin examples of approaching magnets creating dielectro-gravitational-like spheres, the centerpoint
at
which they accelerate towards, absolutely identical to gravitational acceleration but much faster. That dielectric
attraction
acts identical to gravity is no coincidence. Dielectricity terminates as mass, and likewise resultant gravity (in super
massive
dielectric systems).**

At the center of every cone and apex of a dipole a magnetic vortex is the lowest pressure gradient and vacuum point for
CW to seek
equilibrium and likewise for CCW, however these vacuum gradients travel centrifugally from both ends around the
circumference
centripetally to the center with the greatest preponderance of low pressure at the center which is why pyrolytic
graphite, a supra-
diamagnetic crystalline substance, will fly away from the center of any magnet which contains the greatest concentration
of centripetal
magnetic velocity from the equilibrium seeking pressure gradients. This is analogous to placing a piece of cork over a
swiftly
emptying drain however in the case of a magnet there is no spatial depression since the depression exists as a ‘drain’
in decreasing
space towards counterspace. While magnetism is purely a spatial phenomena (as space) in circulation, its discharge is
counterspatial.
No lines of force of any field can terminate into space, they can however terminate into counterspace, which is one of
the other main
‘missing secrets’ of Nikola Tesla.

It will be shown that the inversion of two fields occupying the same inter-atomic sphere when a contracting
counterspatial dielectric
field contracts produces a macro-magnetic hourglass or dumbbell shaped inversion in reaction to the spatial
polarization (CW and
CCW), or magnetic vortex. This contracting dielectric sphere against the spatially identical magnetic sphere acts as a
choking
constrictor upon the magnetic expulsion creating a magnetic dumbbell, a double coherent vortex whose counterspatial
discharging
plane is the Bloch wall (incorrect definition of science, it is the dielectric inertial plane) where spatial pressure is
lowest, as achieved
from around the edge of the magnet under low pressure or to the other ‘pole’ under accelerating returning pressures.

The zero-plane of null pressure-curvatures at the Bloch wall (dielectric inertial plane) is the rebounding point, acting
like reflectors for
the Ether bubble as meant the magnetic pressure CW and CCW movements. Electrification creates a micro-magnetic stricture
which is
coherently amplified in the magnetized mass where the illusion of polarity is magnified as reciprocating vortexes
emanating from the
their “poles”. Equilibrium seeking Ether gradients are mistakenly deemed “magnetic lines of force”, when in fact this
field is a
conjugating double throw double sink Ether bubble made from macromagnetic preponderances resultant from a coherent
dielectric
counterspatial stricture from electrification in the creation of a “magnet”.

The Bloch wall (dielectric inertial plane) is the equator of a gravitational sphere, which can be seen from any
field-viewing medium.
The implications and meaning of this will be discussed elsewhere.

Electrification of a ferrous mass causes an extraction of the inter-atomic magnetic ‘equator’ into a singular coherent
macro-magnetic
preponderance of mirror hyperbolas but inverse in spin direction as spatially necessitated, these are a hourglass
geometric form which
are the maximum inverse spherical throw as impelled by inter-atomic dielectric capacitance resultant from
electrification in the
creation of either an electromagnet or a permanent magnet.

The centrifugal vortex at the outer edge of any magnetic is at its peak since the line of the dielectric boundary ends
at the polarized
surface of any magnet (since mass therein also terminates). Dielectric retardation and constriction ends. Just as any
centrifugal liquid
inside a cylinder is bound by the cylinder wall and accelerates upon breaking the crest of the lip of that cylinder, so
too is the
centrifugal magnetic vortex upon leaving the physical magnet where dielectric constraint terminates. Logically so
magnetism being
the conjugate to dielectricity, the epicenters of maximum velocity are inverse, the centripetal dielectric has max
velocity at the center
of the magnet, whereas the magnetism has its max velocity at the outside edge of the “magnet” centrifugally (dielectric
electrified
object), however this is inverse, magnetically, upon centripetal voidance, or return.

As an aside, the notion of the regenerative effects from a magnet are less than ideal at either pole. Rather a minimum
of 3 large 2x2x1
block magnets of high power arranged radially in a semi-circle with poles going around in a semi-circle in a
non-attractive
arrangement (N against N or S against south. In the case of 3 block magnets it would be SN-NS-SN) fashion and the
dielectric inertial
planes would be extending inwards and crossing one another like 3 intersecting centripetal dielectric knives, or
accretion disks. This
would have the utmost tissue regenerative benefit. All life and regeneration lies along the dielectric, not the
magnetic.

In the process of electrification, the magnet against the dielectric reflector causes dielectric torque pulsations upon
the conductive
material in the creation of electrical current. This dielectric plane manipulation is easily demonstrated in
electrification of any
permanent magnet where the dielectric inertial plane has been twisted against its inertial plane of equilibrium when
electrified once
again, post-creation.

Where maximum deceleration on the centrifugally emitted magnetic circulation meets that of the centripetally
acceleration returning
circulation marks the magnetic boundary.

Magnetism is almost rather literally a magneto-dielectric gyroscope in which the dilated inter-atomic dielectric
‘flywheel’ created in
electrification is counterbalanced by the centrifugal and centripetal (polarized) Z-axial magnetic aperture, which is
the accurate model
of magnetism, up to a point. This highly analogous discovery by myself is not how or why I modeled magnetism accurately,
but was
rather discovered after the fact, as I was searching for the highest possible model of analogous demonstration for this
conjugate nature
of magneto-dielectricity.

Dielectricity is the Ether under torsion and torque at its inertial plane; magnetism is a spatial circular reciprocating
vortex, an Etheric

pair of fountains and countersinks. Electricity is the dynamic radial or reciprocating polarization of the Ether.

N on N or S on S don’t terminate within each other, since this is a positive pressure gradient on the same plane and not
a vacuum or
voidance pressure plane in an inverse CW on CCW movement, but this is all driven by dielectricity. Nature has no poles,
only CW
and CCW spin and mutually seeking pressures of equilibrium.

A magnet attracts other iron because of Ether pressure gradients being unequal in the extreme in the “magnet”. This
acceleration of the
iron is like a stick entering a fast moving river or current.

A magnet is no different than a dipole antenna, dielectricity is the driver, and counterspatial contraction is the
reflector. CW and CCW
spins are the directors. Low-pressure Ether gradients are receivers-sinks. Magnetism terminates on itself but only in
low pressure
gradients of opposite spin vortexes.

**Below: Single 3mm neodymium cube “magnet” and pure bismuth disk (highest diamagnetic element), one pole marked green,
and the other black. When pushed or tilted off the bismuth, the one polarity will always spin off CW, and the other
polarity
always spins off CCW. There is absolute and undeniable proof (proof after proof without end) that there is inverse
magnetic
centrifugal divergent spin reciprocation off the polarized faces of any “magnet”.**

In the case of superconductors, nothing is added, only the magnetic bases have been closed off in the extremely low
temperatures. The
entire magneto-dielectric inter-atomic has been closed off for the permeability of magnetism. It is the case that the
“superconductor” is
really a magnetic reflector in its super chilled condition. Magnetism is definitionally spatial movement, in cooling a
superconductor
(really a super-magnetic barrier) one has created an object with near-0 magnetic inter-atomic ‘porosity’.

Dielectricity comes before magnetism, no motion, no magnetism, and when there is almost no magnetism in a super-cooled
temperature there is dielectric supra-coherency, which is a super-‘conductor’ (really a super magnetic-reflector).

Opposite poles of a bar magnet thrust away from each other as far as they can go. That is the very purpose of the
electric current
which bifurcates the dielectric and magnetic equilibrium. If opposite poles attracted each other they would have to be
logically located
in the center point of any magnetic (electrified) mass, instead of "pushing" away from each other to the very ends. CW
and CCW
(clockwise and counter clockwise) pressure gradients weave around and thru each other, and attraction is a perceptual
misdirection; so
too is repulsion. Like everything else in this world, all has to do with spin. There are no opposite charges attracting
each other as
regards magnets or magnetism. There is only charge and discharge and their spatial pressure gradients which comprise any
field and
which are Ether in principle; discharge is merely a degenerative function of charge. Nature has no conception of
polarity, logically and
reductively so, only CW and CCW spin pertaining to force gradients as relates to EM, magnetism, and gravity in space and
over time.

Magnetism is a versor with (space in the field) space, and dielectricity is a versor in counterspace, electromagnetism
is a dimensional
versor with space and counterspace, which is why there is confusion as to its behavior to “act both as a particle and a
wave”. However
such insane quantum abstractions are purely absurd; light, like all TEM is pure inductance with a center-radial
dielectric component.
This is the very same reason why magnetism and TEM can be lensed and directed by specific geometrical shapes (Yagi
antennas,
lenses, dipoles, reflectors, etc.).

Spatial and counterspatial conjugates regarding micro-magnetic, or macro-magnetic induction between dielectricity and
magnetism is
the basis for the quadrature of the universe.

**Below: How Ether fields, magnetic and dielectric together, against one another, conjugate in a binding system. This is
“Field
Incommensurability”, or F.I.**

The equator of a bar magnet is the basis for the zero base of curvature and is the dielectric counterspatial inertial
plane. Iron filings
reaching out from either pole will curve gradually in the ever-changing pressure gradients which surround the poles.
Science wrongly
calls these curved lines magnetic lines of force, which do not exist, they’re pressure gradients in and of the Ether.
When the low-
pressure curved lines reach the equator which divides the two poles in their spatial vectors, they reverse and repeat
their curvature as
though reflected by a mirror, which however this perceptual mistake is due to the Ether gradients which are empirically
non-
quantifiable. However curvature and rebounding at the dielectric plane only occurs in intermediate pressure centrifugal
magnetic
expulsions which are unable to overcome the dielectric centripetal barriers at a given distance from the magnetic (
rather dielectro-
gravimetric) centerpoint.

All motions in fields are polarized, are curved, and all curvature is spiral because all motion contains counter-motion
or reaction (shot-
recoil, charge-discharge etc.), necessitating a double vortex on any magnetized mass. There are no N and S poles in a
magnet; only
polarized CW and CCW vortex spins and even THIS is still a conceptual spatial error of concept reification, all
extension is polarized,
all spin is merely ‘inverse’ as a perceptual defect.

The rubbish and nonsense that any magnet “has a N and S pole” is a perceptual insanity. Any bar magnet can be cut a
trillion times
into slices like a salami and the very topmost portion will be a bar magnet with CW and CCW spin vortexes (‘N and S
poles’), and
likewise for any portion in the middle or the very bottom.

Just as extreme cold contracts superconductors and makes their magnetic field planes or bases non-existent / diamagnetic
in
domination; magnets have, due to electrification, greatly expanded dielectric bases and are macro-magnetic resultantly
after-the-fact to
the charging. Magnets (dielectric objects) are also coherent in their radiative Ether vortexes which follow the coherent
charge in
expansive and reductive spiral movements.

**Logically so since magnetism is a spatial field, extreme cold is a form of dielectric induction.** Just as
ferromagnetic proximity to a
magnet is magnetic induction; extreme cold = lower inter-atomic volume which = higher capacitance = greater
dielectricity since
dielectricity is greater inverse to the space. Less space, less magnetism, by induction thru inter-atomic contraction,
which is inverse to
the interatomic contraction from electrification in which dielectric capacitance is greatly amplified and increased in
its multiplicative
by means of being compounded rather than amplified thru means of inter-atomic contraction from extreme cold.
Multiplicative
compounding by electrification, or inter-atomic phase coherency from spatial atomic contraction, and loss of magnetic
potential due to
extreme cold. Without coincidence this is how radiation and magnetism (i.e. heat and otherwise) are symbolically
identical on many
levels.

In a magnet, the added charge in its creation causes atomic contraction as the spin vortex decreases in radius and
increases in speed
and moves from in-between the spherical structure to be expelled as a coherent jet from the base of the magnetic field
plane of the
atom due to field incommensurability, a field-phase pressure conjugation natural to magneto-dielectric binding systems.
Necessitated
reactions from charge saturation of the atomic ferrous material causes dielectric saturation and micro-magnetic
induction to occur and
thereby overflow expulsion of the magnetism into the bell-disk geometry we now understand.

Without phyllotactic like CW on CCW or CCW on CW field interlacing, magnetic like on like polarizations will not come
together.
Using simplex Moire’ geometric proofs, I prove that like on like spin creates enormous torsional compression against an
already
centered pair of conjugate dielectric planes. This is the highest geometric point of compressional movement allowed in
magnetic body
accelerations towards each other. In great electrification, this is how a rail gun works. A rail gun works by an
enormous dielectric
inertial pulse of expulsion.

While magnetism reciprocates spatially its movement is always towards the dielectric inertial centripetal plane. While
dielectricity and
electricity are counterspatial, their movements are radial and generative. Magnetism is a spatial conjugation, a
polarization moving
outwards in increasing and decreasing pressure gradients towards the dielectric inertial plane, whereas the centripetal
counterspatial
dielectric increases towards electro-stable generation and is discharged, or terminated in mass and resultantly gravity.
A spatial
reciprocation and rebounding (in the case of a permanent magnet) occurs towards and against the dielectric like a
limitless polarized
fountain with a rebounding counterspatial sink. Literally a one-way polarized Ether portal ever attempting to sink the
magnetic Ether
pressures in voidance against a centripetal rebounding dielectric inertial plane. Since magnetism and dielectricity move
opposite each
other, this special (as illustrated in the plates) magneto-dielectric geometry is created.

The grand misunderstanding, in ignorance by some, that a magnet has “four poles” is only mistaking observed effects of
the
magnetism reciprocating in low pressures against the dielectric plane. The polarized Ether (magnetism) reciprocating
along and
against the dielectric, which is perpendicular to the magnetic (in the binding system, but always moving apart 180 from
each other, but
perceptually 90 degrees due to due the binding magneto-dielectric architecture), is the reason for this misunderstanding
of observed
effects.

The grand misunderstanding, in ignorance by some, is that a magnet is emitting something, is “emitting magnetism”.
Magnetism is, of
course, merely a polarized Ether bubble from electrification (not ‘magnetization’ as conventionally understood by the
common
person) of the iron, or neodymium-iron-boron mass, or in an electromagnet, or as is the case in the inter-atomic
magneto-dielectric
volume. When a magnet is present (in the conventional macro-magnetic model), the specific polarized magnetic field is
present and
moves in CW and CCW vortex (or in radial circumferential movements thru transmission lines) thru and around this
fountain-sink
Ether portal with a greatly increased dielectric plane at which magnetism is spatially displaced on a macro level.

Logically so, magnetism, gravity, electricity, dielectricity are only distinctions without a difference in speaking
conventionally about
nuances of the modalities of the Ether, either counterspatial, spatial, radial, centripetal, centrifugal, or polarized.
Magnetism is merely
the model expression of Ether polarization in a spatially reciprocating circular format. Like gravity, magnetism is the
radiative, or
terminal (negative) of electricity; whereas gravity is the terminal of dielectricity (as mass in creation,
atrributionally gravity after the
fact).

A former mystery of magnetism now solved: It has long been a mystery as to why the N-S running Alaska oil pipeline is
magnetized
as the vast amounts of oil running thru the steel pipe churn down the line, however the explanation is simple, the
pipeline is being
inducted by the movement of the dielectrically charged oil as it passes thru the vortex torrent of the earths
magnetosphere, which in
turn like the magnet thru the copper pipe demonstrates the Lenz law, is causing magnetic induction of the pipeline from
dielectric
induction of the moving oil thru the earths field vortex.

**The ‘magnet’ isn’t a magnet; it’s an electrified dielectric object**

_“Let no one say man has evolved sufficiently until he fully understands magnetism both in what it is and how it works”_
**_– Author_**

Dielectric induction vs. magnetic induction. If any small flat square of copper or other high dielectric reflector is
waved horizontally
against the horizontal dielectric plane of a magnet, instant resistance is felt from dielectric induction. However if
the copper piece is
waved vertically against the horizontal dielectric plane, there is no reactance (very low). As magnetic polarization
affects the magnetic
materials (ferrous) so too does the dielectric either move against the magnetic, or as in the example just mentioned,
the dielectric
induces the dielectric in the copper piece (and repels the magnetic in same). Magnetism against the superluminal
dielectric (copper for
example) moving in direct opposition to the magnetic spatial field is the electromotive force in the creation of
electricity. However
dielectric induction along the perpendicular plane to the magnetic polarizations, under very meager motions can be
easily felt, as is the
cases that the dielectric plane of the magnet is causing boundary dielectric vacuum torsion in the copper piece.

The magnet is the dielectric object with magnetism as an attribute, but the magnetically induced ferrous object is
anti-dielectric!
The question is begged why a wafer thin magnet can be placed on its edge parallel to the dielectric plane of another
larger magnet, and
yet any other ferrous disk of identical dimensions, absolutely cannot be; it can be placed perpendicular to the
dielectric plane of the
larger magnet, but never in parallel to it, reaction is identical to placing (attempting to) N on N or S on S (or as the
case really is CW
on CW, or CCW on CCW). With the wafer thin magnet resting on its edge in perfect harmony at the dielectric inertial
plane in
parallel, if you attempt to twist it perpendicular, tremendous resistance is felt and the magnet will leap to either CW
or CCW conjugate
pole of the larger magnet; inversely to this, a steel disk or ferrous flat piece will rest in harmony perpendicular to
the dielectric plane
but never in parallel to it, and tremendously resist same in brining it in parallel to the larger magnets dielectric
radial inertial plane.
The case is that while both the magnet (permanent) and the steel disk are “magnetized”, the reality is the genuine
magnet is electrified
(in its creation), is a dielectric object (in the order of 80 to 90%) with a necessitated coincidental and
atrributionally large magnetic
field; whereas the ferrous disk is merely magnetically induced in the field of the magnet of which the ferrous disk
being so
magnetically induced has an extremely tight counterspatial inter-atomic dielectric volume. The disk is merely
magnetically induced,
whereas the disk magnetic is an electrified dielectric object.
The common idiocy of conventional understanding is that a super magnet (or any magnet) is a “magnetic object, emitting
magnetism” which is absolutely not the case, nothing is being emitted as has been mentioned (a polarized Ether field),
further still a
magnet is an (permanent or electromagnet) electrified object with a powerful dielectric inertial plane which causes
enormous spatial
(Ether portal) magnetic displacement of which the common person deems said object “a magnet” because its magnetic
attributes are
easily and well known, but its dielectric dominance is almost unknown, existing in dominance at the perpendicular to the
reciprocating
magnetic portals. Returning to the steel disk which vociferously resists being placed in parallel or proximity to the
dielectric, as is the
case, magnetism repels dielectricity and vice versa, the magnetically induced disk is overwhelmingly (temporarily)
magnetic and the
repulsion is occurring from the dielectric plane of the magnet upon the ferrous disk, the ferrous disk is / does cause
dielectric torque
which is overwhelmingly powerful. Literally the ferrous disk (which is magnetically induced in the field of magnetism)
is causing Z-
axis dielectric torsion along the XY-axis of the dielectric plane of the magnet, like twisting an extremely powerful
gyroscope along its
Z-axis, or axis of radial rotation. Conventional idiocy is that ‘opposites attract’, they in fact do not, opposites
repel; this logic assumes
that a steel disk will leap to a magnet, however only along the Z-axis of centrifugal magnetic preponderance, and
absolutely not to the
XY-axis of the dielectric plane. The wafer thin disk magnet however will rest on its edge along and in parallel to the
larger magnet,
both magnets are dielectro-electrified objects, like attracting like, dielectric along the dielectric. The wafer thin
ferrous disk however is
purely a magnetically induced object, which cannot be brought close to the dielectric inertial plane of the magnet.
Likewise, a wafer
thin sheet or disk of copper or aluminum, while not leaping to the dielectric plane will break their movement if swept
in parallel
against the dielectric plane; the copper or aluminum being dielectric reflectors are being dielectrically induced (and
magnetically
contracted), since they are not ferromagnetic (-ally inducible materials).
Edgewise motion perpendicular across the dielectric medium by the magnetized iron disk offers very little resistance,
however
impossible to do so parallel to the dielectric plane. The exact inverse exists for the other disk, which is electrified,
the “magnet” which
its edgewise-dielectric inertial plane will rest perfectly in parallel to the dielectric plane but the disk’s dielectric
plane will (not
possible) encounter enormous resistance in attempting twisting against the dielectric and into the magnetic flow. This
is a hydrostatic-
like Ether pressure in both examples. The value of this pressure is one half the product of dielectric and magnetic
density.
A dielectric reflector is in reality a dielectric “magnet” (like to like), it is a ‘reflector’ such that it can, in
electrification, be pulsed
and its superluminal dielectric inter-atomic inertial plane torqued as a sweeping magnetic field causes dielectric
precessional torsion,
which produces electrification. A dielectric repulsor is, obviously magnetism (and vice versa), whether as conjugated in
a magnetic
field in a magnet (an electrified object) or in a magnetically induced ferrous piece, or in our example, the thin steel
wafer. Again, the
lunacy and common conception is that a nail etc. that is adhered to any magnet is, like the magnet, “also a magnet, is
magnetized” is
absolute insanity. The case is that only the “magnet” of the first part is the ‘genuine magnet (meaning electrified
object)’, but we
confuse attribute with principle. The super-magnet or electromagnet is an electric object, in the case of the permanent
magnet, a
‘frozen field distention object’.
The permanent magnet is an electrically charged dielectric object, but that dielectricity is counterspatial, inertial,
radial, and
centripetal, humans do not (none do really) understand that all such permanent magnets have magnetism as secondary
attributes to
their electrification. That magnetism is spatial, circular, centrifugal (and centripetal) and polarized and acts upon
other magnets, and
ferrous materials, has lead humans thru all history to deem these objects as “magnetic objects”. The minor attribute of
magnetism in a

magnet has supplanted (in the minds of common folk) the major principle, or attribute of its dielectricity. The correct
way of
understanding a permanent magnet is that it is an anti-magnetic object of inflated (however not spatially) dielectric
dominance which
has, as necessitated, coincidentally an enormous conjugated magnetic field occurring as a pair of reciprocating
inverse-sphere
hyperbolas opposite to the dielectric inertial plane.
As if one were to take a porous sphere with clay inside and insert a needle to the center and inject it with a large
volume of water,
the clay would ooze out of the sphere in thin strings; such is the case of a pre-‘magnet’ which is electrified (water)
at which point the
clay (magnetism) would become a spatially dominant feature. Any simplex mind would so deem the sphere as a “magnet”, or
a “clay
ball”. That the water (dielectric) is clear and invisible and has almost no spatial interaction with anything and is a
compressed
accretion disk that is counterspatial, inertial, radial, and centripetal, people would immediately associate such an
object as a “clay” or
“magnetic” object such that the magnetism is spatial, circular, centrifugal (and centripetal) and polarized. Human minds
do not think
electrically or counterspatially, as such any “magnet” (electrified dielectric object) is so deemed a magnet by the
spatial senses of
common humans.
In the case of the steel wafer disk, while magnetized and in the field of the magnet, it has undergone dielectric
contraction and
resultantly magnetic dilation which is why it cannot be brought in parallel to the dielectric inertial plane of the
permanent (“real”)
magnet created from electrification. In the case of the dielectric reflector (copper sheet etc.) along in parallel to
the dielectric plane, it
is has undergone magnetic contraction and dielectric dilation. Magnetism and dielectricity are always working in lowest
possible
pressure gradients to move 180 degrees from each other. A permanent “magnet” has enormous dielectric dilation and
resultant
magnetic secondary attributes. Obviously so, the disk magnet will rest on its thin edge (like on like), dielectric upon
dielectric, parallel
in tandem with the larger magnets dielectric inertial plane. The mind of “modern” man must be deprogrammed as pertains
his concept
of what a magnet and magnetism is. Telling anyone offhand that there is another plane in the middle of a magnet between
its
reciprocating fields that in fact outright repels a magnetically induced, or magnetized ferrous object, is rejected as
either insane or
obtuse, however even a 10 year old can reproduce this fact readily. A genuine magnet is an electrified mass with an
enormous stored
dielectric field, and its likewise secondary attribute, magnetism. In the case of the magnetically induced ferrous disk,
it is magnetized
while in the field, but it is not polarized in the genuine sense as only applicable to the electrified mass which is
polarized from
dielectric preponderance. It must be clearly differentiated that a magnetized, or magnetically induced ferrous object is
within a
magnetic field but it is not of its own accord a polarized magnet, which is also why you cannot place in parallel such a
steel disk
alongside the dielectric inertial plane of the genuine “magnet”.
As is the case in cutting any bar magnet perpendicular to its polarization, of course we note that we can have infinite
magnets with
each one having a CW and CCW ‘pole’. While this is fairly well know, what is not known is the theory of magnetic domains
is
incorrect, rather mostly so. Conceptually it is accepted that the 1 magnet cut into 10, 100, 1000 each with their own
pole is merely a
reduction in size of what are infinitesimally smaller “magnetized pieces” or smaller magnets. What is not understood or
mentioned
however is that each smaller magnet has an immediate center-seeking dielectric plane. It is literally as if any piece
removed from the
earth, it were sliced horizontally along its polarity, would, at the speed of light (possibly faster), create a sphere
to match the volume
of the slice with an immediate equatorially spinning inertial line. These infinite numbers of magnets with perfect
polarity are not
resultant from infinite numbers of magnetic domains but that the electrified “magnet”, is like gravity itself (both
centripetal), and both
are instantly self-seeking.
A permanent “magnet” is a permanent battery in two dimensions. The process of pushing the magnetic lines of force
outwards in
electrification, in the creation of the magnet represents stored energy as in a rubber band stretched outwards. No power
is required to
maintain the stationary field of the “magnet”, this represents stored energy. This trapped inductance of energy is
unique to the ferrous
materials and to the hexagonal nature of neodymium ferrous objects. When the power supply circuit is removed from
electrification at
the end of the creation of the “magnet”, there is no interruption in current. The extremely special incommensurable
geometry of the
spatial-counterspatial magneto-dielectric nature of a magnet allows for this energy storage in the dielectric inertial
plane which has as
secondary attribute, the reciprocating magnetic field.
**From the illustrations below:** We have, at picture 1, the “magnetic” disk resting against gravity in parallel to the
dielectric plane
of the large 2x2x1” magnet, whose dielectric inertial plane is illustrated in green. In picture 2 we have the steel disk
sitting (it almost
will rest on its knife edge) perpendicular to the dielectric, which is the only low torque position in line with the
magnetic circular
induction, marked in red. In fact, even using a magnet twice this size, and many 100s of times the weight of the steel
disk, the torque
of the steel disk along the dielectric will move the magnet to keep a perfect perpendicular; the same is true in reverse
for the disk
“magnet” in parallel to the dielectric of the block. The steel disk is magnetized, is a magnetically induced disk in
whole, whereas the
block and disk in picture one are electrified, are “magnets” only conventionally but are in fact dielectric objects in
near-whole, and so-
deemed “magnets” because the magnetic ‘part’ is spatial and the near-whole, dielectric, is counterspatial and radial.
This is magneto-
dielectric momentum; identical to gyroscopic inertia, however here we have dielectrical centripetal inertia and circular
magnetic
inertia expanding along the Z-axis (see diagrams of magnetism in other sections of this article). Massive confusion
exists that this is
the “boundary wall, domain wall, Bloch wall” of a magnet, it is not, it is the primary mover of the magnetism, having
been electrified,
it is the dielectric inertial plane. Breaking the magnet will cause an immediate (faster than light) creation of a new
self-centering
dielectric plane. As per figure 1 I can place the brick magnet on a 500 pound refrigerator and not making contact with
the tiny few-
grams disk magnet, twist it from parallel against the dielectric plane against the brick magnet and make the 500 pound
refrigerator
shake resultantly there is so much dielectric torque at play. This among many other experiments is proof that
dielectricity is at play in
any magnet as primary, and magnetism itself as merely an attributional secondary. You certainly could not cause such a
reaction by
way of magnetism alone from the disk magnet to the 500-pound object, that would be impossible; only by means of
dielectric torque.

**Magnets, naturally, are spatially self-folding, but not due to magnetism**

_“If man but understood magnetism in true, he would seize the universe by the tail”_ **_– poem_**

How many flat magnets have I broken over the years on accident to realize an extremely important point, and then start
breaking
them on purpose to further prove the point! As is the case, thin disk magnets with the dielectric inertial plane on
edge, or hard drive
magnets with the dielectric plane running along the flat curve invariably desire self destruction, self-folding at the
dielectric plane.
Hyper-logical, simple, and necessitated in retrospect given the fact that the dielectric plane is distended in all
magnets and is
centripetal and counterspatial by nature. Magnets will rupture and self-collapse in upon themselves at their dielectric
planes! In the
case of a disk magnet where the dielectric lays along the thin edge, obviously breaking it along that edge is readily
impossible,
however the dielectric will self-fold along the weakest point at which it can draw in its centripetal force (“black
hole”, a misnomer of
course, since black holes do not exist), by breaking into four pieces like a pizza cut with 4 perfect 90 degree giant
slices, and
immediately self-fold to the smallest, tightest spatial dimension possible. Every new break in the flat magnets creates
a new self-
centered dielectric inertial plane that wants desperately to spatially fold on itself!
Factually and mathematically, if a large thin ceramic magnet or a new hybrid crystalline structure (something far
superior to
neodymium iron boron) were able to be brought up to a gauss level approximately 400% beyond current max levels of N55,
and then
released from its structurally binding form, keeping it spatially in place like a bookmark between the folds of a book,
this magnet, at
currently unachievable gauss states, would **instantly and violently self-fold** at multiple breaks into a volume (
depending on radius
and thickness) approximately 1/6th its current surface area. This fact is undeniable and proof positive of the
counterspatial nature of
dielectricity, long ago well established by Tesla, Maxwell, Heaviside, and Steinmetz. This is a glaringly obvious fact
from electrical
transmission lines where the smaller the bounding structure, the greater the dielectric capacitance. _“Hereby we may say
that the
dielectric field is contractive, and the magnetic field is expansive.”_
The endless hard drive magnets I have broken (now many times on purpose) will invariably split and self-fold along their
dielectric
planes which run across the middle of the thin semi-circular hard drive magnets. On several occasions, in breaking the
more powerful
hard drive magnets 3 to 5” electrical charges are shot out like lightning at the instant of breaking, releasing the
dielectric (some of)
inertial momentum into an immediate energy free space transference! The most stable dielectric geometry of any magnet (
though most
not that powerful magnetically, because of dielectric stability) is a sphere. Thin powerful “magnets” are quick to take
any shock and
self-fold.
Conventionally one might, incorrectly, state that these thin magnets self-fold out of impetus for CW on CCW (‘poles’)
proximity,
however this is seeing things in reverse, these magnets fold along the lowest pressure point for the tightest (smallest)
spatial volume to
suit the dielectric nature of what a “magnet” genuinely is. This is of course, also why when two magnets are brought
together; the
dielectric planes immediately re-center themselves as one to the midpoint between the two. That dielectricity behaves
very closely to
gravity is no coincidence whatsoever. Since each new magnetic break creates a new dielectric self-centered inertial
plane, to insanely
think that the magnet will ‘fold due to the obvious attracting magnetic fields’ is thinking backwards, as do most
people. Likewise one
might look at a horses ass and declare horseshit (self-folding) to be the ‘product of the horse’ (magnetic field), when
in fact of course,
the ‘horse’, is merely the processor and digestion device (“magnet” mass) for the grass it’s fed (electrification
creating dielectric
dominance). This folding effect is pure logic and rooted in the “grass”, the electrification which creates a ‘frozen’
dielectrical
dominance over the “magnetic mass” which is as stated, a dielectric object in true. Like our horse, no grass (
electrification), no horse
(magnetization). As Maxwell and others have stated, dielectric precedes the magnetic.

**Below: The dielectric inertial plane of a typical hard drive magnet, on right is the conjunction of a folding magnet,
having
folded once already. This cross is the dielectric counterspace which will, given the chance, fold all possible
unnecessary space
into the smallest spatial volume possible. Only magnetism gives massiveness to mass and matter.**

The dielectric plane is always trying to transform any “magnet” of odd shapes and forms into a sphere. If you break a
flat hard
drive magnet roughly ten times you will end up with a jagged and sharp, albeit nevertheless a sphere. Since magnetism is
spatial and
dielectricity is counterspatial, more magnetism can be store in more space, and inversely so with dielectricity; from
this fact we can re-
affirm what we already know about the “magnet”, that it is a dielectric electrified object with magnetism as a secondary
incidental
byproduct, such that breaking a flat disk magnet of great spatial geometry will collapse into a smaller and smaller form
as possible,
proving that, of course, the “magnet” is the counterspatial seeking electrified object. When dielectricity far greatly
overcomes the
spatial magnitudinal pressures of mass, a special stellar object is formed.

As discovered on 7/15/2014, an inertial plane, long before magnets go into voidance (connection/ attraction), is forming
at the
decreasing equatorial line of the voidance-sphere. The implications for and of this are enormous. This discovery was
made using a
testing medium as yet undisclosed. Amazingly, this should have been predicted to occur. However as is the case, an
inertial plane
forms within the space (as an attribute OF the fields!) between the accelerating bodies undergoing voidance.
Dielectricity finds the
byproduct of its radiation field (magnetism), that being space, as intolerable. This is part of the conjugate nature of
and between
dielectricity and magnetism.

**Below: As just discovered, at the equatorial sphere of accelerating magnets, an inertial plane has already formed at
the
shrinking equatorial sphere. In an instant there is no magneto-dielectric difference between the space (as defined by
the fields)
between two accelerating magnets and that present in the center of any magnet, as a gravitative-dielectric
field-modality.**

**Below: Field incommensurability necessitates that magnets self-fold in dictate of the nature of the dielectric
inertial plane.**

**Magnetic pressure** is highest at the boundary points between mass-spatial barriers; at the outer edges of either
reciprocating pole, and
at the dead center of any magnet, its dielectric center, not its mass-center.
**Dielectric pressure** is highest as a torus of the dielectric center of any “magnet”, which is also the gravitative
center, additionally the
dielectric extents like an inertial plane torus along the equator of electrification, incorrectly called the “Bloch
wall”, but which in fact
is the dielectric inertial centripetal plane of the dominant force in any so-called “magnet”.

**Below: Broken ring magnet “re-attached” as a ring, but NOT AS IT WAS BEFORE IT WAS BROKEN, but HOW it can exist

on the

crescent)
it can rest, in this case, AS A RING. The same would be true of a disk magnet broken in half as well. This is the action
of
dielectric counterspace in how “magnets” DO and WILL ‘self-fold’ and decrease as much space as possible. On left is the
field
view of the flipped (self-flipped) broken ring magnet.**

broken ring magnet seen edge-on. The cross, or X pattern is the ‘first stage’ of delectricity’s ‘desire’ to fold-up
space into the
smallest volume possible. Here we see on the photo at right, from left to right, N, S, and bottom, S, N.**

Electrified (dielectric or electric):

**1. Reflects light (EM) spatially along XY-axis** = dielectric radial conductor (‘dielectric reflector’ as meaning
magnetic reflector that
is dielectric in nature, non-ferrous) along the Z-axis = electrical reflector at the Z-axis = electrical attractor at
the spatial circular XY-
axis (radially polarized when current is present from AC electrification) = magnetic reflector. Any strong magnetic
reflector is
likewise a dielectric conductor and an EM (light) reflector (but not its center co-axial dielectric component).
Electricity and
magnetism flow spatially and radially in circular polarization along the XY-axis to the perpendicular Z-axis dielectric.
Reflects light =
polarization reflector and counterspatial conductor. A perfect conductor is a perfect magnetic reflector; it has no
magnetic
permeability due to being supra-dielectrically coherent, as in the case of a super cooled yttrium barium copper oxide
disk. Supra-
dielectric coherency is due to extremely low magnetic movements and high in-phase dielectric coherency. A super cooled
perfect
magnetic reflector is, in essence, a dielectric ‘laser’, as would be the case a ‘P.A.D.I.M.C.’ (Phased Amplification of
Dielectricity by
Interatomic Magnetic Constriction). Any interatomic volume and movement is magnetic by principle, the dielectric phasing
by super
cooling is magnetic retardation.
**2. Magnet or electromagnet (electrified ferrous object)** = non-magnetically dominant object = dielectric object =
magnetic
induction reflector along the XY-axis = dielectric at the XY-axis, magnetic at the polarized expanding Z-axis = magnetic
attractor
along the expanding Z-axis.
**3. DC is polarization at the source; AC is polarization along the radial path of conduction.**
Not electrified:
**4. Ferrous material** (not electrified, magnetic medium) = magnetically induced is a dominant magnet = magnetic
inductive object =

spatial magnetic capacitor at XYZ-axis.

**5. Material that absorbs light** (dielectric medium)= dielectric capacitor at XYZ axis = non-ferrous, dielectric
object (if illuminated
by EM).

**Electrical current, or permanent magnet?**

_“Is that the egg laid by the chicken, or is that the chicken that was hatched from the egg. One fool says the chicken

another fool says the egg hatched the chicken first. I tell you that regardless of both, you don’t have either one
without the farmer and

The question becomes, of the two diagrams below, one being graphed, the other showing iron filings on the left, which of
the two
is showing the cross section of a permanent magnet, and which is showing current moving in opposite directions as in AC
lines (blue
representing the dielectric, and red the magnetic)? The answer is that both are showing both current moving in opposite
directions and
the cross section along the Z-axis of a permanent magnet. In the iron filings illustration on the left, you need only
connect the two
conductive AC wires with a line (however in 3D it would be a flattened toroidal accretion disk) and you have the XY-axis
‘accretion
disk’ of dielectric counterspatial, inertial, radial, and centripetal dominance and the vertically expansive spatial,
circular, centrifugal
(and centripetal) and polarized magnetic reciprocating field. Of the diagram on the right, you need only connect the two
AC
conductive wires with a line once again, and compress vertically, the blue dielectric lines into a flatter profile to
fit the dielectric
geometry into a magnetic mass (or “magnet”) rather than free hanging space AC lines. Both illustrations are that of
field or currents
(both Ether in nature) moving in opposite directions and the cross section of a permanent magnet. Likewise in an
alternating current
situation, the feed lines are pressing apart in free hanging space which allows for more magnetism (whereas current in
the same
direction, the current lines are pulled together which allows for more dielectric storage). This electrification in
creating a magnet
means the dielectric, while centripetal, exists predominately like a gyroscopic flywheel mass, along the periphery at
which the center
Z-axis is the reciprocating magnetic field portal. In its fixed form of a permanent magnet, the compressing dielectric
centripetal
counter (spatial) force is working in direct opposition to the magnetic, with the dielectric attempting to come together
at the XY-axis
centerpoint, while at the same time, the magnetic is attempting to push the XY-axis apart at the centerpoint,
resultantly like stepping
down flow from a larger diameter pipe into a smaller one, there is increased pressure, or in this case, increased
magnetic pressure of
which we, incorrectly, deem an electrified dielectric object, as a “magnet” or “magnetic object”.
Ironically (not so) electrification in the creation of a permanent magnet creates significant spatial magnetic
polarization, whereas an
identical relationship exists likewise in the spatial-counterspatial geometry as created in current lines that are
polarized, and have
current moving in opposite directions. This is the harmonic conjugate relationship of magnetism and dielectricity,
spatial and
counterspatial, both moving 180 degrees opposite one another, however in a binding electrical system, or a “magnetic”
mass create an
unique centripetal-centrifugal, radial-circular, inertial-radiative, spatial-counterspatial set of relationships, so
fully and accurately
spelled out by the gods of electrical theory, Maxwell, Heaviside, Faraday, Tesla, Steinmetz, and others.
Both diagrams show the same geometry, but in different electrical dimensions. Alternating electrical current being
polarized,
produces the same magneto-dielectric geometry as electrification produces in the creation of an ‘electrified’ dielectric
object
(“magnet”) with spatial magnetic polarization. Electrical current polarization produces a temporary building radiative
polarized (there
is no other kind) magnetic field, or in the other case, magnetic polarization formed in the electrification of a ferrous
mass into a
dielectric object with a fixed radiative magnetic field. When electrified, the ferrous mass retains (due to the special
inter-atomic
magneto-dielectric elasticity of the volume of iron) high dielectric capacitance, also proven in experimentation in
releasing this
dielectricity (light reflector = dielectric conductor, iron in its special nature can be stably dielectrically saturated
from electrification).
In one, polarization exists in the opposite-moving electrical counterspatial current to produce radiative polarized
magnetism, in the
other, polarization exists in the spatially radiative magnetic as created from dielectric saturation from its formation
by electrification.
Electricity terminates in magnetism, but not the dielectric (which terminates in gravity/ mass creation). This is how
Tesla was able to
have dielectric systems with no corresponding magnetic component; whereas all electrical systems have spatially
radiative (and
terminating) magnetic components, either from electrification in the creation of a magnet by dielectric ferrous
saturation, or by
opposite moving current lines, or in a DC line with a radiative circular magnetic field. Either a strong dielectric
saturation creates a
macro-dominant magnetic portal, or a strong pair of current lines moving in opposite directions will produce same.
To think that an electromagnet is different than a permanent magnet is wrong, both terminate electricity into the
dielectric upon
which magnetism is exuded. That the electromagnet is being fed by a power source to create the magnetic field as it
terminates into
the dielectric is no different than a permanent magnet which has been electrified and, due to the magneto-dielectric
‘elasticity’ of iron
retains that dielectric geometry permanently. It is wrongly thought, as is the case with most peoples minds that are
looking at
magnetism upside down and backwards, that iron is ‘ferromagnetic’ in potential, but it is just the inverse, rather that
it is supra-
dielectric in capacitance (and more so in hexagonal neodymium iron boron architectures). Magnetism cannot exist as an
independent
entity in any form in and of itself, it must be induced by another, as in TEM, or as a permanent magnet, or as an
electromagnet, or as
the byproduct of galactic charging as found in galactic jets, around DC lines, or around AC lines. Electricity
terminates into
magnetism by way of a dielectric-capacitant object (dielectro-electromagnetism, or ‘electromagnetism’ contains a radial
dielectric Z-
axis component).
Magnetism is literally the polarization of dielectricity as contained or induced by an object (permanent magnet, TEM,
electromagnet), the two are conjugate and inversely proportional in their magneto-dielectric architecture, where one is
circular,
dielectricity is radial, where one is centrifugal-centripetal, dielectricity is centripetal, where one is radiative,
dielectricity is inertial,

where one is spatial (polarized), dielectricity is counterspatial. This conjugate pair creates and props up the entire
universe, and powers
all atomic elements, is responsible for charge, discharge, induction, radiation, generation, polarization, mass creation
which likewise
terminates into gravity. An incapacity to understand this fundamental is a roadblock to any true comprehension of
magnetism or
dielectricity. Where magnetism seeks static circular polarization, electrification is a radial dynamic polarization.

```
Magnetism: 1. Centrifugal (centripetal on return = polarization) 2. Circular 3. Radiative 4. Spatial
Dielectricity: 1. Centripetal 2. Radial 3. Inertial 4. Counterspatial
```

**Magnetic Geometry, or the Bell-disk mutual-repulsion model of magneto-dielectricity**

The great mystery, now understood, is that while magnetism and dielectricity move 180 degrees from each other, in
binding closed
systems where gravity is immense, either in galactic structures, or in nuclear structures, the disk-dumbbell formations
of dielectricity
and magnetism move 90 degrees (only perceptually, rather completely opposite from each other in true) from each other in
the special
geometric formations of a disk and a pair of inverse double hyperbolas, since the structure is of course binding and
contractive, this is
the lowest pressure model of magneto-dielectric mutual repulsion. How do two opposite forces that are “tied” together in
a binding
system (inter-atomic, galactic, permanent magnet) move 180 degrees from each other when one is spatial and polarized,
and the other
is radial and counterspatial, the answer is an inertial plane accretion disk and a double hyperbola. What appears as
perpendicular
movement is in fact the maximum repulsion of a binding system.

**Below: This is the lynchpin, the missing secret of atomic volume, permanent magnets, galactic jets, and how Ether
fields,
magnetic and dielectric together, against one another, conjugate in a binding system. Radial-counterspatial and
circular-
spatial forces in a binding system (dielectricity and magnetism, the two co-principles of the universe) can only exist
in this
geometry (in a perfect example). This is “Field Incommensurability”, or F.I.**

**Below: Left is a computer proof that the maximum throw of an inverted sphere is a dumbbell shaped geometry. Second
picture is that of a double hyperbola of the magnetic dominances in a permanent magnet, third picture is the dielectric
stricture of the magneto-dielectric interatomic to create a macro-magnetic phenomena. Far right are atomic orbitals
showing
snapshot diagrams of what these magnetic dominances are relative to the nucleal fulcrum, at which one can always deduce
the
location of the dielectric in this system.**

The surface outer perimeter / edge of either portal (pole) on a magnet has the highest centrifugal pressure and velocity
upon exiting the
magnetic mass (opposite of that of a tornado, whose ground apex has the highest velocity and cone the lowest velocity).

Expulsion apex velocity is low, expulsion cone velocity is high. Centripetal apex sink velocity is highest. The
centripetal cone is the
magnetic spatial radius.

The expulsion cone velocity being high creates a preponderance of low Ether pressure (dilation) at the center of either
pole at which
the centripetal sink is directed. Low to moderate pressure expulsion will be directed at the Bloch wall from the side
equator rather than
centripetally thru the opposite end vortex.

**Below: Left, 100 nanometer scale proof of the geometry of magnetism. On the right is the inverse sphere geometry of
magnetic
dominances in any electrified system where the dielectric dominates over the magnetic.**

An expulsion vortex has highest acceleration at the cone and a centripetal vortex has highest acceleration at its apex.
Where Ether
pressure velocity equals Ether vacuum there is a return to the closest vacuum with a non-opposing spin.

A sink vortex has maximum velocity at its apex of the returning centripetal field, and the expulsion vortex on the
centrifugal cone, has
its highest velocity at the cone-base, opposite that of the centripetal returning vortex. Looking down on any ‘pole’
surface, this would
paint a velocity image of a single ringed bullseye where the center is maximum centripetal returning velocity, then an
intermediate
zone, all ringed by a high velocity centrifugal vortex of expulsion.

The centrifugal expulsion point of the magnet has the lowest Ether pressure gradients at the polarized centerpoint, to
which the
returning centripetal apex is directed and accelerated towards. This dilative vacuum is also the instrumental mechanism
of voidance,
or conventionally thought of as ‘attraction’ (so-called).

This is why the velocity on either pole of a magnet is greatest at its edge where centrifugal expulsion is occurring and
greater still at its
center where the apex of the returning conjugated ‘pole’ field is centripetally vortexing into the dielectric inertial
plane, or Bloch wall
of voidance, which is the epicenter of the lowest-pressure gradients.

The spatial base of any polarized magnetic double vortex has its geometric equilibrium at Phi, where its sloping
counterspatial apexes
are always at the intersection 1. This discovery has implications so important and far reaching, you cannot fathom it.
This is the 1-1-
Phi isosceles triangle of Pythagoras.

The maximum geometric expulsion of a point or sphere inversion is a double cone centrifugally leaving or inverting at a
negative
pressure of 1-1-Phi; of which a positive pressure of the field magnetic vortex leaves at a spiral of 1/Phi (.618).
Therefore the expulsion
**0-point apex is 1/phi^-3 (4.23606) and the 0-point motive is phi^-3 (.23606).** The missing secrets of Phi are covered
in another
article.

**Below: Left, a pair of cylinder magnets, in the middle a sphere magnet, on the right the field illustrations.**

**Below: Left is a circular magnet on a CRT display showing very clearly both the magnetic geometry and the dielectric
plane.
On the right we see low pressure magnetic field movements that are returning along the dielectric.**

**Below: Left, showing circular polarization against a CRT screen, on the right, detailed picture of the earths magnetic
field
showing clearly the dielectric plane at the equator.**

All magnetic geometry is a double expulsive centrifugal bubble vortex and double centripetal returning vortex and a
singular magnetic
field spatially polarized. A singular undivided Ether movement and perturbation.

That magnetic Ether pressure gradients are high on the surface from either centrifugal vortexes or returning centripetal
vortexes is a
source for the long held lack of discernment of magnetic vortexes.

**Below: Not coincidentally my discovery coincides perfectly with the QM model of certain atomic geometry, however in
error
they wrongly attribute this to ‘electrons’. What in fact you are seeing of course is the dielectric inertial plane and
the dumbbell
shaped magnetic preponderances as conjugated in the binding system of the atom. This geometry of course, depending on
charge, or magnetism, or nucleal charges, can become much more complex than this. Far right is field geometry of the
physical “magnet” showing dielectricity forced at, concentrated at the mid-point of the physical magnet. Likewise
showing is
the divergent discharge of dielectricity, the magnetism.**

Since magnetism is spatial, there is an optimum throw distance from the dielectric inertial plane at which the velocity
of the pressure
of expulsion is overtaken by vacuum centripetal forces which, in the case of extremely long magnets or bar magnets, the
preponderance of the double magnetic vortex bubble and the magnetic spin vortexes form a sphere around a magnet rather
than a
polarized double fountain at either end. Spatial acceleration in a geometric form can be extended only so far before
vacuum reversion
quickly overtakes expulsive throw. The ideal ratio is a base of 1 and a height of Phi, or just the inverse is also
ideal.

**Below: Very long bar magnet example where the physical magnet geometry can overthrow the actual field pressure at
either
end of normal CW or CCW rotation.**

**Below: Regardless of how many times you break a magnet against any line parallel to the dielectric inertial plane, you
will
have yet another magnet. This is field incommensurability, likewise self-similarity as also exists in a holographic
positive.**

**Magnetism continued**

All of the most fundamental principles of nature and the universe can be solved with simplex Euclidean math and
geometry; along
with Platonic logic. If same cannot solve it, it does not exist. **_- Author_**

Both electricity and magnetism seek discharge. That is not to say there is a negative terminal but a lower or vacuum
Ether pressure
into which electricity and magnetism seek to discharge themselves. Of electricity we speak of the ground whereas in
magnetism we
wrongly think of the “other pole” however the “other pole” is merely inverse spin, in fact the “ground” of a magnet is
self-terminating

on its lowest pressure gradient within the dielectric inertial plane.

Positive charge attracts positive charge and terminates into a negative discharge. Negative discharge repels both
negative discharges
and positive charge. The fact that electricity terminates into magnetism does not mean that it repels it. Termination is
not repulsion.

Counterspace is just a conceptual means of speaking about the Ether plane, where everything is produced, and all fields
are based in
this ‘medium’. Tesla knew this, Steinmetz, Heaviside, Maxwell, and even the fool Einstein, before he lost his mind,
agreed that
understanding is impossible without the Ether.

Magnetism is strictly an end product of dynamic polarization into static radiative polarization, or as the byproduct of
dielectric
saturation which expels the resident magnetism in a system. All magnetism is created as a byproduct of dielectric
manipulation, either
by electrification into a mass which distorts the dielectric (meaning acceleration and capacitance) and likewise in turn
the magnetic, or
as the necessitated conjugate to electrification in TEM. This binary of electrification is pure inductance in which the
electrical induces
the magnetic and vice versa. This reciprocal creation occurs along a counterspatial Ether plane in which the reciprocal
induction is
radiated.

Electricity and magnetism exist as separate appearances only when opposed. In non-opposition they disappear as in the
case of stable
inter-atomic field charges. They become one, meaning dielectric dominance in the inter-atomic causes appearances of the
macro-
magnetic.

**Below: The ‘gyroscopes’ analogy of field incommensurability as pertains to magneto-dielectric conjugate phasing from
electrification, in the creation of a permanent “magnet”. Self-similarity parallel to the dielectric inertial plane is
an absolute
necessity in dissection, or bifurcation along this plane.**

Opposites are not attracting, if so then the two poles would be at the center rather than at the ends. Cut a magnet a
billion times and
one side still has CW spin and the opposite still has CCW spin. The magneto-dielectric comprehension of a “magnets”
‘mechanics’ is
simplex, but not simple to the brainwashed minds of most who grew up with misconceptions about what a magnet IS and how
it
works.

If the atom were 99.999999% empty space as the priests of the cult of quantum advocate, then their non-existent
electrons would
spiral into the nucleus. All atoms, as is necessary to understanding the magnet itself, are multifaceted ‘balloons’ with
magnetic and
dielectric charges throughout. There isn’t even .00000000001% of ‘empty space’ in the atomic structure. To believe in
quantum is just
placing false beliefs based upon nothing, this is CNAP (convoluted nonsense and poppycock).

Why do certain heavy elements have small volume geometry and certain lightweight elements have enormous volumes? Because
neutrons are dielectrically dominant and counterspatial by nature. (discussed further on)

That positive charges terminates in the negative terminal doesn’t mean that negative attracts the positive terminal.
This is another
reason that reification of electrons as entities does not exist.

Magnetism is Ether in preturbative movement however the polarity of same is a perceptive error, this binary is spatial
vortex
movement into itself, so deemed the “negative pole”

**The laser analogy**

_“If someone were to ask what is the_ **_most simple explanation of what a permanent magnet really is_** _, the answer
is that it is a coherent
binary field object; or one might easily declare a permanent magnet a ‘field ‘laser’’_**_. - Author_**

Whether by magnetic induction causing dielectric coherency from a magnet to an “unmagnetized” (as really meant
inter-atomically
incoherent random dielectric inertia) soft iron piece, or a charge dump from a capacitor bank to a ‘magnetizer coil’ (an
incorrect
designation) thru a ferrite magnet or neo magnet, the resultant is the same with respect of difference in increased
capacitance, and that
difference is F.I. or field incommensurability.

**The conventional logic in speaking of “aligned domains” is meaningless nonsense, while descriptively accurate, is
explicatively
absurd and senseless nonsense.** What is and does occur is the ordered inter-atomic coherency of dielectricity and the
resultant macro-
magnetic phenomena which is therefore called a “magnet”. However all magnetism is a posterior resultant to a prior which
is
dielectric coherency.

Without taking the analogy too far, we can state, for clarifications sake, **that a “magnet” is a field ‘laser’** ,
within which the
incommensurate conjugated inter-atomic magneto-dielectricity is coherent throughout the object we call a ‘magnet’,
resultantly
achieved by charge dump from a capacitor bank thru a charging coil into the pre-‘magnet’ or by magnetic induction of a
magnet to a
soft iron object.

This dielectric coherency and alignment is necessitated as dielectricity and magnetism are mutually repellant Ether
modalities, one
with inertia, the other the resultant spatial vectorization of dielectricity in loss of inertia.

Ultimately building dielectric coherency in a diode, or HeNe laser, or at the inter-atomic magneto-dielectric of iron or
Neo-iron-boron
is fundamentally no different. In both cases the conjugate nature of dielectricity and magnetism (in the case of the
laser, the transverse
magnetic component of the radial dielectric nature of light) are brought into mutual coherency and point non-specific
self-similarity.
In both cases we have a mutual spin-deflection from applied charge or an applied field which causes field alignment of
the dielectric
component resultant to an applied charge or induction from applied magnetic field. In which case as regards both
examples, dielectric
inertia is brought into coherent concentration which then produces resultant macro-magnetic phenomena. In the case of
the laser, we
have resultant coherent radial dielectric light emission.

One must apply concentrated logical thought to the nature of an applied magnetic field to a soft iron object in which
case **the inter-
atomic dielectric becomes coherent by presenting it centripetal circumference to the applied magnetic field.** We know
that
magnetism and dielectricity exist always 180 degrees from each other even in a magnet where it is APPARENTLY (only so)
90
degrees. This ‘dielectric presentation’ to the applied magnetic field in presenting its centripetal circumference to the
magnetism
maintains Ether conservation of the dielectric inertia.

Dielectricity maintains its inertia one of two ways in coherency from an applied external (or internal) magnetic field
from another,
either by presenting its centripetal circumference or thru (in the case of the magnet) gyromagnetic precession wherein
which
magnetism is mediated in and thru the binding system we know as the “magnet”.

**Below: Conventional HeNe tube laser within which the emission end contains a 95% mirror and the rearward oriented full
reflectance 100% mirror, or ‘back mirror’. The HeNe is the gain medium which builds near instant coherency from applied
charge. As is known, a 30-watt light bulb (incoherent) is worthless, whereas a 30-watt laser (coherent light) will burn
a hole in
you. This intense reflectance builds coherent parallel radial dielectric capacitance which is only blocked by the
transverse
electromagnetic components of light.**

**Magnetism continued II**

Magnetism radiates and thereby creates space within this radiative field, but only spatially unto itself, an Ether
bubble brought into
being from coherent macro-magnetic amplification. Neither magnetism nor dielectricity can terminate in space, but only
on
themselves or into counterspatial conductive terminals.

Magnetism not only moves 180 from the dielectric but also from the magnetic as the “poles” vortex thru and away from
each other.
The real ‘secret’ of magnetism is that the dielectric is attracting the dielectric by centrifugal and centripetal
spatial reciprocation of the
magnetic. Field incommensurability is extremely simplex, but not simple, and unknown to people who do not ever think in
terms of
fields or pressure gradient equalizations. We just are not taught such things.

The dielectric and magnetic are two opposed fields occupying the same sphere when in equilibrium, they are not ‘seen’
when
electrified, the dielectric field is amplified and causes macro-magnetic preponderances.

Pyrolytic graphite placed over a magnet, from either side of the magnet if you drag the graphite CW over the magnet the
graphite goes
CCW and if you drag the graphite suspended in water CCW over the mag, the graphite goes CW.

necessity
dictate them to be.**

Magnetic Inductance is a polarized dimensional relation for the magnetic modalities of appearances (so to say) of the
Ether, and
Dielectric Capacitance is thus a non-dimensional inertial relation for the dielectric modalities of the Ether. For the
magnetic induction
the Ether modality is known as the magnetic permeability, for the dielectric induction the Ether modality is known as
the dielectric
permittivity.

Magnetism is by nature the rotary polarized terminus of electricity, a waste product and necessitated conjugate terminal
of charge-
discharge terminals of natural electrical inertia and momentum. Dielectricity is electropositive, and magnetism is
electronegative,
magnetism is centrifugal and electricity is centripetal towards the nucleus. A magnetic mass has a higher dielectric
charge because its
inter-atomic dielectric volume has decreased from electrification. Remember the smaller the space, the more dielectric
capacitance

Humanities wrong conception of magnetism as the ‘attractive’ or positive force is of course fundamentally a huge error.
This error is
tied to every meaning of the very word “magnet” and “magnetism”. The universal connotation is 180 degrees from the
physical
denotation of what magnetism really is and does, what causes it, and what sustains it.

Magnetism is dimensional, the dielectric is intradimensional, or in counterspace, and only when these two Ether fields
move against
each other over time is there electrification, which is the Ether in a modality of dynamic polarization.

Anything at rest doesn’t exist. Aether in its natural state is counterspace, is rest, but declared not to exist because
it has no appearance
other than as associated with dynamic fields (all fields). The only subject ever to be at rest is the Ether when not in
perturbation, hence
the “unmoved Mover”.

This law (Newton) was written to fit non-existent premises which were mistakenly presumed to exist. A body cannot
continue its state
of rest because bodies at rest do not exist in Nature. Bodies are only the waveforms of motion. When all motion ceases,
so too do the
masses themselves. One might as appropriately refer to sound being at rest in silence, but of course this is absurd,
since the absence of
sound is not a modality of sound, but its utter voidance.

A stationary (so presumed) magnetic field needs a continuous stable inertial, a dielectrically charged inter-atomic
geometry which can
maintain its stasis, for the magnetic current to remain stationary, in equilibrium.

Every atomic and inter-atomic (as meant the magneto-dielectric volume and nucleus) must first be wound up like a watch
by
centripetal electrification before it can terminate in an ever unwinding fashion as meaning the appearance of
macro-magnetic
polarization, the spatial ‘unwinding’ of centrifugal-centripetal reciprocation. In taking a string of small sphere
magnets and looping
them into a circle, any child would notice that this greatly reduces their magnetic acceleration towards common iron for
magnetic
induction. This is every “pole” of each sphere terminating immediately back into counterspace, the loop of polarization
has itself been
looped into voidance by directing the polarization of inverse spin (due to extension as space = polarization by
definition) into and
upon itself, thereby terminating polarization before it can reach out (very little) spatially.

Two children cannot move while they are in balance with their fulcrum on a see-saw, since motion is, macro-atomically
impossible
when there is equilibrium inter-atomically. The division of balance in the creation of a “magnet” is due to the
electrification causing
high dielectric inter-atomic capacitance in the “magnetic mass” which is the dielectric object in true. The atom is
always in movement
even when there is magneto-dielectric equilibrium.
Imagine two kids on a see-saw spinning around parallel to the ground just over a fence, you cannot see them, since they
both rest
just below the fence line (inter-atomic volume), this spinning cannot be stopped, ever, since matter, atoms are by
definition motion,
there are no 0-rest mass particles in the universe. Looking edge on, these two children are spinning so fast one only
see a singular
mass, a blur (if you were to look ‘over the fence’ into this atom), but nothing is visible from behind the fence. Now
replace one child
with a much fatter one, the spinning around the fulcrum, or nucleus cannot stop, ever (however ultimately all matter
terminates given
enough time), but now one child is raised above the fence line, the skinnier child as it loops round and round. This is
how a magnet is
created, the “fatter child” representing electrification terminating in the dielectric inter-atomic of the
mageto-dielectric volume of the
atom (the supposed ‘empty space’ of GR and QM insanity). Humans in their ignorance see only the skinny child, the
magnetism
looping round and round above the fence line (macro-magnetism, or the ‘magic’ of what has fascinated everyone about
magnets for so
long), but which humans have not, cannot, still do NOT see is the fat child of dielectric inertial capacitance that is
driving the entire
mechanism we wrongly see as a “magnetic” phenomena. That science has dedicated LESS THAN a single line, a footnote of a
footnote to the “Bloch wall”, the magnetic “domain wall” is proof 100% positive that (among other reasons too numerous
to count)
humans in no way understand what magnetism really is, what is driving it, what created it, how it is maintained.

Motion is impossible in an absolute equilibrium. Balance must be divided into unbalanced opposite pairs before motion
becomes
possible ferrous or ferrous compounds (neodymium iron boron) electrification is of course that unbalance

Neither pole is attracted to or repelled by the other. Or, one might as reasonably and insanely assert that houses and
trees which are
being sucked into the cone of a tornado are attracted by the air itself, the wind rather than by the motion of the wind.
The “magnet”, or
electrified dielectric mass which it properly should be called, does to the iron filings exactly what the tornado does
to the houses and
trees. The field of magnetism is an inertial polarized terminus of electrification. In making an analogy of a
pre-magnetic mass as being
equal to the “air” of our tornado, why then does this lifeless lump not accelerate towards iron, or pick up enormous
weights? Churning
up that “air” into polarized circulation from electrification creating a dielectric inertial plane dynamo out of the now
“magnet” is the
prime mover of one field conjugating the expulsion of another field. Imagine a electrical lab stirrer, you turn on the
power
(electrification), which turns a magnet (the dielectricity in this analogy!) that spins the liquid (magnetism) inside
the glass jar (physical
magnet).
Since a magnet is inter-atomically dielectrically charged in creating a powerful inertial counterspatial centripetal
plane, which,
definitionally resists change, this “lab stirrer” of ours, the “magnet”, continues to stir AFTER the electrification, or
power has been
turned off due to the magneto-dielectrical ‘elasticity’ of iron and iron crystalline compounds (neodymium magnets), just
like
squeezing a ball of clay around its radius (squeezing = electrification, the constriction = dielectric inertial
counterspatial plane) will
create a permanent dumbbell formation. Our pre-“magnet” lump has been magneto-dielectrically ‘squeezed’ into this
formation. There
is nothing “in a magnet” that makes it a magnet; everything is field pressures in nature. Everything. There is nothing
pre-“magnet” of
the mass, or post-“magnet” of the mass repelling, accelerating, only Ether field pressures.
This is, again, the 800-pound gorilla the cult of quantum and GR and their priests find impossible to understand,
explain, and
outright deny. Obviously that the conjugate fields are coincident to and of the “magnetic” mass is not in doubt, but
ultimately we are
speaking of two holes in the Ether-membrane of counterspace where one empties into (dielectric, centripetal) and another
‘pours from’
itself from both ‘ends’ only to run around to the other side of this same portal and return. That portal, in the analogy
of the circulating
polarized magnetism, is a portal of dielectricity. All centrifugal field movements are centripetal movements in spatial
extension. All
fields are Ether modalities, with no exceptions.

**Below: Lab stirrer analogy of creating a magnet by electrification and inducing dielectric capacitance into the
magneto-
dielectric ‘elasticity’ of the iron or iron compound with resultant conjugate macro-magnetic expulsion from the
inter-atomic
volume as amplified by countless trillions of atoms in coherency expelling magnetism. The magnet is in reality a
macro-model
of the micro-inter-atomic pressure geometries at play between dielectricity and magnetism after electrification. The
rest-‘level’
of the magnet is pre-electrification in which the pre-‘magnet’ mass is in geometric equilibrium at the inter-atomic
volume. In
changing this equilibrium (again, a permanent magnet is stable) the ‘water’ of magnetism is centrifugally expelled (not
repelled) from the surface of the physical, now-electrified “magnet” which is really a supra-dielectric object.**

While magnetism and dielectricity are conjugate and reciprocal to each other in a state of equilibrium (even the
permanent magnet is
an ‘equilibrium’ by nature of it being a permanent magnet however its magneto-dielectric geometry has been altered into
a stable
distension) it is the case that magnetism is polarized and spatial, and dielectricity is a centripetal radial
counterspatial inertial plane;
likewise therefore the magnetic field is many thousands of times ‘larger’ in volume (=space) than the positive
generative dielectric
field, though both their potentials are equal in a stabilized system

When “opposite poles” (a fallacy of perception) cancel each other out in counterspace, the meeting of CW on CCW or CCW
on CW is
the dielectric Ether membrane causing (cancelling) magnetic polarization by voidance. The logic of counterspace, it
seems to the
ordinary mind almost insane, but bringing N on S or S on N is like emptying a fountain with a hoop or membrane with no
spatial
component. Empty a ‘hole in space’ with another hole, laughingly. However as mentioned there is no Ether in space, only
space
within the Ether when Ether modalities are manifest, as electricity, dielectricity, magnetism, mass-matter and its
attributional gravity
field which is also, like dielectricity, centripetal. There is another field entirely that nobody knows about, at least
not conventionally as
a ‘field’, but that will be saved for another article.

When the so-called positive pole of a magnet is brought into contact with the so-called (wrongly) negative pole of
another magnet,
that effect which we think of as attraction is one of centripetal counterspatial voidance. As any will note, the
dielectric plane re-centers
itself between two magnets brought together. This voidance is the utter oppositional power to manifest polarity and the
voidance of
magnetism at that locus. Just as weight is location and medium specific, so too are magnetic gauss fields location (
magnetic velocity)

and medium (dielectric voidance into counterspace). Polarization ceases at the point of counterspatial voidance. As has
been said
elsewhere, if ‘opposite poles’ were self-attractive, then magnetism would be at the center of the magnet rather than at
the spatial
surface of the ends of a magnet.

Ultimately there are no magnetic ‘lines of force’, all are merely Ether pressure gradients, pure and simple.
Electricity, dielectricity are
not ‘separate forces’ or substances, rather different modalities of the Ether in motion, in circulation, centripetal,
centrifugal, or both,
linear, longitudinal, transverse, radial, spatial, and counterspatial.

**Below: Both pictures are the same, as seen with different mediums of demonstration. However this is only the view of a
SINGLE VECTOR of divergent centrifugal magnetism and its convergence on the other side convergently and centripetally.**

**Below: P1 and P2 stand for pole 1 and pole 2. D = divergence, C = convergence. FM = field movement. AM = apparent (
unreal
movement) movement. Both sets of pictures are the same, as seen from slightly different angles of the poles. However
this is
only the view of a SINGLE VECTOR of divergent centrifugal magnetism and its convergence on the other side convergently
and centripetally. Inverse and interlaced superimposition of the pictures below would be necessary to show the identical
but
reverse polarity and its reciprocation. Blue arrows demonstrate the divergent vector becoming the red arrows of
convergence.
As the arrows indicate, spatial polarity is indeed both extremely simplex and at the same time extremely complicated
perceptually, and add to this the necessity to demonstrate a magnet, this must be inverted and doubled to show the
complete
picture. All field movement is relative to the inverse polarized field opposite; but as is the case, both sides (not
shown below)
moving divergently appear, relative from either side opposite, but from each side alone, appear to be moving in the same
direction. This is where all antinomies and opposites in the universe begin.**

**Magnetic attraction absolutely does not exist whatsoever. Forwarding the seemingly impossible but**

**hyper-logical fact, which is evidenced by all observed phenomena, and understanding of the fundamental**

**forces.**

**Below: Almost nothing is more primitive (and wrong) in the minds of men than that of ‘magnetic attraction’. Only a few
things are more primeval within the human consciousness than this, like the drive to reproduce, eat, and self-defense.
No
radiation of any variety can or may be permitted to attract anything. Such nonsense does not exist.**

Radiation attracts nothing, never. It displaces dielectricity, and causes inductive coherency of the charge-state
structure of the ferrous
(or diamagnetic, or otherwise) object, which resultantly accelerates towards the inductive force (in the voidance of
space) of
counterspatial dielectric voidance, or what is conventionally and incorrectly deemed ‘attraction’.

There is utterly no such thing as magnetic attraction; all acceleration (specifically movement) is dielectric voidance
due to inertial
coherency. Magnetism / radiation does not attract radiation, all such attraction or repulsion is dielectric voidance or
counter voidance.
Like on like polarity (space) is oppositional to dielectricity impetus for voiding the motional attribute of space.

What you yourself and everyone else refers to as “magnetic attraction” in fact is dielectric counterspatial voidance. It
is as ancient as
dirt (sic) as pertains the premise of the loadstone causing, from rest, acceleration of iron bits, nails etc. to the
loadstone. As such there
is very little in the world most deeply ingrained, and additionally, more wrong. The very term magic comes from the word
for magnet.
This ‘invisible attraction’, so deemed magnetism, and therefore “magnetic attraction” is an error, a perceptual defect
and flaw; worse
still, so-called ‘experts’ in academia, great regurgitators of well-established nonsense persist in spreading this
outright falsehood.

Just like AC lines more voltage, the more dielectricity attraction (voidance) and the more the AC lines come together,
this is dielectric
voidance. Dielectric voidance is due to the dielectricity wanting to come into tighter counterspatial stasis, as is its
nature. What others
incorrectly call "magnetic attraction", is dielectric voidance. Dielectricity by nature is counterspatial and repelled
by magnetic spatial
fields, polarization, i.e. space itself which is definitionally movement in attributional creation from divergent
magnetic fields.

Magnets (and AC lines) repel due to magnetism. The more magnetism in the AC lines the more it wants to push the wires
apart, this
is what is incorrectly thought of as "magnetic repulsion". It is dielectric counter-voidance.

What is 'reaching out' between objects, obviously so, is magnetism, however dielectric coherency and resultant
acceleration cannot be
said to be "magnetic attraction" rather resultant acceleration OF dielectric to dielectric due to magnetic displacement
and induction of
the object which accelerates to the so-called "magnet".

All phenomena affected by magnetism “at a distance” (which is not the case, since centrifugal polarized fields are
already overlapping
the affected medium or object), be it paramagnetic or diamagnetic is resultantly initiating dielectric coherency and
movement into
dielectric voidance, or dielectric repulsion (countervoidance, i.e. diamagnetic), as is the case with bismuth where the
dielectric inertia
is so high, and the magnetic reluctivity so high (also = extremely low magnetic permeability) that there is low
reluctivity for polarized
magnetic field permeability into the system or medium.

It is absolutely logical from the point of dielectric voidance and countervoidance to speak of any and all magnets as
both “strongly
diamagnetic and strongly paramagnetic”. The effect known as ‘magnetic repulsion’ is governed by the fact of inverse
dielectric
voidance at which, rather than spatial voidance, there is space and movement introduced (like on like pole, N on N, or S
on S) in
which case it is accurate to say, that in this polarized configuration, there is extremely strong diamagnetic
countervoidance
(‘repulsion’) occurring; and likewise inverse to this scenario, (N on S, etc.) extremely strong paramagnetic voidance.

**Diamagnetic bismuth’s missing secret, and magnetic ‘levitation’ perfected using a ‘programmed’**

**bismuth discovery.**

_For the magnetic induction the Etheric relation is known as the magnetic “Permeability”, for the dielectric induction
the Etheric
relation is known as the dielectric “Permittivity”._ **_– Eric P. Dollard_**

Bismuth sits at a golden ratio ‘seat’ on the periodic table, its dielectric inertia is so high, that its atomic radius
of 143 is less than
that of lightweight titanium which is 176, and less still the heavier polonium 190 and lead 154. It sits immediately
between extremely
toxic lead and thallium on one side, and extremely radioactive, extremely short-lived, astronomically rare and virtually
non-existent
polonium and astatine on the other side, of which less than 100 grams per year of polonium are created, and only created
resultant to
bombardment of bismuth with high energy protons and neutrons. While virtually four times the atomic mass of iron, it has
an atomic
radius of 143 to irons 156. Bismuth like glass is a dielectric capacitor, however in the case of bismuth, it is
extremely stable and resists
ALL discharge to an extremely high degree, which is why its electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity are
extremely low.
However, as proven in nuclear reactor coolant use, its dielectric conductivity is nearly transparent. Neutrons are
dielectrically
dominant. Likewise this is why bismuth absorbs high energy gamma rays but allows the passage of neutrons.
Since this is a book on magnetism, why such a detailed focus on bismuth? Because bismuth is diamagnetic for the very
same
reason that the dielectric inertial plane of the “magnet” is anti-magnetic, is focused at, is forced at the centerpoint
between polarities,
not located at. Bismuth has just enough (very little) magnetism to maintain its spatial existence, which is also why its
atomic radius is
so low. One bit more of magnetism from an additional proton throws bismuth into chaos and hell as polonium. Bismuth
cannot be
polarized, it is the very least possible element to lose dielectric inertia in its atoms. This is extremely important
beyond belief. There
are unrealized properties of bismuth yet to be discovered. Bismuths actual polarization is not polarization but turning
it into polonium
by attacking its nucleus; this however isn’t polarization, but the creation of a radioactive and dangerous lethal beast.

**Below: Natures perfect example of dielectric inertia as represented in these anti-cube, or hypercube formation of
bismuth
crystalline formation. Pure bismuth under ideal conditions will easily reveal its nature; however horribly sad and odd
that
humanity has not grasped this glaring fact until now stated. While this is a book about magnetism, magnetism’s initiator
is
dielectricity, which is counterspatial, radial, inertial, centripetal, and below you see a near perfect example of this
expressed by
pure bismuth crystalline formation. You cannot grasp magnetism without grasping dielectric inertia.**

We must not speak about bismuth being ‘diamagnetic’, which it is, however it repels only centrifugal magnetism, not
centripetal
dielectricity. Bismuths primary property is its incredibly high dielectric inertia, like a gyroscope spinning so
incredibly fast that only
destroying its nucleus will greatly alter its properties. This, until this writing, missing secret of bismuth will yield
incredible invention
in the very near future, at which time the price of bismuth will skyrocket. Given enough enormous dielectric charge
applied to bismuth
will create a hyperstate property of pure bismuth element with astounding level attributes and effects. In a simplex but
obtuse
explanation, **bismuth is a dielectric dynamo, its own incredibly powerful dielectric inertia-well which contains yet
unrealized
enormous, enormous kinetic energy potential. Likewise with enough proton bombardment and incredibly powerful
electrostatic charge, bismuth, by all calculations should be a nucleal-kinetic energy device with magnitudes higher
energy
output than input.**

**Below: Lead and its genitor in radiative depletion, is Uranium; likewise the same for Plutonium which passes thru
polonium
into lead. However only Neptunium depletes into the heaviest stable element, bismuth. Uranium and Neptunium are the two
primordial radioactive heavy elements of the universe; however Neptunium the far more rare in occurrence. Likewise the 9
parts per billion of bismuth is testament to this fact.**

**Below: One proton separates heaven from hell, bismuth on the left and on the right, polonium. Stable bismuth with a
half life
of 20 billion billion years, non-toxic, safe, and the extra proton of polonium throws bismuth’s dielectric inertia into
chaos,
(which is how polonium is created, by bombarding bismuth) so out of harmony that it becomes an extremely lethal tool of
assassination and a short-lived deadly radioactive element where a millionth of a gram becomes fatal; likewise polonium
is the
initiator and nuclear trigger, along with beryllium, of an atomic bomb. There is a golden ratio balance between the
protons
and neutrons in Bismuth that will not ACCECPT A SINGLE ADDITIONAL PROTON without absolute chaos ensuing. This
along with other evidentiary properties proves that bismuth has absolute dielectric inertia saturation, which explains
its
properties, explains its crystalline growth, explains its incredibly unstable nature when a mere single proton is added,
explains
its high diamagnetism. Dielectric inertia repels magnetism, pure and simple. Further below, bismuths spectrum absorption
and emission has been a point of great study since it has dualistic properties dependent upon crystallization. Bismuth
literally
exists in a quasi-state of gravitational and inter-atomic spatial existence with inconsistent spectra emission and
absorptions.**

**Bismuth is the HEAVIEST STABLE ELEMENT that exists in the universe**. Everything else is unstable, radioactive and
typically highly toxic, not to mention thallium and lead just below bismuth, it has an atomic weight of 209, although it
has the atomic
number 83. If you subtract the number of protons (83) from the number 209 (the atomic weight) you get 126. That is the
exact number
of neutrons in the bismuth atom. Since protons are magnetically dominant, merely adding one proton to bismuth to create
polonium
creates both an incredibly lethal, short lived, toxic and radioactive element that virtually does not exist in nature.
Polonium when

inhaled or swallowed takes merely on millionth of a gram to be lethal. This is the very methodology used by Putin to
murder
Alexander Litvinenko. The Nuclear Gravitation Field Theory has to its premise that the “Strong Nuclear Force” and
Dielectricity/
Gravity are one and the same force. Bismuth crystals grow extremely fast for a reason.

Typical investigation will not divulge the relative picture of bismuth, and its special ‘seat’ on the periodic table,
being so unlike its
neighbors. Resting between extremely toxic and incredibly rare and radioactive polonium with a mere handful of days of
half life, and
astatine with a mere 8 hour half life, bismuth is so stable that its half life is 20 billion billion years, infinitely
longer than the calculated
age of the universe, however this conclusion is spurious, since bismuth is entirely stable. Additionally, sitting on the
periodic table,
stable, non-toxic in its pure form, and so incredibly non-radioactive it is virtually inert denotatively, it rests
between both the extreme
incredible toxicity of lead and thallium, and the incredibly rare and worse still dangerous and unstable radioactive
polonium and
astatine. Thallium is so deadly, mere handling proves fatal and it was at one time used as a poisoning agent of animals
and of
murderers. Literally in the middle of hell and worse hell, is a safe and stable element with incredible dielectric
properties some
characteristics only recently being uncovered, one of which by myself in experimentation. Resultant to bismuths high
dielectric
inertia, it logically has extremely low magnetic permeability. All magnetic reluctivity is based upon dielectric
inertia, a repulsion and
resistance to magnetic field ‘breaking’ of inertia. Magnetism itself, being the dielectric field in discharge is
definitionally a loss of
Ether-inertia and represents the Ether-modality of magnetism, but denotatively this is the spatial vectorization of
dielectricity due to its
discharge /loss of inertia.

**Below: On left, using my ‘programmed’ bismuth disk. Single disk levitation of 3mm N45 cube neodymium with 1” cube N50

inches above. On right identical setup using standard bismuth ‘non-programmed’ disk with same lifter magnet, with
resultant
much lower levitation. This is a wholly new discovery of bismuth casting with applied charge and field in casting.**

That bismuth is the only room temperature extremely diamagnetic element has gone over the heads of most people in its
level of
importance. Bismuth shrinks on melting, and expands on cooling, but its dielectric inertia resists any spatial
divergence and likewise
therefore grows hypercube crystals and forms golden ratio patterns of convergence when cast in convex formations. Any
element or
supercooled ceramic that becomes diamagnetic resultantly; it is the case that these objects have extremely high
diamagnetism due to
extremely high dielectric inertia, a low spatial footprint, and extremely low (the same thing ultimately) magnetic
profiles. This is the
reason for the very low atomic radius of bismuth, the reason for its attributes, the reason for its unique crystalline
growth, the reason
for its extremely high resistance to current and thermal conductivity.

**Below: Beautiful Bismuth crystal grown by “Bismuth and Beyond” (bowers998 EBay).**

Likewise this property is seen in incorrectly deemed “superconductive” ceramics wherein which, under extreme cold the
material
obtains a super-state with an extremely small spatial (=magnetic) footprint which is filled by external magnetism
causing them to act
as one object regardless of the spaces between them, which are unreal to begin with. Fields mediate fields, and make no
concessions
or concerns for physical objective boundaries.
Artificially high dielectric inertia achieved in ceramics due to supercooling is naturally present in bismuth. The
importance of this
attribute has yet to be realized by the world. Likewise as I have discovered, the sandwiching of bismuth between layers
of strong
divergent magnetic layers has fascinating phenomena. That bismuth is the universe’s most heavy stable element with
extremely stable
properties and incredibly high dielectric inertia as seen in many of its attributes including its crystalline growth,
means that bismuth in
its liquid state is highly susceptible to gravimetric and magnetic influences of either voidance of countervoidance.
Bismuth is literally
an element possessing a high ‘urge’ to collapse itself into dielectric counterspace. This special property has yet to be
exploited.

**Below: On left, standard bismuth castings I built for superior magnetic levitation with greater stability which, using
convex
castings creates better stability to conform with the magnetic field geometry of both the lifter magnet and the
levitator magnet
(3mm small cube) as pictured on right.**

**Two examples of dielectric inertia**

_“All inherent inertia is centripetal, there are no exceptions; all centrifugal presumed inertia is not inherent and a
resultant effect and
only connotatively inertia, but not inertia definitionally”_ **_– Author_**

It has been unknown until now how normally cubic forming pyrite (iron) ‘dollar’ or ‘pyrite sun’ formations occur as
found inside
anthracite coal layers. Iron having both potential for magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity can concentrate
either and
likewise therefore can form either high dielectrically radiant disk ‘star’ formations just as bismuth naturally does in
a matter of a
second upon cooling, or the iron can grow magnetic spatial cubes in formation depending upon the influences upon it in
growth. Pyrite
(iron) ‘dollars’ are the resultant of being grown under high dielectric inertia within tons of diamagnetic anthracite
coal.

**Below: Left is a pyrite dollar or “sun” in anthracite coal shale which is nearly 100% dielectric carbon which
concentrates this
dielectricity in formation in iron sulfide with both high dielectric permetivity and magnetic permeability. Rather than
forming
cubes or dodecahedrons these iron formations have grown under high dielectric coercion from millions of tons of
surrounding
dielectric carbon. On the right 99.99% pure bismuth naturally grown exactly like a “pyrite sun” on its own. Bismuth is,
as we
have much talked about, has the highest dielectric inertia of any element.**

**Below: Left picture is pyrite ‘dollar’ in its native anthracite coal shale which is diamagnetic carbon. On right
identical dual
pyrite ‘dollar’ formation intersecting at the known 1/Phi^-2 (.381966) and Phi (1.618033).**

**All heavy element roads terminate into lead, but only Neptunium ends in bismuth**

**Below: Left is a 1-pound ingot of pure 99.99% bismuth. On right is a two-piece cast experiment in pure bismuth. There
is a
‘secret’ in the picture on the right that is wholly unrelated to the flash angle of the photograph taken. Both pieces of
that image
are pure bismuth.**

**Rarity:
Very common: LEAD** = 14 parts per million in the earths crust. **COPPER** = 60 parts per million in the earths curst.
**Moderately rare: SILVER** = 75 parts per billion.
**Extremely rare: BISMUTH** = 9 parts per billion. **GOLD** = 4 parts per billion. **PLATINUM** = 5 parts per billion.

**All indications are that bismuth does not exist natively whatsoever rather is the end product of depleted Neptunium**.
likewise is the case that most lead is depleted uranium. Additionally current plentiful presence of uranium with
virtually non-existent
Neptunium is further indication of this. Neptunium eventually decays to form bismuth-209, unlike most other common heavy
nuclei
which decay into lead isotopes. Unlike most metals bismuth expands on cooling from its molten state. It is no
coincidence nor
anything other than perfectly logical that the first transuranic element, Neptunium degrades into the LAST heavy stable
element,
bismuth.

**Below: Neptunium on the left and bismuth on the right. A loss of 10 protons and 18 neutrons is the termination into
the most
heavy stable element that exists.**

There are 81 stable elements in total. There are 83 elements, however, if we take out the unnatural elements, 43
technetium, and 61
promethium, because they do not occur in nature, we are left with 81 stable elements. One of these elements is hydrogen,
the first in
the Periodic Table, with an atomic number of 1. If we leave aside hydrogen we are left with 80 elements.
While you can read that “bismuth has a half-life of roughly 19,000,000,000,000,000,000 years”, this is based upon a
spurious test.
What is fact is happening is a few stray neutrons exist in a very few atoms of bismuth of any grade, and this small bit
is that of
bismuth-210, which decays into polonium 210; polonium 210 is a very strong alpha particle emitter. Likewise there could
be a very
few atoms of polonium 209 with a half life of 102 years that are in the samples which decays into lead 205 via alpha
radiation which
was detected. Polonium is virtually non-existent in nature and one can more accurately call it a hyper-state of bismuth
than innumerate
polonium as a wholly different element.
As for the defunct experiment, the equipment used by the Orsay team consists of two “heat and light” detectors that are
enclosed in
a reflecting cavity and cooled to 20mk. The first detector- containing bismuth-209, germanium and oxygen – undergoes a
slight
temperature rise when it absorbs an alpha particle. This temperature change is measured in the form of a voltage pulse
whose

amplitude is directly proportional to the energy released. The second detector, made from a thin disk of germanium,
registers the light
flashes from alpha-particle events.
The team performed two measurements, one with 31 grams of bismuth in the detector and the other with 62 grams. The
scientists
registered 128 alpha-particle events over 5 days and found an unexpected line in the spectrum at 3.14 MeV - now
attributed to
bismuth-209 decay. The half-life was calculated to be (1.9 +/- 0.2 ) x 10^19 years, however this conclusion was based
upon a false
premise and understanding.
Henry Moseley's experiments [using X rays] demonstrated that what distinguishes one element from another is its atomic
number,
the number of protons in the nucleus of its atoms, not its atomic weight, which is a measure of the total number of
protons and
neutrons in the nucleus. The correct way of ordering the elements in the periodic table was, therefore, by their atomic
number, and not,
as Mendeleyev had thought, by their atomic weight. As for bismuth, it is stable with 43 extra neutrons, but with 42 or
44 neutrons it is
unstable. This key point as per diamagnetism and stability cannot be overlooked. Bismuth also exhibits overunity since
its 209 nucleus
has a higher energy state that the sum of its components, which would be of thallium 205 and helium-4 nucleus. Meaning
bismuth
breaks the rule of conservation.
The thorium series begins with thorium-232 and ends with the stable nuclide lead-208. The neptunium series is named for
its
longest-lived member, neptunium-237; it ends with bismuth-209. The uranium series begins with uranium-238 and ends with
lead-

206. The actinium series, named for its first-discovered member, actinium-227, begins with uranium-235 and ends with
     lead-207.
     **Meaning ‘all roads end in lead’, except for neptunium which ends in bismuth!** From this we can deduce that of
     lead we know it is
     naturally very abundant however almost all of it is the product of long-term uranium depletion; whereas neptunium
     is the only element
     that degrades into a non-toxic hyper-stable element, bismuth which is likewise on part with gold and platinum in
     rarity. Uranium
     degrades into lead, and neptunium into bismuth. Both neptunium and bismuth are extremely rare, all natively
     existent neptunium that
     was present at the formation of the earth has since degraded into bismuth, that it exists alongside lead in mining
     is no coincidence
     since neptunium is found alongside uranium as well naturally however it is extremely rare. The universe’s rarest
     heavy unstable
     element degrades into the universe’s rarest and most heavy stable element bismuth.

**Below: Thorium decay series, Uranium (dual) decay series, and lastly the neptunium radioactive decay series which
terminates
into bismuth.**

**Below: Anti-cubes, hypercubes, and counterspatial dielectric inertia formations.**

**Below: Left, space, and middle counterspace, not ‘warped space’ ala Einstein who, in stupidity reified space as
something,
rather counterspace. “Since action and reaction are coexistent, it follows that the supposed curvature of space (ala
Einstein) is

stating
that something can act upon nothing” – Nikola Tesla. Far right is an inertial anti-cube in which decreasing dielectric
inertia is

Ultimately I have spoken much about polarization, i.e. space, and likewise dielectric inertia, or counterspace. But do
we have any
stark examples of this in nature? The answer is many, yes. Taking the element most prone to spatial polarization (
remembering that
space = 4, i.e. the cube [monas, nous, xaos, hyle]), that being iron, as contrasted with that of bismuth, with a high
neutron count
(dielectrically dominant) and the highest elemental dielectric inertia present. Both present themselves under ideal
crystalline growth,
with spatial (in the case of iron) and counterspatial (in the case of bismuth, denotatively described as ‘hopper
crystallization’, however
this is descriptive, and is not explicative!) crystalline growth.

**Below: Multiple concave bismuth castings reveal what was logically to be predicted from extremely high dielectric
inertia,
anti-growth centripetal patterns at 137.5077, 137.5077, and 85 degrees. Extremely large concave intent voids left in
material at
these specific golden ratio angles. Logically so but inverse, likewise patterns from magnetic radiation resultant from
magnetic
divergence are seen and in gyromagnetic precessional frequencies of reciprocation.**

**Below: Bismuth disk pours which always end their cooling cycle in maintaining their dielectric inertia by raising a
small bump
in the center, ever-resisting solidification and seeking counterspatial formations. Likewise you can see this as
evidenced by the
concentric shrinking circles formed in their cooling around the entire circumference.**

Obviously and logically so, bismuth the heavy stable element that it is must form spatial blobs or crystals if allowed
to cool on its
own; however if grown correcting during cooling and the excess poured off, fantastical counterspatial crystalline growth
is seen;
sometimes the forming (see pictures below) of perfect ‘anti-cubes’. This “hoppering” has not been understood until now.
It is
incorrectly stated that this formation of bismuth is due to ‘electrical attraction being higher at the edge of the
crystal growth’, but this
is absolutely not the case. This formation is appropriately to be deemed a ‘hypercube’, or counterspatial tesseract.
This growth is due
to dielectric inertia inherent to pure bismuth.

**Below: From the book ‘De Divina Proportione’ (About the divine proportions [the golden ratio]) by Luca Pacioli 1509.
The
book was illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci. On the left (SOLIDUS) you can see a cube of space, and on the right (VACUUS),
an anti-cube, a dielectric anti-cube, or counterspace, hypercube, or Ether-tesseract, or inverse-space, or
‘negative-space’.
Dielectricity is counterspace. Only two copies exist of this work. That this very illustration is from the hand of
Leonardo da
Vinci himself is no coincidence as pertains his interest in it. This work is, as yet, untranslated into English. Only
two copies
exist and thankfully it has been digitized for a future translation.**

Not only are bismuth crystals extremely fast growing (due to dielectric inertia), but their crystalline growth (from a
genuine
electro-mechanical standpoint) is perfectly understood if ones knows the conjugate nature of dielectricity and magnetism
and how
both or either can dominate a circuit, a system, or even crystalline growth wherein you have two antinomies, iron (
spatial, polarized
from induction), and its antithesis, bismuth (counterspatial, inertial, dielectric,
radial [as seen in the sharp 90 degree line and inwardly
curling formations of bismuth]). Alas and unfortunately, not until the writing of this book has someone with a full
grasp of dielectric
and magnetic theory and understanding taken an intelligent look at how magnetism and (in the case of bismuth) dielectric
inertia play
an extremely heavy role in the formation of crystalline growth. Bismuth has extremely high (the highest) dielectric
permittivity and
extremely low magnetic permeability.

**Below: Shown dielectric curling of the extremely high electrostatic inertia inherent to the nature and pure bismuth
crystalline
growth as formed in cooling crystalline growth.**

The dielectric nature of bismuth is also why bismuth has an extremely low melting point, its dielectric inertia is
already enormous
and takes a low heat to bring it to the melting point. All bismuth crystalline growth is due to counterspatial
dielectric inertia at which
(as amply demonstrated) cooling is not only from the outside in (as inertia would necessitate), but likewise and
importantly cools in a
geometric negative-space ‘stepped’ pattern, either in full anti-cubes, or partial anti-cubes which appear pyramidal.
Likewise you can
see this inward inertial ‘curling’ on virtually all bismuth crystallization. Apparently it takes a Platonic
retroductionist to tell the world
something (which to myself) that is so extremely and obnoxiously obvious that it virtually screams the ‘answer’ to its
growth matrix.

**Below: As necessitated, during cooling, counter-vortex (CW and CCW) counterspatial curlings will occur on every plane
of
cooling for molten metal trapped by cooling from forming the perfect anti-cube. This formation of inverse centripetal
curl is
both necessitated, absolutely logical and deducible by simplex comprehension of dielectric inertia (of which extremely
few are
studied in). Dielectric inertia is written about much by the great masters of electrical engineering who gave us 100% of
our
electrical system of today, that being Faraday, Maxwell, C.P. Steinmetz, Nikola Tesla, and Oliver Heaviside.**

**Below: Shown left, spatial iron-pyrite cube, in line with it magnetic polarization growth-matrix in crystallization.
Middle
picture is a dielectric counterspatial ‘anti-cube’ of bismuth, a ‘hypercube’, or counterspatial tesseract. Bismuth has
extremely
high (the highest) dielectric permittivity and extremely low magnetic permeability. Oddly, depending on how you look at
the
bismuth in the middle picture, some will see an anti-cube, and others have mistakenly thought it a pyramidal formation.
This
is typical optical phenomena of negative-space, or counterspatial phenomena. Far right, likewise without coincidence,
this is
the very same dielectric counterspatial ‘sink’ as seen on the centripetal zone of a cube (or disk or otherwise) magnet
as seen
under a ferrocell. Dielectricity always expresses itself in a counterspatial phenomena. Usually (almost always) never
recognized by the unintelligent manyfolk, the layman, who is unskilled in Euclidean geometry and Platonic logic.**

It is often stated (almost always) that “bismuth is diamagnetic”, but this is a posterior property to its dielectric
nature. Diamagnetic
properties are always posterior attributes or properties to a prior electrostatic or dielectric inertia state which
resultantly is therefore
also ‘diamagnetic’. Instead of saying “bismuth is diamagnetic” it is more accurate to fundamentally state that bismuth
is supra-
dielectric; has extremely strong dielectric inertia to the pure innate element. ‘Diamagnetic’ means nothing ultimately
as per bismuth
than as a posterior attribute to the dielectric elemental bismuth; rather it must be pointed out that the universe’s
most diamagnetic
element is only thus because it has extremely high dielectric inertia, which as we know already from the book is
centripetal,
counterspatial, and radial. Bismuth is diamagnetic resultantly, but as per bismuth we must declare its innate property
first, which is a
high neutron count and stable high-dielectric inertia element which necessitatively must form anti-cubic, counterspatial
crystalline
formations; a ‘hypercube’, or counterspatial tesseract.

**Below: Likewise again, a perfect example of spatial polarization of the innate iron cube as representative of magnetic
permeability, and its antithesis on the right, a bismuth inertial, dielectric ‘anti-cube’, representative of
counterspace and
inertia in general, as some have deemed this formation, a ‘hypercube’, or counterspatial tesseract. Literally a
dielectric anti-
cube is an inertia convergent centripetal, radial (subtractive) hypercube, whereas its antithesis, the iron cube is a
spatial,
reciprocating (additive), divergent, centrifugal cube.**

Amusingly, however absolutely true, I have just informed you the reader, and the world that bismuth has an extremely
unique set
of characteristics in that it not only contains the highest primordial Ether-modality (dielectric) concentration of
dielectricity (and
resultantly is therefore extremely diamagnetic), but that its lovely crystalline formations are counterspatial, or
anti-cubic, are negative-

space, or hyperspatial in nature. If the new-ager community catches word of this, bismuth crystals will start flying off
the shelf
resultant to this logical revelation and dielectro-crystalline discovery. Likewise that bismuth is extremely miniscule
in radioactivity,
with a half-life countless time longer than the age of the universe itself. Bismuth is estimated to have a radioactive
half-life of 20
billion-billion years, but this calculation is false.

**Below: Warped space is the product of the warped mind of Einstein, it does not exist and Nikola Tesla was right to run
it out
of town on a rail. Counterspace as per gravity is centripetal dielectric inertial acceleration, pure and simple. As per
the
Poincare’ adapted model of extreme compression charge, all matter is the product of dielectric accretions as formed in
cosmic
structures in mass, and they themselves were formed from the G.U.T. of 1/Phi^-3.**

**Below: Left, a ‘hypercube’, or counterspatial tesseract which decreases its spatial footprint in accordance with
dielectric
inertia as its cools inwards and retaining as much inertia as possible while molten. On the right, while only a partial
anti-cube,
the resultant formation. Dependent upon cooling rates and conditions, the peripheral inwards curling is the bismuths
missing
(increasingly so) attempts to retain dielectric inertia as it cools. A genuine dielectric counterspatial tesseract only
has 12 ‘anti-
facets’ or ‘anti-sides’, not 24, since several facets complete other ‘sides’ faces/facets. Whereas a spatial cube has 6
faces it only
has 4 sides necessary to delineate a cube, an ‘anti-cube’ has 12 ‘faces’ but only 1 ‘side’ that being inertia, the
dielectric Ether.
Meaning a dielectric anti-cube has twice as many ‘faces’ as a spatial cube, but only requires 1 side compared to 4 of a
cube;
implying counterspace contains both (expressed by potential of inertia in discharge, i.e. magnetism = polarization =
space)
space and counterspace (6 and 6) all contained within one ‘side’, dielectric inertia, within which the dielectric/
Ether-inertia is
complete. This line of reasoning is wholly 100% Pythagorean & Platonic logic. However the very premise of the tesseract
is
that it has 12 facets but only one apex or true ‘corner’, a counterspatial null-point, as both meant and implied the
Ether itself.
Herein we have 12 faces and 1 side of an anti-cube, and 6 faces and 4 sides of a cube, 13 total and 10 total
respectively,
however 10 and 13 are both expressed wholly by 1 (1/Phi^3, the G.U.T.). 13 is the first expression of the golden section
outside
of 10 (1,1,2,3,5,8,13), and 1 of course its first. 4 the square, and the cube (likewise of course 6), or space (
polarization) does not
exist in the golden section for good reason, space is wholly unreal, it is a radiative abstraction of charge in
discharge.**

In closing, we can say that while much descriptions existed about hoppering and bismuth hoppering, there were absolutely
no
explanations until now. As is the case of anything with inertia, especially dielectric inertia as present in a metal in
molten form, it will
retain that inertia from the lowest potential outwards to the highest inertia inwards in which it expresses its
dielectric inertia, and this
is both how and why bismuth creates counterspatial crystalline formations if allowed to form under perfect conditions.
This has been,
ineptly and wrongly, described by some as “unnatural _angular crystals”,_ but it is in reality 100% natural and
perfectly in league with
anyone who understands dielectric inertia.

The τέσσερεις ακτίνες, translated as four rays, the tesseract is the cross of and between both space (magnetism) and
counterspace
(dielectric). The first number to be absent in the golden section being the cross, or the number four. The corner of
ever cube is the
intersection of 3 lines and four the convergence or collapse of space into counterspace, or the face of space, being
four, the square, and
likewise the cube 6, the second number not to exist in the golden ratio. Counterspace defines space in discharge, or
divergence, and in
posterior space gives a referrent to counterspace in convergence, or centripetal voidance of a discharge undergoing
convergence.
Space is the divergent remainder of counterspace in loss of its inertia in distension from its Ether fulcrum at which
point we
differentiate this Ether modality as magnetism. Hence we then have 4 and 6, space (Khaos, Xaos, matter, Chaos) and
excess (6,
excessius Latin). Obviously so, all logical branches of pure Platonic metaphysics has the lowest consideration for both
excess and
Xaos, however obviously so necessitated (ananke).

**The magneto-dielectric hyperboloid, or defining field inertia vs. magnetism / space / movement**

_What is the magneto-dielectric system of the magnet? It is a magneto-dielectric hyperboloid multi-spatial system (space
and
counterspace, or as meant magnetic and dielectric) and follows the Poincare’ disk model. The hyperboloid polarized
stereographic
projection (i.e. magnetism) is =1 and = 0, likewise the dielectric disk is =0 and additionally =1. Explaining this fact
to the
conventional mind however is not an easy task. The projection is empirically real, but a 0-projection, the dielectric
inertia is
fundamentally real and 1, but has a 0 quantity factor since it is counterspatial inertia, pure potential._ **_– Author_
**

_Fundamentally it is easiest to remember the_ **_three H’s_**_. The magneto-dielectric system is a hyperboloid, which is
preceded by a
hyperbolic disk of dielectric inertia, which creates the hyperboloid formation, which is the ‘magnet’. Lastly the
reciprocating
magnetism creates a hypotrochoid (‘spirograph’-like) of divergent and convergent pressure mediation_*
*_. Hyperbolic disk_** _, the magneto-
dielectric_ **_hyperboloid_** _, and lastly the vectorized_ **_hypotrochoid_** _formation._ **_- Author_**

**_Newton's first law says: "Every body tends to continue in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line
unless it is acted
upon by an outside force"._** This statement of Newton’s is untrue however on many levels, no body of mass and matter is
ever at rest,
definitionally this is insanity to state as much. All bodies are moving curvilinear relative to one or more planes of
inertia, local,
galactic or otherwise. Field pressure mediation is not a force, nor is it ‘outside’ except in the case of divergent
magnetic fields which
have spatial vectorization as they are so defined. Likewise there exist no straight lines of motion, only spiral or
curvilinear motion
relative to a null fulcrum. Likewise further, as in the case of iron accelerating from rest in the presence of a
dielectric field of voidance
(i.e. the ‘magnet’) this is not a force at all, but a field voidance of space which is the attributional byproduct of
magnetic fields. A
physical force of pushing or pulling is wholly unrelated to field voidances or countervoidance. A field is not a force,
instantaneous
motion in dielectric voidance is not an empirical force of one body acting upon another by either contact or empirical
coercion; rather
is a field voidance of increasing movement towards dielectric inertia which is the cancelation of said movement in a
shrinking sphere
of space which is definitionally a polarized sphere of movement created from one or more spatially divergent in
creation (past tense)
magnetic field dominances. A increasingly moving body is losing inertia, never gaining it.

**Below: When the divergent hyperboloid curvature matches the disk curvature, this is the maximum magnetic divergence,
at
which point convergence begins to occur. Respective to the image on left, the right side divergence forms one
stereographic
magnetic divergent projection (clockwise), and the left side forms an inverse stereographic magnetic divergent
projection
(counterclockwise) in the other polarized spatial vectorization. Any line that passes thru the center is =1 and =0,
having both
infinite inertia and 0 radius, all outside of this is discharge and divergence, is magnetism and the creation of space.
Magnets
and magnetism operate off the infinite Ether inertia of dimensional discharge, the loss of dielectric inertia which then
becomes
the Ether modality known as magnetism. Image on right, only three infinite rays or radius can intersect the center of
dielectric
inertia, this formula is the expression of my discovery of 1/Phi^-3, wherein the necessitated loss of dielectric inertia
in
divergence = .23606 as against 1, which = Phi^3, or Phi cubed. Likewise these three rays form the Pythagorean
incommensurability of the 1-1-Phi triangle of the perfect extrapolation of inertia in discharge and mutual harmonic
conservation.**

**The loss of inertia is lost AS space, not IN space**. This extremely important principle must be grasped otherwise
nothing can be
fully comprehended. If one were to analogize this as the air within ones lungs as inherent bodily inertia ‘keeping one
going’ (alive)
being lost to a balloon in its inflation and creating space that would be a crude but accurate analogy; if this assists
in visual
comprehension then all the better. Looking into the depths of space one is looking at the discharge of mind bending
enormous
amounts of inertia in dissipation. Magnetic reciprocation ultimately reassimilates along the centripetal or dielectric
inertial plane
however this hyperboloid in dissipation creates space, the footprint or trail of inertia in loss, which is
definitionally movement. Space
is movement, which is the loss of inertia which is space. What is ‘left behind’ of divergent magnetism is movement, is
space, but this
not imply implicitly or explicitly that space is anything or has properties or is an entity with attributes to a
principle we deem as
‘space’. Ultimately this space is unwound in convergent bodies via gravity, or dielectric voidance, or centripetal
charges.

**Below: The Poincaré disc maps the point at infinity of a hyperbolic space to a circle where hyperbolic lines are
represented as
arcs of circles intersecting the Poincaré disc at 90 degrees. As we move away from the origin of a hyperbolic space, the
space
itself expands due to negative curvature (convergent centripetal magnetism) so as we reach the perimeter of the Poincaré
disc,
the scale of the space changes dramatically, subdividing into an infinite number of pieces. Lines passing through the
center of
the Poincaré disc are on circles of infinite radius and this look like straight lines. Images below bottom are the
hyperbolic
extrapolation of divergent and convergent concentric stereographic projections of magnetic radiation as per the
necessitated
reciprocation of magnetism in the loss of dielectric inertia. In more complex and accurate detail, these draw out a
hypotrochoid pattern.**

The presumed increasing movement or acceleration of these bodies or charges is the unwinding of the motion which is
space, just
as a rock thrown into the air will halt, and the space between it at the Earth is voided by unwinding the space between
them both as
expressed in increasing movement (voiding space) until voidance is met. Obviously the dielectric pressure voidance must
exceed the
movement as measured in spherical volume separating the two bodies, otherwise cancelation will not occur. Terminal
velocity, either
in the air of the earth or in the reaches of space has terminal limits of induction, either resultant to air friction or
the limits of spatial
voidance expressed by C squared. However this velocity is not applicable to longitudinal and other field modalities
which have no
spatial vectorization and are a not hostage to this rate of induction.

**Below: The hyperboloid in increasing coherency and capacitance. This is the formation of the magneto-dielectric system
of the
magnet, however its divergence is governed by the geometry of the hyperbolic disk.**

A moving body by means of charge, gravity, or dielectric voidance (between ‘magnets’) is empirically seen to be
increasing
movement in voidance but this movement is in fact actually a voidance of movement in eliminating the space between these
objects
and thereby increasing inertia. This is the cogravitational field of Oliver Heaviside which is an accurate model of
gravitation and
opposed to the incorrect model of gravitation as posited by the fool Einstein. All movement is a discharge, all relative
movement in
voidance is not movement at all but spatial (=movement, magnitude) voidance between two or more inertial charges or
masses.
A cogravitational field is any spherical domain, or region of space between two or more bodies where these masses
undergo the
cogravitational field by which space itself, **definitionally movement** , is either voided or increased (due to
divergent decelerating
movement). When Maxwell defined the electromagnetic field he utilized similar words, **[3, Vol. 1, paragraph 44, p. 47]:
** _“The
Electric Field is the portion of space in the neighborhood of electrified bodies, considered with reference to electric
phenomena.”_ All
phenomena are definitionally discharges and movement, the loss of inertia and the creation of space within which
phenomena must be
observed and noted. True Ether inertia is the antithesis of phenomena. It is incalculable.
At first one might ask: How can a region of space propagate in space? This makes no conventional sense. If the field is
not a region
of space, what definition should we utilize? Space itself is connected to one or more magnetic divergent fields. Space
has no existence
whatsoever of its own accord, and is only a posterior attribute of magnetic divergences; there are no “fields in space”,
only divergent
space in creation as posterior attributes of polarized and or transverse fields. This space, an attribute of divergent
fields, has itself an
attributional (but no attributes!) limit of induction or propagation as measured in C squared however this only applies
to transverse and
spatial phenomena, not longitudinal phenomena nor to dielectric inertial fields which exist underneath space as defined
by their
existence in counterspace.

**Below: The hyperboloid, proving that the dielectric inertial plane = 0, which is = 1, or infinite inertia. The
fundamental
comprehension of this principle is absolutely necessary to understand the conjugate nature of the magneto-dielectric
field
mechanics of both the universe and the operation of how a “magnet” works, both in whole and in part.**

Pathetically and altogether expected observational flaws conclude that, for instance, two “magnets” in increasing
movement
between each other in voidance (‘attraction’) are rationally ‘increasing movement’, but the case is that the spherical
magnetic
attributes of divergences (i.e. space itself) between them is being voided. What is being seen in this presumed
increasing movement is
in fact a reversal, an unwinding, an erasure of the spatial divergences between these two (or more) objects. Literally
the space, which
is definitionally movement, is being unwound in voidance. As such the observational movement(s) does not belong to
either object
rather the cogravitational (magnetic spatial divergence) field attribute being eliminated. Increasing movement over
time (co-attribute
of space) can only be the product of increasing inertia between two or more objects undergoing voidance. But however
this increasing
movement is not attributional to either object rather the reversal of the spatial divergence defined by and as movement
in decreasing
spherical volumes between the two objects in voidance (undergoing). Newton’s first law is utterly defunct and makes no
allowances
for fields as autonomous from forces nor does it take into account the fact that space itself is definitionally
movement, is divergence.
Potential cannot be measured, potential is the antithesis of phenomena, is inertia, is counterspace, is the Ether.
Humans cannot
measure or define anything devoid of volume or phenomenal characteristics. Potential in actualization is divergence, is
phenomena, is
governed by magnetism and therefore space in creation and therefore also movement and time. In positing the one, you get
the rest
necessarily so, that being space, movement, magnitude, phenomena and time.

**Below: The hyperbolic disk, as per the Poincare’ disk model. However the ancient Greeks knew of this long before
Poincare’
and expressed same by means of another analogy.**

Rest can only be said of the pure dielectric or Ether inertia, never of any mass or body, simplex or compounded. Space
is literally a
rubber band, a seemingly (only so) static pressure awaiting dielectric (gravitational, inertial dielectric in a
‘magnet’, or charge, as
crudely called attraction) voidance to loose its inflation and impel objects and fields in increasing movement in rapid
spatial deflation
of contracting spheres of movement being unwound (i.e. space) towards increasing potential inertia and decreasing
spatial discharges
towards higher states of inertia potential. The presumed “cogravitational field” of O. Heaviside is in fact the
deflation of space itself
between two or more bodies within which increasing movement is observed, but this movement is a property of space
itself (not the
objects) unwinding between objects or dielectric fields undergoing mutual counterspatial dielectric voidance (as meant
spatial
voidance, not literally the voidance of the dielectric, rather denoting voidance by means of dielectric acceleration, a
counterspatial
‘movement’). The reversal of movement (space) is yet another (so-called merely conventionally) movement (counterspatial
voidance),
increasing, but in voidance, in elimination, deflation, and erasure, not expansion; not unlike a rubber band, or any
polarized tension
which must be voided. Terminal speeds of voidance are dependent upon the intervening medium, friction, and limits of the
medium of
induction, in the case of space, this is C squared, however this is J.C. Maxwell’s discovery, not the idiot Einstein’s.
Counterspace is the opposite of any and all movement definitionally, only phenomena (as both meant and implicative of
space)
have movement, are divergent. A “movement towards counterspace” is not parcel to counterspatial inertia rather the
necessitated
unwinding of space, or as implied the inversion or erasure of the sphere or spheres of spatial divergence within which
movement must
and is re-expressed in reversal. The opposite of movement is not rest, as per Newton’s wrong premise, rather inertia.
Likewise it can
be stated the opposite of space is inertia, since movement and space are interchangeable qualities of divergent
byproducts of polarized
fields undergoing reciprocation.

**Below: The hyperbolic disk is and is necessitated to diverge and converge along the 137.5077 and 85 degrees (=1). This
is
proven, this is necessitated, and the model of how the ‘magnet’ and magnetism works has been fully established.

Counterintuitively to the pedestrian mind saying inertia is the opposite of movement seems alien, however this is a
mental defect
which must be overcome by comprehension. To say that inertia is both “it resists being stopped and it resists movement”
is likewise
an incorrect definition of field inertia and is a bastardized application attached to phenomenal objects, and cannot be
applied to fields
as pertains both motion and inertia which are wholly opposite each other. We have stuck in our brains the concept of a
moving object
“having inertia”. We may say this is correct in the framework of phenomenal contrivances in explanation but the exact
opposite is the
case as pertains fields. The two cannot, must not, shall not be confused if comprehension is to be grasped.
The four necessary principles of electrical engineering are 1. Time 2. Space 3. Dielectricity and 4. Magnetism. This can
be further
reduced into: 1. Movement of / between 2 and 3 (in which case time is a posterior attribute of measuring magnitudes in
movement) 3.
Dielectricity 3. Magnetism. Further still again it can be reduced into one principle. 1. Dielectric inertia torque
generated using a
magnetic field varied with respect to its pressure zones against the dielectric reflector. Space is merely a posterior
expression of
polarization, and time is a posterior expression of space in measurement. Space is definitionally movement and the
byproduct of
magnetic polarized field divergences. Space has no quantity, motion is a quality and stereographic unreal projection of
the loss of
inertia, space is only the attributional quality of movement which defines it. Rather than declare we or it is ‘moving
in space’, it is
correct to state that we or it is “in space which is movement”. The cogravitational field is the shrinking or increasing
sphere of
movement, i.e. space, between two or more (typically) bodies. Inertia must be given true definition as pertains to
fields. All decreasing
movement is the discharge of inertia, all increasing movement is the voidance of space and the increasing of inertia
which is
counterspatial. A moving body is a false representation of true inertia as found in a dielectric field, as expressed by
either gravity,
convergent centripetal voidance, or increasing charges.

**Below: The divergent hyperboloid drawing out the hypotrochoid divergence.**

Newton’s law was composed in ignorance of the nature of empirical bodies which are never at rest in nature. All space is
definitionally movement, relative movement between two bodies is pressure mediation and either the dissipation of
inertia or the
increasing of same. Likewise increasing movement between two or more bodies denotes the voidance of space and the
magnetic field
which created same in its divergent wake as necessitated attributional volume to the hyperbolic magnetic divergence.
When all motion
is eliminated, empirical bodies are likewise eliminated. Newton’s idiotic premise might as equally state that water is
at rest in a tub
when the drain is fully emptied of water. All motion is curvilinear pressure mediation and either decreasing in
movement, the
dissipation of inertia, or increasing in motion, the voidance of space between two or more objects. The dissipation of
chemical inertia
in gasoline has transference into motion, again all increasing motion over time (in the case of a tank of gas, it is
ultimately decreasing
motion potential as the tank is emptied of course) is the loss of inertia, is translational into radiation and or
motion.

**Below: Space is definitionally movement, relativity is a pure farce. The property of movement relational to space is
only
‘granted’ to same by way of divergent magnetism, and does not admit to space as an entity or principle in itself. This
premise
is the reason the idiot Einstein thought space can or could be ‘warped’, due to enormous dielectric voidance of motion,
or
space, however this premise is insane and flawed, only his brain and intellectual prowess was warped in making such a
pedestrian declaration. Inertia eliminates space, magnetism, divergence, and of course motion. From the ‘view’ of the
hyperbolic disk, magnetism returns as it leaves in a dimensionless line; from the ‘view’ or premise of the empirical
universe
(definitionally IN SPACE), magnetism reciprocates in hyperbolic divergences and convergences. Space is wholly an unreal
stereographic projection of inertia in discharge. Even the very term ‘discharge’ is not entirely correct (explained
elsewhere).**

The hyperboloid of magnetism and its necessitated motion is the loss of inertia definitionally. The “dielectric field in
discharge”
necessitates both motion and the creation of space. There is not one billionth of one microgram of matter in the
universe that has any
spatial volume save for magnetism. All space is supported by and created by the loss of dielectric inertia, as both
meant and implied
magnetism. Magnetism is a hyperbolic torque (tension) by which the Ether modality of inertia in discharge mediates its
own discharge
in creating the hyperboloid of magnetic centrifugal divergence against the inertial ‘line’ of the dielectric inertial
plane of the so-called
“magnet” (the coherent dielectric object) and mediates this pressure by polarized reciprocation and transverse
reintegration once
inertia has been regained. As has been said many times, no field can terminate in space since space is not a terminal
of, or for fields.
Inertia is dimensionless and stable however atomic inertia is constantly being ‘tapped’ and drained and necessitates
inter-atomic
magnetism; all movement is the breaking of inertia and necessitates magnetic divergence and polarized reciprocation.
There is no
prima causa, the highest movement inherent to Ether inertia is 1/Phi^-3, and likewise the sufficient co-principle (
aoristos dyad), or
attribute of The Principle, for all empirical manifestations.

**Below: Generation of the magnetic hyperboloid of infinite dielectric inertia in discharge as per the Poincare’ disk
using
AutoCAD. Notice the necessitated hypotrochoid on the far right. This is what is seen in the ferrocell, this is how
magnetism
necessarily reciprocates both divergently and convergently.**

The concept of “inertial mass” as posited by Einstein, Tolman and other mental midgets conflates the false premise that
inertia is or
is translational to mass, to magnitude; it is not. Mass is only as pertains to discharges, magnetism, phenomena and
movement / space,
not to inertia relevant to fields. The expressed energy of a system or mass is not translational or directly related to
inertia. Energy
relational to dimensional or three-dimensional coordinates are not directly applicable by any means with inertia which
is
counterspatial, and not in space, nor phenomenal. Einstein’s tensors, pseudo-tensors, and reification of space as
‘something’ that ‘does
things’ is a pure insanity and the child of a mental midget. The property of movement relational to space is only
‘granted’ to same by
way of divergent magnetism, and does not admit to space as an entity or principle in itself.

**Below: Human ignorance is literally in the ‘dark’. All the nonsense so-deemed by the cult of quantum as dark matter (
sic) and
‘dark energy’ is nothing more complex or convoluted than unmanifest dielectric inertia, the most fundamental, the most
rudimentary Ether modality in the universe. On the image at right, at top we have magnetism >1, in the middle we have
dielectric inertia < 1, and at bottom we have the Ether itself = 1 (/Phi^-3). This, my discovery of 13 year ago, is the
equation
behind all Ether modalities and the universe itself, simplex and divine, 1/Phi^-3.**

For example the Schwarzschild solution of the presumed inertia of a mass can assume any value depending upon the spatial
coordinates. Inertia is pre-extant to any and all phenomena and inertia likewise cannot be quantified based upon bodies
or masses.
That presumed fallacious 99.9999999999% of ‘nothing’ or ‘empty space’ at the inter-atomic of every atom accounts for
100% of the
energy released at the explosion of a nuclear device, NOT the conversion of any matter into energy. If this does not
define inertia for
you as being wholly separate from phenomena, then nothing will. As such, from the idiocy of Einstein and others 100% of
“nothing”
is in fact responsible for 100% of the power and energy released in a nuclear blast. As per wisdom, the world still
exists deep in the
dark. Here we can see that the general theory of insanity as posited by Einstein and parroted by others as per “inertial
mass” (a pure
contradiction) depends upon the spatial dimensional coordinates of that mass and therefore has no ultimate meaning
whatsoever.
Likewise therefore the assertion of the equivalency of mass and inertia is purely insane and wholly untrue. Inertia has
neither
magnitude, space, nor direction, only divergent magnetic fields do. This magnetism is movement, is phenomena, is
discharge. What is
potential, inertia, goes unseen and unknown and is without measure in the absolute sense and as the Absolute. The
‘unspooling’ of

counterspatial inertia in discharge as magnetism, just like a spring unwinding creates space, this space is movement, is
motion. All that
presumed ‘empty space’ is a motional after-shock of inertia in discharge, waiting to be voided. All motion, all space
must terminate
and end, even if it persists for an incalculable seeming eternity, it will terminate in reversal, the movement (spatial
reversal) into
counterspace. What is potential is not actual. What is actual or actualized is the unspooling of potential and the
‘winding’ up of
movement. Motion and space are both (one and the same) the mirage of inertia in phenomenal actualization.

**Below: Crude representation of the magneto-dielectric hyperboloid. Using the ferrocell and others methods, one can see
the
shrinking spatial sphere of dielectric voidance where inertia is assimilated between two “magnets” or by means of any
dielectric coherency. One cannot understand the field incommensurability of the “magnet” without grasping the inertia-
spatial magneto-dielectric hyperboloid at a fundamental level within your mind. Central inertia cannot be measured by
means
of mass calculations; this very premise is the basis for every flaw of relativity, quantum, and mathematical
non-Euclidean
pseudo-physics.**

_“For it must be confessed that the exhaustion of potential energy from a universal medium is a very unintelligible and
mysterious
matter. When matter is infinitely widely separated, and the forces are least, the potential energy is at its greatest,
and when the
potential energy is most exhausted, the forces are most energetic!”_ *
*_– Oliver Heaviside [Part I, The Electrician, 31, 281-282 (1893)]_**

By “widely separated” Heaviside is referring to space, by which we can state that the greater the divergence between
matter the
greater the movement (=space) that exists and must voided to terminate the (multiple) objects of matter (dielectric
condensates in
motion which likewise produce, obviously, magnetism). This so-called ‘potential energy” is not energy at all but the
motion that is
space which is voided in increasing motion towards increasing inertia and dielectric convergence (‘voidance’). When
speaking about
the “potential energy most exhausted” Heaviside is referring to a singular mass which has the highest collective
gravitational “force”.
But this is field inertia, not force. Accelerating or moving bodies in voidance are voiding space and increasing
collective inertia.
Heaviside is incorrectly using the term ‘energy’ to refer to movement, i.e. space, and likewise wrongly using the term
‘force’ as
applied to dielectric inertia as found in the condensate of matter/mass.

**Below: The forming hyperboloid of the magneto-dielectric system of the magnet as governed by the hyperbolic disk, the
loss of
inertia and necessitated spatial vectorization as the Ether modality called magnetism. Polarization is the creation of
space, not
“into space”; rather the creation of space as resultant byproduct of the divergence of magnetism and its reciprocation.
**

In short, Heaviside is speaking about, analogously, a 1 kilogram mass spread across the cosmos having a high “energy” (
space,
motion) potential towards mutual convergent movement (voiding space) and the same 1 kilogram mass together having voided
space
(the lowest spatial situation or “energy” in his incorrect wording), but the highest collective counterspatial
gravitational inertia which,
of course, voids space. This premise is the reason the idiot Einstein thought space can or could be ‘warped’, due to
enormous
dielectric voidance of motion, or space, however this premise is insane and flawed, only his brain and intellectual
prowess was warped
in making such a pedestrian declaration. Inertia eliminates space, magnetism, divergence, and of course motion.
Space is not warped or otherwise, rather is the aftershock of divergence as measured in motion and likewise by time
which is
voided in counterspatial fields, centripetal convergences, gravity, dielectric convergences. Nature does not abhor a
vacuum, she abhors
the motion that is relational and attributable to space itself. However, of course, this motion, this space, this
divergence, this
magnetism is as necessitated as illumination is to light itself. Absolute inertia or inertia before discharge cannot be
measured, and
likewise the energy of a mass cannot be made an equivalency with inertia in quantity.

**Below: The Poincare’ disk in stereographic projection is literally the vectorization, the polarization, the divergence
and the
‘emergence’ of the Ether modality of magnetism. This is the nature of magnetic divergence, what it is, why it is, how it
is, and
is absolutely without reproach, and irrefutable. It cannot exist any other way or by any other means. You are witness to
the
first complete and total (and unfolding in this work in whole) explanation of what magnetism is and how the magnet
works,
and its field mechanics.**

**Below: The Poincaré Disk model of hyperbolic geometry is obtained from the hyperboloid by stereographic projection.
Stereographic projection of an ordinary sphere maps the sphere to the XY-plane by projecting from the South Pole; points
in
the Northern Hemisphere (z > 0) map to the interior of a disk, points in the Southern Hemisphere (z < 0) map to its
exterior,
and the Equator (z = 0) maps to the circle bounding the disk. The idea of stereographic projection is the same for the
Minkowskian hyperboloid. But what are the Poles? They are dielectricity in discharge, i.e. magnetism. They are the two
points
where the t-axis intersects the hyperboloid, but now we need both branches. So the South Pole is the point. P=(0,0,−ρ)**

All discharges are definitionally spatial. Magnetism’s divergence into the creation of space, inversely and incorrectly
deemed by
many as ‘into space’ rather than, accurately, creating space; the natural counterspatial and radial nature of
dielectricity is
necessitatively divergent in discharge in an expanding circulatory fashion. But this is still lacking in an explanation
and is merely an
elaborate description, which is insufficient.
Spatial vectorization of loss of inertia in discharge (as per the Poincare' disk model which dielectricity MUST follow
necessitatively) is not a termination, only a (posterior creation of space as both meant, implied, and connotated by the
term
polarization) vector of reintegration to 're-initialize' the loss of inertia to maintain a stasis of the Ether-modality
of dielectricity
denotated as magnetism in its polarized state of 'resetting' its own pressure mediating inertia by spatial vectorization
and radial
assimilation to its original radial inertia.

**Below: Various visual models of hyperboloid expression demonstrating divergent torque in loss of inertia necessitates
both
gyromagnetic precession and inverse vortex spin magnetic divergence.**

The loss of dielectric inertia in discharge necessitates the spatial vectorization into magnetic polarization, this of
course is the Ether
modality of magnetism.

The Poincaré disk model, also called the conformal disk model, is a model of n-dimensional hyperbolic geometry in which
the points
of the geometry are in an n-dimensional disk, or unit ball, and the straight lines of the hyperbolic geometry are
segments of circles
contained in the disk orthogonal to the boundary of the disk, or else diameters of the disk. What this means however is
that you can
‘fit’ infinite dielectric inertial into a super-point of counterspace on a non-dimensional inertial plane, or ‘disk’.
The Poincaré
hyperbolic disk is a two-dimensional space having hyperbolic geometry defined as the disk with hyperbolic metric

The hyperboloid model can be seen as the equation of t^2 =x^2 +y^2 +1. It can be used to construct a Poincaré disk model
as a perspective
projection viewed from (t=-1,x=0,y=0), projecting the upper half hyperboloid onto an (x,y) unit disk at t=0.

We must address the great question as to WHY magnetism must reciprocate centrifugally from one side to the centripetal
point on the
other pole. Firstly no field can terminate in space, because space is not a terminal for any field. Secondly Ether
radiation, i.e.
magnetism, unlike particle and dielectro-electromagnetism, cannot exist independent of its discharging source. Even
‘electromagnetism’ in the case of light cannot leave its dielectric Z-axis radial component.

**Below: The convergent “pseudo-sphere”. To give an accurate visual model of how the (both convergent and divergent)
convergent centripetal magnetism re-assimilates is drawn out by a hypotrochoid. As most have dropped a coin into a coin
funnel, if you were to notice closely, it does not draw out a decreasing circle in radius but a hypotrochoid pattern,
this is
dielectric voidance, the erasure of space and increasing inertia. One the center is cross, there is infinite inertia and
magnetism
then ‘becomes’ dielectricity once again. Charge-discharge is all a null-fulcrum transference in simple, it cannot exist
any other
way. The term ‘pseudo-sphere’ of course is complete nonsense, literally all that is genuinely meant is the erasure of
movement
towards counterspace, the erasure of the sphere, or space, by means of a counterspatial movement, which is the voidance
of
movement, the assimilation of infinite inertia in counterspace. The notion that these geometries are “Pseudo-Euclidean”
is
pure absolute trash and nonsense, the full and ripe definition of counterspace found its seat and pinnacle with the
ancient
Greeks.**

**Below: The genuine magneto-dielectric “pseudo-sphere’ is not a spatial formation (humans can only see spatial
phenomena!)
as ‘seen’ below on the right, but inertial. The decreasing ‘points’ are increasing discharge and increasing movement,
increasing creation of space, likewise of course necessitatively decreasing inertia. Moving towards the center is a
movement to
infinite inertia; by which, while it cannot be illustrated, the center section has no radius, rather is infinite.**

Magnetism is the necessitated spatial expression of inertial loss of dielectricity, which causes spatial reciprocation
as the Ether
modality of magnetism after which time it must terminate where dielectric voidance is lowest, centripetally on the other
pole.

Even magnetic divergence must discharge its own divergence after passing the dielectric boundary of the physical magnet.
The Ether
fulcrum of divergence must polarize and definitionally reciprocate back to the point of divergence as re-initialized
convergence.

**Below: The many forms of hyperbolic stereographic projections of dielectricity in discharge which vary based upon
gauss,
power, and ultimately dielectric condensate zones of immense power where matter itself is created. The hyperboloid of
‘two
sheets’ closes off divergence and creates a condensate of near-infinite inertia, the mass particle, when then
necessarily creates
its own space, the inter-atomic of the hydrogen atom.**

**The Euclidean Ether expressed in four modalities and one principle of inertia**

There is no such entity as warped space, only fields that are mediating pressures centripetally, centrifugally,
transversely
(dielectromagnetism), or radially as found in longitudinal dielectrics which are radial and without a transverse
electrical constituent.
As we already know full well, magnetism forms the complete hyperboloid of vortex reciprocation of dielectricity in
discharging
pressure mediation in the loss of its inertia in discharge. The Ether fulcrum of pressure mediation between
dielectricity in its
counterspatial inertia and magnetism in its polarized (=creates space, motion) centrifugal divergence are merely
complimentary and
necessitated expressions of one radial inertia principle and divergence attribute both as a consubstantial whole.
As you can see below, even the magnetic hyperboloid is comprised of curvilinear radial lines that are vectorized as
necessitated by
discharged or transferred inertia. All energy archetypes are Ether modalities with attributional necessitated modalities
of
differentiation which distinguish them as unique but absolutely not separate in any way.

**Below: All four ether modalities can be expressed simply and with clarity to the point that even a 10 year old might
grasp it.
The universe is not complex, it is simplex, however its compounded formations and Ether modalities are rapidly complex,
never the less, the principles themselves are not.**

**Below: As is seen, all Ether modalities can be expressed by radial lines of divergence, convergence, transverse,
circulatory and
otherwise attributional phenomena. The motional discharge and spatial vectorization govern the attributional qualities
of this
radial inertia as expressed in four different modalities.**

**Below: Magneto-dielectric conjugate pressure formation analogous to the Ether pressure mediations as found within the
“magnet” on left. On right, self-explanatory simplicity that must be grasped to have any fundamental comprehension of
field
modalities.**

**Below: New discoveries in vortex light and D.E.M. transmissions are unfolding rapid. Compounded data volume transfers
are
being realized at an exponential rate and are at the cusp of changing the world and communications.**

**Below: Dielectricity, Ether inertia, is literally the line by which an extremely wide array of vortex and twisted
hyperboloids
can be created, both in magnetism, dielectric magnetism with its radial dielectric component, either visible, radio or
otherwise.
The future is only beginning in creating phased and unphased EM spectrum phenomena to change the future.**

**Below: All radial inertia Ether modalities find their pressure mediations, either as radial or longitudinal modalities
or as
hyperbolic dielectricity in discharge centrifugal magnetic hyperboloids or otherwise. If it cannot be illustrated or
described by
Euclidean geometry and math, it does not exist in nature. Quantum is a convoluted fairy tale.**

**The RGB LED discovery of the dielectric voidance of light at the dielectric inertial plane of the ‘magnet’**

**Discovery copyright June 18, 2014 Ken L. Wheeler**. RGB magneto-dielectric dispersion using the T. Vanderelli
ferrocell invention.

As was predicted, tested and first discovered by myself, magnetism disperses the light with its Z-axis radial dielectric
component
just as the Faraday effect would predict it would, however even Faraday had no idea as to the reasoning behind this
phenomena. The
inventor of the ferrocell, T. Vanderelli, has been contacted and he has confirmed this phenomenon has never been seen
before.
The blue light has higher dielectric pulses and capacitance as per (see later part of this book) the missing component
of light, that
being the Z-axis radial dielectric constituent of light. As for the blue light, there is much less of same is seen along
either divergent
poles of the “magnet”, which is why the blue light is almost not present along either pole. Second and third party
testing has
confirmed my discovery as was predicted to occur by myself. While the divergent blue light can be seen along the pole,
the
convergent magnetism has completely displaced the high dielectric capacitance of the blue wavelength light.

**Below: On left, RGB LED cell, middle 3.1mm RGB element. Far right, greatly filtered light showing the RGB elements
illuminated. Under normal viewing, the light is intensely white and there are no red green or blue elements visible.**

**Below: Blue light and green light have much higher dielectric radial capacitance in light from a great many more
dielectric
pulses than does red spectrum light. As such, as seen below, red light is very present around the “magnet” (divergent
magnetism) whereas green far less, and blue further still much less to the point of barely being there requiring longer
exposure times to be visible by the camera.**

**Below: As predicted and discovered by myself there is white light along the dielectric inertial plane of a N50 1” cube
neodymium (any magnet as a matter of fact) and red and green light along the poles due their lower dielectric
capacitance.
Literally the three magneto-dielectric (convergent, divergent, and dielectric) pressure field-zones of the “magnet”, the
divergent centrifugal, the convergent centripetal, and the dielectric inertial plane have dissected the light into its
relevant
constituents based upon the magnitude of their dielectric pulse compositions proportional to wavelength. The invention
potentials for this discovery have yet to be fully realized but are to be sure, enormous.**

**Below: On left very low light levels showing all light being brought along the dielectric inertial plane; both poles
are left and
right in the image. On right is blue light concentrated along the dielectric inertial plane and some visible along the
centrifugal
convergent point. All predicted by myself before testing, and perfectly logical once comprehension of the so-called
“magnet” is
fully realized.**

**Below: Left, green illumination, roughly a midpoint dielectric exposure between red and blue, and resultantly about a
mid-
point exposure of light between red and blue in what is absorbed along the dielectric inertial plane and centripetally
as
contrasted with the red on right with maximum exposure and low levels of dielectric pulses resultant to the red
wavelength
light directed upon the pressure zones of centrifugal, centripetal and dielectric inertial. Exposure times of the camera
must
also be considered in that the green and blue are both substantially more absorbed along the dielectric entry points of
the 1”
cube.**

**Magnetism vs. Dielectricity, redefining the long-held nonsense of “magnetic attraction & magnetic**

**repulsion”, or ‘the middle’**

What have I illustrated below further than scientific ‘art’? The premise of comprehension that must be understood is
that
magnetism is not ‘driving’ any and all ‘magnets’; this ancient belief is pure uninformed insanity and illogical
nonsense. Magnetism is
the radiation, the hyperboloid spatial vectorization and polarization of dielectricity in discharge. Likewise further
pressure mediation
between objects that are merely under magnetic induction and dielectric coherency, which are therefore magnetically
dominant while
under induction mediate their pressures at full counter-voidance (repulsion) to the high dielectric capacitance as
against the “magnet”
against which they rest.
Inversely so to these objects, likewise “magnetic” objects with high dielectric inertia/ capacitance mediate their
pressures along the
dielectric inertial plane of the “magnet” against which they rest. This dielectric inertial plane is illustrated with a
green line below in
the images. In simplex, objects are either dielectrically dominant or under magnetic induction and have no increase in
dielectric
capacitance, only coherency, likewise further still have a forced decreased dielectric ‘presence’ while under magnetic
induction, as
such they are magnetically dominant in more ways than one, therefore only resting in pressure mediation perpendicular to
the
dielectric inertia plane where inertial resistance is absolutely minimal.

**Below: 2x2x1” block neodymium, sitting on top is a disk magnet, on the side is a steel disk, sitting perpendicular to
the
dielectric inertial plane, bottom is a steel ring with a knife-thin edge also sitting perpendicular to the dielectric
inertial plane.
Middle picture is same but with the ring on the side. On the far right, a different angle of the middle picture. The
dielectric
inertial plane is marked with a green line.**

**Below: Left is a 5/8” neodymium with a disk magnet in parallel to the 5/8” dielectric inertial plane, also a steel
ring sitting
perpendicular to the dielectric inertial plane. Middle picture, steel disk perpendicular to the inertial plane. Pictured
on right is
a large ring neodymium magnet with a 5mm ball neodymium on the I.D. with its inertial planes lined up with the ring
magnets. Sitting on top is the steel ring sitting perpendicular to the dielectric inertial plane, and on the bottom
right is the disk
magnet sitting parallel to the inertial plane of dielectricity. The dielectric inertial plane is marked with a green
line.**

**Below: 3/4” sphere magnet with its dielectric inertial plane marked, sitting at the angle of gyromagnetic precession.
It is sitting
on top of a large ring neodymium magnet. Atop the sphere is a copper coated steel ball to further show the gyromagnetic
precession angle. Pictured on the right, are both the sphere magnet and ring magnet resting along each others dielectric
inertial planes. So-called “magnetic attraction” is a complete lie and an age old perpetrated premise based upon the
perceptual
ignorance of magnets “attracting” steel and other ferrous bits. What is driving dielectric voidance (‘attraction’) is
dielectricity.
Magnetism does not attract, as a force, anything whatsoever, it only displaces and diverges, as is its nature of the
Ether
modality of divergent discharge, or radiation. The dielectric inertial plane is marked with a green line.**

**Below: 3/4” sphere neodymium and disk magnet sitting in perfect pressure mediation along their mutual dielectric
inertial
planes. Likewise on right, showing phi^-2 contact as necessitated by gyromagnetic precession.**

**Below: Left, ¾ sphere neodymium sitting at the angle of gyromagnetic precession as it naturally rests with two steel
balls on
top to further delineate this angle. The entire neodymium sphere acts like one giant atom within any “magnet” except for
the
rotational precession that occurs as the hyperboloid does in magnetic divergence. On the right showing that gravity is
irrelevant of any position of steel or neodymium regarding pressure mediation between what is merely under magnetic
induction and therefore dielectric coherency and the disk neodymium which has both dielectric coherency and increased
dielectric capacitance. Iron is literally, in analogy, a ‘rubber band atom’ which can store both higher dielectric
capacitance,
especially in a neo-iron-boron lattice, or iron can undergo simplex dielectric coherence while under magnetic induction
which
causes resultant dielectric capacitance.**

**Below: Both artistic and interesting, the key point is the illuminate the nature of and differentiate the magnetic
induction of
steel with increased dielectric capacitance of a neodymium (or any “magnet”) wherein which field pressure mediation is
90
degrees opposite for both the steel and the neodymium along its adjacent ‘resting’ position. It cannot be stressed too
much or
often enough that the binding magneto-dielectric fields within the inter-atomic of all and every atom is expressed by
and thru
inertial planes of dielectric inertia and polarized pairs of magnetic hyperboloid forming hyperbolas.**

**Below: Further examples of where magnetic induction finds its pressure mediation vs. high dielectric capacitance finds
its
pressure mediation along and or against the 1” cube magnet. The steel can only rest perpendicular to the dielectric
inertial
plane whereas the “magnets” can only rest in parallel to the dielectric inertial plane.**

**Below: When you understand how magnetism and dielectricity mediate out each others pressures the images below become
lucid and clear child’s play intellectually. On the right we have pyrolytic graphite resting on its thin edge against
the divergent
centrifugal “flow” of hyperbolic magnetism just like a stick in a stream will run end to end along the flow of the
stream and
not crosswise, or against the pressure flow.**

**Below: Pyrolytic graphite easily balanced along its edge in line with the divergent centrifugal magnetism to which the
diamagnetic pyrolytic graphite is repulsed due to high order dielectric inertia within the carbon crystalline lattice of
the
graphite.**

**Below: Bismuth disk’s final resting place, perpetually ending at the same spread leaving the same golden ratio
attraction
(voidance) and countervoidance (repulsion) position along the 2”x1” cylinder neodymium. This harmonic precession always
finalizes in the same location due to mutual pressure mediation between the diamagnetic bismuth and the centripetal
convergent point of the cylinder neodymium. Contrary to popular conception, bismuth, the universes most diagmagnetic
element, is as ‘attracted’ the so-called magnet as is steel, however the expression of same must take into account its
very low
magnetic permeability.**

**Below: Valid perpetually repeatable results of spinning a bismuth disk on top of any magnet that its circumference
will not
stray from the centripetal convergent point of any “magnet”, and will likewise rest on this edge, in perfect pressure
mediation
of the bismuth’s diamagnetic counter-voidance of its extremely high magnetic reluctivity and likewise its dielectric
permittivity as expressed by its voidance at the centripetal convergent point of the “magnet”. This is always a mutual
golden
ratio expression; in this case Phi (1.618033) and 1/Phi (.618033).**

**An analogy, both of the “magnet” and human ignorance**

In the "magic faucet" amusement, there is a meaningless faucet seemingly hanging in the air with no source for its water
nor its
support; it constantly pours out water, contrary to conventional visual views and logic, it is amusing to watch. Of
course, what is
holding up this faucet is a clear plastic tube within which water is being pumped up thru the tube to just inside the
faucet, and then
over the edge it flows via gravity outside the clear tube, both occluding the clear tube from view and making it seem
that water is only
pouring out, rather than up and into the faucet. All of this is driven by an electrical water pump hidden in the pool,
which is not
visible.
In a “magnet”, the "pump" driving the magnetism (water), which flows, is the dielectric inertial plane concentrated and
focused at
the center (actually its everywhere, but forced to the midpoint by incommensurate magneto-dielectric geometry of
opposite fields in a
binding system, the "magnet". As such dielectricity is NOT ‘located’ at the center.). While in the case of the “magic
faucet”
amusement, gravity is causing the resultant convergence back to the pool from which it was pumped, in the case of the
“magnet”,
convergent return of the ‘dielectric field’ (i.e. magnetism) is driven by simplex pressure mediation of the
reciprocating and “flowing”
divergent radiation that is magnetism resultant from the point non-specific dielectricity either coherent or increased
dielectric
coherence, as present all throughout the physical “magnet”.

**Below: The “magic faucet amusement”. Water is being pumped from an unseen pump in the pool up through a clear tube to
just inside the faucet and allowed to pour out around the tube via gravity. What is driving magnetism is not magnetism,
rather
dielectricity, and this is the “charging pump” within each and every magnet. Whether the “magnet” was created via mere
induction from a powerful magnet or created by increased dielectric capacitance makes no difference; the resultant in
the
same.**

Simplex human stupidity only “sees the waters” (magnetism)’ even a more intelligent person who knows how this trick
works,
only “sees” the water, and while knowing how it works, is amused at and by the spatially flowing (in our case, magnetic
fields)
demonstration. All flow, all radiation, all discharge, is driven by a **charge, a prima causa** ; in the case of the
magnet, dielectricity, and
in the case of the amusement, an electrical water pump which is hidden. Therefore, as is the case, dielectricity is
radial, centripetal,
counterspatial, inertial, and its very nature is “hidden” as well. Dielectricity and magnetism are the two co-principle
conjugate Ether
modalities in the universe, one is charging, the other discharging, one is counterspatial, the other spatial. One is
inertial, the other is
circulatory. Contrary to conventional logic, as per fields, increased movement is decreasing inertia and implied of
magnetism in
discharge. Likewise decreasing movement is increasing inertia and implied of dielectricity in charge or centripetal
convergence. The
stasis of inertia requires discharging magnetic polarization and resultant vectorization as space (not into space) to
maintain the
conservation of Ether inertia in the dielectric.
Dielectric coherency (in a soft magnet) or dielectric capacitance increase from discharging coils results in the unique
magneto-
dielectric coherent pattern as seen in so-called “magnets”. In both cases, the resultant radiation (magnetism) has been
either made
apparently polarized (magnetism is always polarized definitionally so, but is in disorder and incoherent between normal
atomic matter
inside the interatomic) or both coherently polarized and increased; **likewise any coherency of one necessitates the
coherency of the
other**. Amusingly, in the creation of a powerful magnet from discharging coils in which capacitance is increased, we
are “feeding our
horse” (dielectricity) with more food/charge, we likewise expect resultantly a ‘much larger discharge’ from the ‘other
end(s)’, in this
case radiative high gauss ratings of divergent discharging Ether fields, as meant our magnetism.
Contrary to popular conventional thinking, a higher gauss magnet does not have a “longer reach” in magnetic effects,
rather in fact
a SHORTER ONE SPATIALLY as is both logical and necessitated. A higher dielectric inertia necessitates a more and more,
or
increasingly spatially shallow magnetic vectorization to maintain this dielectric inertia. Likewise a LOW VACUUM
pressure has a
greater spatial effect than does an extremely HIGH VACUUM pressure. This is high counterspatial dielectric inertia
expressing its
fundamental discharging magnetic polarization with a more shallow spatial gauss flux phenomena. The higher the
counterspatial
‘vacuum’ the smaller the spatial aperture. The lower the counterspatial ‘vacuum’ the larger the resulting spatial
aperture.

**Below: Prima Causa is the last and ultimate allegory. It derives from the ancient Platonic idea of the 'Unmoved Mover'
a. First
Cause is no cause, only attribute. This discovery from ten years ago is 1/Phi^-3. There can be no first cause
definitionally.**

No fields can, have ever, will never terminate “in space”. This is the cornerstone of J.C. Maxwell, C.P. Steinmetz,
Tesla and others,
and is accurate. Space is a terminal for nothing, and of nothing. Space has never “done anything”, nor caused anything.
Space is the
posterior attribute of fields. As such, no field can "terminate into space", they can into themselves and other fields,
but space itself has
no capacitance other than the inductive ability granted it by the field(s) to which it is a byproduct thereof.

**Divergence and Convergence as a model of dielectric discharge, magnetism, and centripetal convergence**

**One of the best analogies to understand magnetic divergence and convergence is its counterpart in nature, pressure
flow
mediation in the atmosphere. Additionally it helps (or should) you understand that the four counterparts of mutual
pressure
flow (dual inverse spin convergence and dual inverse spin divergence) typify one system of magnetic pressure mediation,
centrifugal divergent, centripetal convergence, reciprocation, and inverse spin/flow. Just like the air in divergent and
convergent weather, we have one Ether, with four modalities, however expressed dually in the so-called “magnet”; that
being
dielectricity, and dielectricity in discharge, i.e. magnetism. As has been said many times, nature gives you the answers
to all its
system in other systems; you only have to have open eyes and clear minds to see the obvious.**

**Below: One can just as easily rationalize the trough axis in a weather system of air pressure with the dielectric
inertial plane
where mutually divergent and convergent systems both move from and towards each other in mediating field pressures, or
in
this case air pressure. Below is merely a different modality of natural expression of what occurs, but not comprehended
until
now, in and of the permanent magnet. Obviously so the earth cannot have simultaneous high pressure everywhere or
inversely
low pressure everywhere, nor can a magnet be a ‘one way fire hose’ of magnetic centrifugal divergence. Magnetism, or
dielectricity in discharge cannot exist independent of its source and is necessitatively reciprocating upon itself.**

Whereas in the case of the sun warming various parts of the earth unevenly due to reflectance, day and night heating and
cooling, we
have a perpetual quadrapolar divergent-convergent system of pressure mediations wherein which the earth’s atmosphere is
perpetually
self-adjusting its own pressures resultant to expansive hot and contractive (centripetal convergent) air movements, the
suns heat, and
many other factors. As any gauss meter will register to you, the highest pressure points on a magnet are its divergent
centrifugal edge,
and secondly its convergent centripetal point at the center of every polarized side.

**Below: Global daily cooling and heating drives, like a ‘magnets’ dielectric inertia does, a system of perpetual
pressure
mediation.**

Magnetism is the necessitated spatial expression of inertia loss of dielectricity which causes spatial reciprocation as
the Ether
modality of magnetism after which time it must terminate where dielectric voidance is lowest, centripetally on the other
pole. Even
divergence must discharge its own spatial divergence since it has no energy of its own, only as impelled to divergence
by the dielectric
in discharge which initiated the centrifugal discharge.

**Below: Likewise as a magnet, we have high-pressure atmospheric divergence and low-pressure convergence both
necessitatively due to pressure, and likewise is the case, that no line of field flux can or may terminate in space, it
is impossible.**

**Below: While spatially separated in location, you can imagine both surface convergence and surface divergence existing
mutually as a necessitated pair on both poles of every ‘magnet’ that exists. Every ‘dipolar’ magnet is in reality a
quadrapole
with each pole having both necessitated divergence at the edge of centrifugal magnetism and necessitated convergence at
the
center of centripetal dielectric voidance and inertial reintegration. Superluminal spinning trillions of coherent atomic
‘magnet’ nuclei are the impetus for the inter-atomic magneto dielectric principle of atoms which, in the case of the
‘magnet’ is
coherent and has enormous macro-atomic phenomenal effects.**

**Below: While mutual quadrapolar divergence-convergence is necessitated in total, with both existent on either pole, it
is
necessary to understand that magnetism is not driving magnetism, or are divergent and convergent weather patterns of air
movement driven by air movement. In the case of the earth, it is perpetual heating and cooling from daily day and night
heating and cooling cycles, likewise the case with the presumed ‘magnet’, which is driven by coherent dielectric
inertia, which
in discharge necessitates divergent magnetism and convergent re-integration, or dielectric voidance.**

**Below: Every pole of every magnet has a centrifugal divergent anti-cyclonic pressure zone and a centripetal voidance
zone of
cyclonic pressure. Field pressure self-regulation is the Ether fulcrum of inertia within which discharge causes the
creation of
space resultant to magnetic fields, and this causes additionally, a loss of inertia and cyclic discharge.**

**Below: On the left we can imagine the dielectric inertial plane of every ‘magnet’ within which the magnetic breaking
induces
the perpetual circuit of magnetic divergence, upon which discharge feeds same and the cycle repeats endlessly. The
‘magnet’ is
a literal perpetual feedback look of magneto-dielectric self-mediating harmony and field pressure reciprocative
perfection.**

**Below: If you can understand how pressure mediation works in empirical models, you can understand same in Ether
modalities. Divergence necessitates convergence, and unlike other natural phenomena, fields cannot terminate in space,
rather
only upon themselves or affectively upon another field. Likewise all polarity is radiation, and in a single binding
system,
inverse relative polarity spin is not only always observed, but absolutely necessary without exception.**

**Proof that magnetic centrifugal and centripetal reciprocations follow the golden ratio and are a system**

**hyperboloid of Phi cubed**

The math of the magnetic vortex is just expanding and contracting interlacing singular system of a dielectric
hyperboloid,
composed up of divergent polarized (definitionally obviously so and necessitated) radiation and convergent dielectric
voidances at the
centripetal point of both polarized spatial divergences (‘poles’). The lowest possible pressure mediations necessitated
by and thru
opposite field modalities, divergent and convergent, and gyromagnetic pressure precessions, can only be expressed by phi
and a
dielectric hyperboloid.

**Below: My formula and discovery for calculating the MEAN FIELD divergences, and convergence of the idealized magnet.
Copyright discovery 7-28-2014 Ken L. Wheeler**

**Below: Mathematical proof that centripetal contracting fields “draw out” convergent spheres of a vortex-toroid, and
centrifugal fields “draw out” expanding divergent vortex-toroid hyperboloid spheres. This golden section ratio of
divergence
and convergence is convergent centripetal fields = centripetal radius of 1; and centrifugal divergent fields are a

after four
years of looking. Needless to say, it is the golden section mediation of divergence, convergence, and incommensurability
which
explains the Pythagorean discovery of the importance of incommensurability between the 137.5 golden angle, and the

using the
ferrocell and many others methods.** *
*_All movement is as against (discharge) and around a null fulcrum of dielectric inertia, the
fundamental Ether and field modality in the universe._**

**CRT Tube dynamics of dielectric influence from magnetic deflection and dielectric voidance**

Since the CRT tube is a cathode ray dielectric projector, and knowing that magnetism deflects dielectric inertia, using
a large CRT
tube as an empirical model to show the field mechanics of the magnet is an obvious decision. Light cannot be directly
bent or directed
with electricity, only with magnetism. Electricity is Phi x Psi (dielectric and magnetic). Dielectricity in the Z-axis
radial dielectric
component of light responds to deflection only from magnetism, or the magnetic component of electricity; the magnetic
constituent of
electricity can direct it to a degree. *

in which the CW projected spiral maintains its directionality, proving that this inverse pole of the magnet is moving in
the
same direction as the projected vortex, which is clockwise.**

**Below: A pair of perfect examples of both inverse pole CW and CCW spin, inverse at both centripetal and centrifugal as
must
be necessitated! On the left you can see the spiral projected ring has been made to form a torus meaning the centrifugal
magnetism is inverse to the projected clockwise spiral, making the centrifugal magnetism CCW, in which case, as is
demonstrated you can see at the center a CW centripetal formation. Exactly the opposite on the right, the centrifugal
magnetism is going in the SAME direction as the CW projected vortex on the CRT, and as must be the case at the center,
the
centripetal magnetic convergence is going CCW.**

**Below: On the left you can see the pair of hyperbolas as being pushed out by the centrifugal magnetism and likewise

very close
to the CRT tube at which there is an egg shaped formation. Along the dielectric inertial plane the perfect pressure
mediation is
a dielectric voidance and a centrifugal magnetic displacement. Likewise you can see along the centripetal point a higher
concentration of light. This type of conjugate field pressure mediation is no different than squeezing a circular
balloon on one
end at which the point of counterspatial constriction is small and the spatial divergence is expanded.**

likewise CW

point of
centripetal voidance between both the magnets dielectric inertial plane and the projected dielectric from the CRT.

**Inventor Timm A. Vanderelli ferrocell:** The magnetic flux viewer utilizes the combined properties of a ferromagnetic
colloidal
mixture, magnetism and the transmission of light to view a presentation of magnetic flux. The magnetic flux viewer
comprises a
ferromagnetic colloidal mixture positioned between two optically transmissive lenses, the lenses including a means for
containing the
mixture there between. Mixture is comprised of a plurality of magnetically reactive particles. There is at least one
magnetic source
juxtaposed about the mixture and a visible light source that is positioned to project through the mixture. The
interaction of light waves
and the mixture creates a visual presentation of magnetic flux.
The ferromagnetic colloidal mixture comprises nano-sized magnetite particles coated with a surfactant and suspended in a
colloidal
mixture that respond to the application of a localized magnetic field thereby aligning themselves in the direction of
the magnetic field
and forming nano-particle chains. Preferably, the ferromagnetic colloidal mixture is a translucent fluid. When this
translucent mixture
is contained and placed into a magnetic field, light waves scatter and rotate as they pass through the mixture
positioned between the
two lenses in regions where the magnetic field has reached its lowest potential. In examples, the viewer also creates a
visual
presentation of the interaction between magnetic flux and other elements of matter. The claimed magnetic flux viewer
makes this
Super-paramagnetic event visible. _-_ **_Timm A. Vanderelli (www.ferrocell.us)_**

The Ferrocell is a simple, low-cost device that will scatter light in a direction determined by the application of a
magnetic field
(magnetic anisotropy). Polarized _or_ un-polarized light will reveal a representation of the applied field with a 3-D
spatial geometry in
agreement with Maxwell’s Equations. Utilizing quantum effects made possible by nanotechnology, this Ferrohydrodynamic
Lens has
the potential to enhance the performance of many existing Photonic applications.

Apply light and magnetism to either surface. The strength and orientation of the applied field will determine the
plane (angle) of
light coming out of the cell. Using a permanent magnet is the simplest way to apply a field and see how a Ferrocell will
change the
path of light. To make this event visible to the naked eye, a large surface area and strong magnetic fields are
required. Currently, there
are no demonstration units available for smaller scales. Although similar to the Faraday Effect, a Ferrocell affects
light up to 90
degrees in a single stage, whereas a Faraday rotator would require two stages to accomplish the same task.. And a
Ferrocell will
exhibit the same results with polarized or non-polarized light. Using four stages of deflection with a Ferrocell will
allow 360 degrees
of rotation. _-_ **_Timm A. Vanderelli (www.ferrocell.us)_**

My deepest and warm thanks go out to Timm Vanderelli of Ferrocell U.S.A. in material support & providing more empirical
proof
for the worlds first accurate explanation of how a magnet works, as illuminated in this work. Magneto-dielectric field
incommensurability (F.I.) can now not only be defined in full but also illustrated in depth by use of the T. Vanderelli
Ferrocell
invention (US8246356, US20070241745). All my accurate conclusions of magneto-dielectric conjugate field
incommensurability now
have further empirical validity thanks to the ferrocell; after the fact of my discovery, and my disclosure of the
magneto-dielectric field
mechanics as to how a ‘magnet’ operates, its field inertia and discharge hyperboloid formation, I learned of the
ferrocell invention.
After the 2nd edition, I came across the ferrocell, one of the key empirical validities I needed to prove my theory
accurate.
Every institute of learning, even down to high school and lower, should own a ferrocell to educate, inspire, and
enlighten future
minds as to the fundamental forces of nature hidden within light and especially magnetism; which are governed by
dielectric inertia
both in whole and in part. The old method of demonstrating magnetism via iron filings is both horrible and an error
since the iron dust
undergoes magnetic induction. The only true and accurate way to see dielectricity & magnetism is with light, and the
ferrocell!

enormous.**

_“There are only four types of people in the world regarding discovery and invention:
The most common are those who watch and observe, and profit from invention and discovery; are intrigued by its

The second most common are those who dissuade others from invention and discovery, and try to prevent them both mentally
and
physically from discovery claiming: ‘this can lead to nowhere’, or ‘that course is a dead end, there is nothing there.’
The third most common are greedy and lustful inventors who desire only fame, profit, and acclaim, nothing matters but
any angle that
can be exploited to be used to exploit others for their own ends. Discovery is not an ends to these people, only a means
to exploit
others.
The fourth, and most rare are those who do not care about the first three types of people; these rare few have a vision

When dielectricity is radial along the Z-axis, there is low pressure circulatory XY-magnetism.
When dielectricity is accretional along the XY-axis in a solenoid, permanent magnet, electromagnet, AC lines, there is
dielectric
distension and magnetic high-pressure jets that circulate perpendicular to the dielectric inertial plane. (However
opposite, but appear
as perpendicular due to the binding system pressure geometries).
Anytime there is a XY-axis dielectric accretional formation, there is a hyperbolic conjugated spatially increasing
Z-axis of centrifugal
and centripetal magnetic flow as idealized in a magnet or AC current in the opposite direction of transmission. (Figures
1,2,3 below).

A counterspatial dielectric ‘sphere’ or volume is radial and electro-torsional, if increased and trapped, as in the case
of electrification
or a magnet; it is a centripetal, toroidal XY-axis inertia plane geometrically. A spatial macro-magnetic ‘sphere’ or
volume is
circulatory and spatio-accumulative if increased and trapped, as in the case of electrification, or a magnet; it is
centrifugal and
centripetal (polarized), and a double hyperbola geometrically, and a Z-axis accumulative-formative toroid.

To understand a magnetic spatio-accumulative Z-axis toroid, occurring simultaneous with a dielectric
counterspatial-accumulative
XY-axis (flattened) toroid is a fundamental necessity to understanding both electrical current and the geometry of
magnetism.

**Below: Left, looking inside a magnet showing the dielectric inertial plane in green and the reciprocating magnetism
along the
Z-axis expanding spatially as polarized in spin (however this polarization is a spatial reification of distension).
Image 1
showing current around a pair of AC lines, however as mentioned before, this same geometry applies to a permanent magnet
if you connect the two AC lines that are the felly of the dielectric inertial plane you have the geometry of a permanent
magnet.
Image 2 showing the same AC current / spatial-counterspatial geometry of a magnet. The closer the felly radius of the
dielectric plane (in AC lines) the greater the dielectricity, and likewise the less magnetism between the lines.**

Dielectricity is either the radial centerpoint upon which dielectro-electromagnetism geometry exists, or dielectricity
is the radial
accretion disk of sheer magnetism. In both cases, dielectricity is centripetal and conjugates electricity, or magnetism,
or both, or in
strong enough fields, creates matter itself, and is likewise, the basis of and in actually what is incorrectly called
the “strong nuclear
force” of which the mass particle is comprised.

Dielectricity conjugates radially and centripetally along the Z-axis in dielectro-electromagnetism where electricity and
magnetism
reciprocate as a vortex toroidal accretion disk along the X-Y axis. In the case of magnetism, dielectricity
centripetally moves along a
XY-axis as an accretion disk as magnetism moves centrifugally and centripetally along the Z-axis and spatially in a
curvilinear motion

towards centripetal return. In further retroduction, in the case of magnetism, the point at which the dielectric XY-axis
meets, given
sufficient electrification, is the point at which mass is formed.

**Below: Left, current moving thru lines in the opposite directions, causing magnetism to push alternating directions of
current
lines apart, this is the same phenomena seen in high power AC lines. Right, current flowing in the same direction,
causing the
lines to be pulled close together. Likewise happens in AC lines with there is too much dielectricity running thru them.
**

In terms of dielectro-electromagnetism vs. magnetism, the counterspatial component must exist at the Z-axis in the case
of dielectro-
electromagnetism, or at the XY axis in the case of magnetism in form of an accretion disk. In both cases, obviously, the
movement is
centripetal and inductive, or inversely, the EM components induce capacitance upon the dielectric, as in the case of
dielectro-
electromagnetism where perpetual reciprocating induction occurs in its natural and hyper-stable geometry.

In deduction, the radial centripetal dielectric can only exist along 2 simultaneous XY axes in the state of a magnet,
solenoid, or matter
itself, where the gravitational or mass geometry expands curvilinearly upon and along the Z-axis in accumulation.

A strong alternating magnetic pulsation along a magnetically ‘trapped’ dielectric accretion disk is the creation of
matter.

**Below: Left, a solenoid, and right a solenoid cross-section with magnetic flow shown in red.**

Dielectro-electromagnetism is on the counterspatial radial Z-axis and has electromagnetism at the spatial XY-axis. As
electromagnetism centrifugally reciprocates along the dielectric axis, dielectricity centripetally pulsates (is induced)
and radially
propagates. This mutual reciprocating coaxial geometry is natures most stable, and most common form of energy
transmission.
Magnetism at the circular spatial Z-axis has dielectricity at the counterspatial inertial plane of the XY-axis.
Electricity at the radial Z-axis has magnetism at the spatial circular XY-axis.
Electrification, or formation occurs at the Z-axis at which magnetism reciprocates along the X-axis upon the dielectric
reflective Y-
axis.
Gravity is at the counterspatial (directively, but accumulatively spatial, as mass) all-P radial-axis with magnetism,
electricity and
dielectricity comprising every point within its sphere. As mass centrifugally accumulates, gravitation centripetally
reciprocates within
the expanding radius of its field.

**Below: Left, magnetic field flow around radial AC current lines, current moving in opposite directions. Image 4 shows
magnetic field flow around a current moving in the same direction. Image 5 showing the dielectric inertial plant in
parallel to
the solenoidal windings and the resultant circular magnetic field flow around and thru the solenoid.**

Polarization of the radial centripetal counterspatial dielectric along the XY-axis as in the case of a magnet, or AC
current (figure 1), or
a solenoid (figure 5), causes magnetic high-pressure circulation along the spatially increasing Z-axis (figure 2). This
spatial distension
of the dielectric in electrification which is by nature counterspatial, causes increasing macro-magnetic preponderances
as is the case in
a permanent magnet, electromagnet, solenoid, AC current and likewise.

When dielectricity is allowed to propagate along one radial axis (figure 4), magnetism is circular and of low pressure,
as in the case of
DC lines or conventional stable inter-atomic volumes where dielectro-magnetic volume are both in equilibrium.

The missing secrets of this geometry as pertains gravity will be revealed in another work, suffice to say that since the
“strong nuclear
force” in fact is dielectricity and comprises much of all atomic matter, and while magnetism provides the magnitude to
mass, the
overwhelming predominance of any mass is an enormous amount of dielectric energy which, like gravity is centripetal.

No part of electromagnetism (incorrectly thought of) is in one or two planes, both operate in a spiral vortex.
Conjugating pressure
spirals of oppositional movement define all wave-fields. It is likewise, as stated, impossible for “electromagnetism” to
exist without a
center radial dielectric conductor, acting as counterspatial axis for EM reciprocation.

other,
and operate in a binding system.**

**Gravity**

_Laithwaite's efforts to show the weight loss of the gyroscopic devices he built were met with 'utter hostility'. He
retired from Imperial
College in 1981 pretty much in disgrace. But he never lost his fascination for gyroscopes. "None of my critics could
ever explain to me
how a 50 pound spinning wheel loses weight,"_ **_- Prof. Eric Laithwaite_**

_"Supposing that the bodies act upon the surrounding space causing curving of the same, it appears to my simple mind
that the curved
spaces must react on the bodies, and producing the opposite effects, straightening out the curves. Since action and
reaction are
coexistent, it follows that the supposed curvature of space is entirely impossible - But even if it existed it would not
explain the motions
of the bodies as observed. Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed,
and its
assumption dispenses with space curvature._ **_All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion_**_. So
are all attempts to
explain the workings of the universe without recognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it
plays in the
phenomena." "My second discovery was of a physical truth of the greatest importance. As I have searched the entire
scientific records
in more than a half dozen languages for a long time without finding the least anticipation, I consider myself the
original discoverer of
this truth, which can be expressed by the statement: There is no energy in matter other than that received from the
environment." —_
**_Nikola Tesla_**

Since this is an article about magnetism, mass / gravity only rates for a brief mention here.

Gravity’s genesis from dielectricity must be a zero movement fulcrum compression where matter is spontaneously generated
at the
hub of the rebounding inertial plane. As is the case, weight is location specific, and medium specific (water etc.),
likewise rotationally
specific [in the Ether medium] (gyroscopic).

Just as the dielectric inertial plane (‘Bloch wall’ in incorrect nomenclature) is immediately self-seeking when two
magnets are brought
together, so too are any two masses at which time the center of gravity shifts. Dielectricity is to gravitation as
electricity is to
magnetism.

The current concept that the cosmos and the interatomic model is or are ‘mostly empty space’ is the greatest mental
perversity
perpetrated upon humans as against the genuine rational and logical understanding of the mechanics of the cosmos.

Humanity holds many insane notions about gravity, that it has a locus, but a field is well defined. If one were able to
stand within a
small bubble inside the center of the Earth or Sun, they would be weightless. Weight is location and medium specific.
So, being at the
center of gravity for a stellar mass (hypothetically) how is it then that one is weightless? For the very same reason
that there is no
magnetism along the fine line of the dielectric inertial plane of even the most very powerful neodymium magnets. This
discussion is
saved for another article.

Even the gyroscopic precessional movement of the earth is in fact due to the centripetal magnetic returning vortex which
displaces the
geographic north from the magnetic pole. Mass creation is from a dielectric centripetal termination through a peak
magnetic aperture.

**Below: Force Unification Diagram showing the nature of fields, their terminations, and accumulations regarding the
four
forces in the cosmos; how they interact and likewise their conjugate natures. Dielectricity and magnetism are
co-principles;
electricity and gravity/mass are secondary attributes created between interactions of magnetism and dielectricity.**

Matter does not attract matter, rather the “strong nuclear force” which is in fact simplex dielectricity that causes an
accumulative
centripetal Ether vortex which accelerates masses towards each other in equilibrium seeking pressure gradients.

Magnetic polarity is centrifugally spatial and centripetally counterspatial, just as the two other “poles” are
dielectrically accumulative
in the counterspatial and gravitationally accumulative in the spatial, as matter itself. This double conjugated
zero-null fulcrum of both
the magnetic and the dielectric-gravitational, are radiative and generative both spatially and likewise counterspatially
in their field.

Matter and magnetism, both being polarized, accumulate spatially while their inertial pairs electricity and
dielectricity accumulate in
the counterspatial.

**_Magnetomotive force: F= Phi x R
Dielectric force = Phi/LxT (Weber per centimeter-second)
Magnetic force = Psi/LxT (Coulombs per centimeter-second)
Electromagnetic induction: E (volts) = Phi/time
Magneto-dielectric induction: I (Amps) = Psi/time_**

All fields can be typified and explained very simply. All fields, whether gravitational, dielectric, magnetic, or
charged are spatial to
counterspatial, or counterspatial to spatial imbalances against an equilibrium fulcrum. Either magnetic against
dielectric, or otherwise.
Spatial-counterspatial electro-geometric imbalances are the premise and definition of any and all fields.

All induction is centripetal, magnetism and gravity alike. Gravimetric induction is a centripetal pressure gradient
sourced at the inertial
plane of the atomic nucleal mass whose vacuum pressure gradient is omnidirectional but propagated along the inertial
plane towards
the nucleal.

_Unlike magnetism dielectric energy is forced or compressed inwards rather than outwards. Dielectric lines of force push
inward
into internal space and along axis, rather than pushed outward broadside to axis as in the magnetic field. Because_ *
*_the lines are
mutually repellent_** _certain amounts of broadside or transverse motion can be expected but the phenomena is basically
radial. This
gives rise to an interesting paradox that will be noticed with capacity. This is that the smaller the space bounded by
the conducting
structure the more energy that can be stored. This is the exact opposite of magnetism. With magnetism, the units volumes
of energy
can be thought of as working in parallel but the unit volumes of energy in association with dielectricity can be thought
of as working
in series_**_. –E. Dollard_**

All matter is in motion, whether evident or not, creating phase coherent electrical archetypes in imitation of nature or
as exists in
nature are all equalization seeking pressure gradients of fields, electrical, dielectric, magnetic, and gravitational.
Humanity is
fascinated by “magnets” (as I have been my entire life) only that they are an electrical gyroscope with their own
inertial plane,
magnetic axis, and macro-atomic influences which have amazed mankind since the discovery of the loadstone. The creation
of a
dielectric ‘gyroscope’ of electromotive momentum by electrification creates a spatially expansive axis of circular
centripetal and
centrifugal momentum along the perpendicular axis to the dielectric inertial plane.
An entirely new science will be born one day, which investigates magneto-dielectrical electro-gyroscopic principles.
Already they
are being studied very loosely as in the situation of electro-motive forces and magneto-motive forces. Circular
radiative magneto-
motive force is like a multi-plane gyroscope, which expands along the Z-axis perpendicular to the XY-dielectric in the
case of a
magnet. In knowing the energy vector of any component of fields, determining the location of the other is simplex
enough, regardless
if radial, circular, spatial or counterspatial, it’s perpendicular can easily be known.

**Below: Left, archetypes of spatial-counterspatial energy. Right, simplex magnetic and dielectric generation formulas.

The magnetic “flywheel” of magnetic motion is spatially expansive along the Z-axis with perfect gyroscopic perfection at
the angle of
90 degrees to the inertial plane of dielectricity at the XY-axis of the “magnet”.

Precessional movement of the dielectric occurs with magnetism over time against the dielectric plane at 90 degrees,
which manifest
electrification at 90 degrees to the dielectric plane. Likewise is the case of moving a magnet against the dielectric
plane. This
dielectrical torque is and causes electrification.

Overcoming the magneto-dielectric field momentum at the atomic volume is discharge; and this is the wrong conception of
‘electrons’
or ‘discharge carriers’. This is exactly like pulling on rubber bands until they snap their field lines in electrical
transmission or vacuum
tubes.

Electrification of a ferrous or iron-neodymium mass creates the magneto-dielectric stable “magnet” due to the irons
magneto-dielectric
‘elasticity’, which is of course, a dielectrically saturated object with dominant dielectricity with coincidental
attributional magnetism.
We only consider it a “magnet” such that dielectricity is centripetal, counterspatial, inertial, and radial, or from
human senses, a
conventional ‘unknown’ dominant force.

**Below: Understand a superluminal dielectric radial plane, a ‘charging gyroscope’ of pure potential. This is the basis
behind
most of Tesla’s works, comprehension and manipulation of dielectricity, not electricity.**

The magneto-dielectric gyroscopic axis contracts and become coherent along and radially around the Z-axis in
electrification in
creating a magnet, these conjugating pairs of electrical archetypes create natures golden section geometry both
spatially and in charge
dissipation as they reciprocate against one another and thru themselves. The inertial planes of momentum of both the
magnetic and the
dielectric are distended in the creation of a “magnet” creating edge-point stability, identical to a child’s gyroscope
which can balance
perfectly, a large mass at the imaginary point of a needle by mere centripetal-centrifugal magneto-dielectric momentum.
However the
heresy of GR and QM is that all atoms are 99.9999999999% empty space, which is both insane, illogical, and contradicts
all known
observation and offends the common sense of an illiterate person. Einstein’s dumb giant, GR, still roams the lands
stepping on
people’s necks.

**Below: Electrification in the creation of a magnet causes inertial dielectric coherent dominance by centripetal
electrical
momentum. This creates, in perfectly logical order, a model the same as this charged atomic ion:**

**The dielectric inertial plane, or “Bloch wall”. Correcting the magnetic ‘domain wall’ fallacy**

_“What is perchance, in all human history of examining what a magnet is, we have been looking at a horses ass rather
than the horses
mouth? This I assure you is in fact the case.”_ **_- Author_**

The insane premise today in looking up the definition of a “domain wall” or “Bloch wall” is: “A domain wall: interface
separating
magnetic domains. A Bloch wall is a narrow transition region at the boundary between”. This is nonsense and reifies the
false concept
that this moving divider is like an imaginary cage that separates the lions from their pray (CW and CCW) at the zoo.
This dielectric
inertial plane is the basis for understanding dielectricity, counterspace, the creation of a magnet, AC transmission
lines, and the entire
spatial-counterspatial magneto-dielectric geometry that governs the entire cosmos. That modern science had only devoted
an insane
and incorrect tiny footnote to this only shows how very little current science understands the magnetic and dielectric
universe.

The Bloch wall of any magnet is, in simple, the dielectric accretion disk. This is the very reason why there is
absolutely no magnetic
attraction at the dielectric plane of even an extremely powerful magnet. Magnetism does not exist at this very narrow
accretion disk of
centripetal dielectricity. This dielectric pressure equilibrium is a necessitated entity in any magnetic system,
permanent or otherwise.
There cannot exist any magnetic fulcrum without a dielectric inertial plane. In bringing two magnets together, this
inertial plane will
immediately shift from the middle of one magnet to the center between the two as the inverse spins of the magnetic
inductions self-
void at the counterspatial dielectric inertial plane. An incapacity to grasp this visually and mentally is a permanent
roadblock to any
comprehension.

This dielectric inertial plane is the counterspatial XY-axis of non-opposition between magnetic circular reciprocation
centrifugally and
centripetally, which create, as is necessitated, binary CW and CCW field lines of motional disturbance. At the
dielectric inertial line
the two reciprocating magnetic field gradients are nullified and in equilibrium.

In motion, force has the illusion of existence. In inertia, force exists as a potentiality without the illusion of
motion. When an event
takes place "anywhere" in the universe the concept of that event is simultaneously measured in inertia "throughout" the
cosmos of
counterspace.

The inertial line is that hypothetical line of absolute non-opposition between the oscillations of the two opposing
forces of motion. At
the inertial line the two opposing forces are neutralized and in equilibrium. At the inertial line there is no force
back of motion but
there is the impetus of the magnetic radiative pulsations which continues motion across the inertial plane without
force.

That state of motion which continues its inertial radial motion without force-back from it should be known as inertial
energy. This
inertia can of course be brought into precession in the case of electrification production, or in the termination of
electrification in the
creation of a permanent magnet or electromagnet.

“Magnetic Inductance is thus a dimensional relation for the magnetic properties of the Ether, and dielectric capacitance
is a
counterspatial relation for the dielectric properties of the Ether. Inductance and Capacitance are the application of
metrical
relationships to certain attributes of the Ether. Both additive in (magnetism) either +space and +time, and the other (
dielectricity)
multiplicative in either –space and –time.

For the magnetic induction the Ether modality relation is the magnetic “Permeability”, for the dielectric induction the
Etheric relation
is the dielectric “Permittivity”. These were coined by Oliver Heaviside. Permeability is denoted as Mu, the Permittivity
as Epsilon.
These two relations represent the “Magnetic Inductivity” and the “Dielectric Inductivity”.

The reason Rawls and Davis wrongly and correctly thought that magnetism traveling from pole to pole actually traveled to
the outside
center of the magnet is that the magnetic pressures insufficient to clear the dielectric accretion disk is directed
towards the boundary
inertial dielectric plane at which it returns with least resistance. Depending on gauss rating and the geometry of the
magnet upon
centrifugal ejection, a large portion of the magnetism returns at the CW or CCW pole and a large portion of the
magnetism with
insufficient escape pressure is directed at the outer centerpoint of the magnet where the dielectric inertial accretion
disk ‘reaccepts’ the
magnetism as necessitated by field pressure gradients. This is the reason behind their incorrect yet partially accurate
observations.

**Below: Centrifugal intermediate pressure gradients with insufficient velocity to overcome the felly of the dielectric
inertial
plane.**

The dielectric inertial plane of any magnet is the fulcrum and reciprocating ‘crank shaft’ at which magnetism rebounds
and begins
again.

When two magnets are brought together, the dielectric inertial plane will immediately shift to the centerpoint between
the two
magnets. This centripetal self-centering attribute of dielectricity behaves in an identical fashion to gravity, which,
when two masses
are brought together, the center of gravity will shift. That dielectricity is the point causation for the creation of
mass/gravity is no
coincidence in this phenomena.

**Dielectric torque in the creation of electrification from magnetism**

When a magnet is spun against a dielectric reflector, not only is there torsional inertia against the dielectric but at
quarter turns there is
dielectric vacuum torsion on the dielectric reflector.

The dielectric inertial torque is a breaking upon the superluminal dielectric at the atomic scale within the
inter-atomic mageto-
dielectric volume. This breaking and vacuum torque occurring at quarter turns is the point of electrification. This
oscillatory
compression and vacuum pressure on the dielectric inter-atomic inertia is the production of electrification.

Magnetic oscillations against the centripetal counterspatial radial dielectric on the inter-atomic dielectric of the
dielectric reflector
(copper, silver etc.) cause both superluminal dielectric precession, breaking and quarter-turn dielectric vacuum
perturbations at the Z-
axis of the dielectric gyroscopic motions. This combinational dielectric torque creates electrification at 90 degrees to
the interatomic
dielectric Z-axis along the temporary XY-axis of the dielectric plane, or as meant radially along the ‘conductor’.

**Below: The process of electrification in creating a permanent magnet, or the process of dielectric coherence from
induction.**

**Below: Likewise again, the process of electrification in creating a permanent magnet, or the process of dielectric
coherence
from induction. Coherent dielectric capacitance or increased dielectric capacitance with resultant magneto-dielectric
coherent
conjugation in a binding system.**

The atomic nucleal is the axle or hub of the dielectric radial charging gyroscopic inertial plane. These processional
oscillations caused
by magnetism against this hub causes dielectric perturbations and breaking leading to electrification. As is known,
magnetism and the
dielectric both move 180 degrees from one another, dielectricity counterspatially and in the case of charging, magnetism
moves
spatially in conjugated hyperbolas. However since they are in bounding seems, they appear geometrically perpendicular,
but are not.
The axle of the dielectric in the magnetic reflector (a reflector that is dielectrically ‘inelastic’) is at every
location within the medium
as against magnetic compressional torque of the dielectric inertial plane.

Since gravity and dielectricity are conjugated pairs like electricity and magnetism, the magnetic oscillations against
the dielectric axle
is the hub of electrification, which is caused from precessional vibration from the magnetic oscillations.

Dielectricity is a superluminal radial and counterspatial inertial plane in the inter-atomic; the precessional torque (
breaking) forces
placed upon this inertial dielectric plane by magnetism causes luminal electrification ‘remnants’ from this breaking
force. The
superluminal dielectric moving in a direction of opposition to the magnetic spatial field is the electromotive force in
the creation of
electricity. As dielectricity moves away from the magnetic, these luminal velocity electrifications are created from the
breaking-torque
against the dielectric like a stone creating ripples in a placid pond which has surface tension (dielectrical inertial
tension, i.e. the Ether
membrane).

Magnetism breaking upon the dielectric inertial plane registers that superluminal breaking out in electrification. The
pulsating
breaking from magnetic movement against the dielectric reflector necessitates this inter-atomic dielectric volume to
emanate a
polarized charge resultantly.

The dielectric “flywheel” of centripetal gyroscopic inertia is superluminal, and its inertial tension is enormous. The
acting magnetic
distension-breaking upon the dielectric and vacuum attraction at quarter-cycles is the premise for and of all
electrification.

Quite literally magnetic polarization torque-breaking upon the dielectric centripetal gyroscopic inter-atomic produces
the Ether in
electrification, a state of dynamic polarization. The dielectric is the inertial counterspatial radial and centripetal
intermediary for the
creation of electrification; or inversely from electrification, the production of magnetism wherein electricity
terminates. Dielectricity
terminates in and as mass, incorrectly deemed the “strong nuclear force”.

The dielectric inertial torque occurring from magnetic-dielectric-magnetic-dielectric (as the sweeping magnet passes the
conductor at
both fields and at both sides of its inertial plane) oscillations is breaking the inter-atomic dielectric equilibrium
causing perpendicular
electrification to occur at the lateral gyroscopic-radial dielectric inertial plane at the felly, or radius of the
membrane torque.

**Below: Geometry for a permanent magnet, electrification, and AC transmission lines (even TEM, however TEM is much
harder to represent in 3D) are all conjugate relationships. Centrifugal magnetism in blue arrows, centripetal in red,

conductor.**

If you take a steel disk against the side of a strong magnetic block, you will notice that it’s impossible to get it to
adhere in parallel.
This is specifically because the nature of the steel disk is a spatial magnetic induction (not a magnet, but
magnetically induced)
polarization (XY axis) as against the radial centripetal dielectric. If however you attempt to stick a needle at the
center of the dielectric
plane of the same magnet it will touch without any effort, this is specifically due to the radial nature of the needle
which is ‘pointing’
centripetally towards the gravitative-dielectric center.

Electrification requires a dielectric reflector, and any medium, which can absorb light, is a dielectric capacitor,
incorrectly called an
“insulator”, such as glass.

Gravitational polarization is the principle behind gyroscopic weight loss. All weight is location and medium specific.
High rotational
gyroscopic masses moving centrifugally as against the Ether field of gravity which is centripetal, changes both the
center and
geometry of mass of the gyroscopic mass in motion. The weight loss has nothing to do with torque or angular momentum.

Gravity is centripetal, gyroscopic motion is centrifugal, THIS is why the flywheel "loses weight”; weight is location
specific AND
medium specific. In the case of the gyroscope, its movement is counter to its field.

The insane postulation of GR that “gravitational mass was the same as inertial mass” is incorrect, inertial mass is
centrifugal and
motion based, whereas gravity is centripetal and dielectric in basis, as the terminator of the dielectric. The former is
a motional replica
of the later. Gravitation and acceleration are identical in that both are based in fields and centripetal towards an
inertial plane of lowest
pressure, however centrifugal inertia is motional and polarized. Polarized inertial plane torque produces
electrification in the case of a
dielectric reflector; likewise polarization can create the illusion of centripetal gravitation inversely by centrifugal
inertial polarization
of a mass.

The appearance of luminal electricity at the point of electrification from inertial plane torque is due to the breaking
entering into
dimensionality. This dielectric resistance, or spatial friction from two oppositional forces (dielectricity and
magnetism, counterspatial
and spatial, over time) is the creation of perpendicularly propagating electrification. It is not the case that
dielectricity exists in reverse
time, but in counter-time, conventionally meaning no time.

**Below: You see modeled how the dielectric inertial plane is torqued from magnetic perturbations in electrification**

**Below: Magnetic movement over time in the creation of electrification against the dielectric inertial plane in the

**Below: In the diagrams below you can see in chain 1 thru 4, of a standard copper ring dropping at gravity against a
neodymium magnetic field. At 1 there is magnetic constriction and dielectric envelopment about to occur. At frame 2,
with
dielectric in perfect line with dielectric (copper ring) there is conventional magnetic field geometry with an extended
dielectric
ring as being extended from the copper ring, which is undergoing dielectric dilation and magnetic contraction. At frame
3
there is likewise dielectric distension since, unlike frame 1 where the copper ring has yet to be mostly or fully
dielectrically
induced, in frame 3 there is greater resistance to escape than in frame 1 upon entering, with the copper ring well
within the
dielectric field of the coppers induction, as further evidenced by frame 4 where figure-8 shaped dielectric channels
still exist
from the magnetic XY-axis of its inertial plane down to the still-induced copper ring which is compressing the magnetic
field
as it passing finally thru. Figure 5 is that of a superconductive ring which is falling under gravity upon the same
magnet, but
at 6 has reached full immersion, and is returning as if falling upon a spring, this being from the superconductor, which
is a
super-magnetic-reflector. It cannot sink into the magnetic field.**

The most insane premise of all atomic models, either the debunked ‘cloud’ model or the planetary model both, is their
mutual
vociferous agreement that “most of an atom is 99.999999% empty space” (between the nucleus and the charged(ing)
boundaries). This
cannot be enjoined, logically or experimentally and is contrary to all observed phenomena and experimentation. Between
the nucleus
and the charging boundaries is the spatial and counterspatial ‘air’ (Ether), which, analogously, props up the highly
stable (in most
cases) atomic structure, that being magnetism and the dielectricity. The rotary inner vortexes inside (rather between)
the atomic
‘sphere’ (complex atomic geometries actually) is a micro-turbine which induces charge, discharges, has capacitance,
inductance, and
has counter-to-counterspatial magnetism to prevent complete atomic dismemberment.
The atomic radius of different elements is specifically related to the magnetic-dielectric pressures within the atomic
geometry. The
larger noble gasses have greater internal magnetism, low dielectricity and resultantly have very low reactivity with
other elements.
The nucleal and the geometric charged (discharging) boundaries are atomic terminals, like a battery. Electrification
affects this spatial-
counterspatial geometry and likewise affects the spatial magnetism within it. Even in the ‘encapsulated balloon’ model
of the atom of
QM, the supposed ‘balloon’ has no ‘air’. The particle theory of atomic geometry must be summarily dismissed; it is by
its very nature
nothing more than rehashed Greek Atomism.

**This section will be greatly expanded in further editions.**

Its best to ideate the inter-atomic structure between the nucleus and its outer discharging perimeters as the
magneto-dielectric plane-
field, or ‘volume’, or ‘base’. Again, the notion that this inter-atomic field plane is “empty, absolutely nothing” as
posited by GR and
QM is a purely an insane concept and demonstrably false.

The formerly unexplainable varying atomic volumes are easily explained by the inter-atomic magneto-dielectric
plane-fields, which
undergo capacitance and induction pressure-gradients within the atomic geometry.

There are only two models of the universe, one based upon mathematical abstractions which created non-existent discrete
particles of
a myriad nature which mediate charges, fields, magnetism and electricity and have no future, no part of physics; and
lastly the
electrical and field model of the universe that is as simple as it is consistent, logical, rational and explains all
phenomena in the
universe with simplicity, not complexity. There is only one mass-particle, and all fields are as per the Ether. All else
is a
misunderstanding of time-space versors, charge-discharge false dualities, and spin polarities.

Nothing in the entire universe could exist if the proton-neutron-electron model of the universe were accurate. Erase
from your mind
forever the false conception that atoms are made up of spinning charged beads, this planetary model of the atom is a
psychosis. The
inter-atomic ‘space’ of the atom is completely filled with magnetism and dielectricity. The necessary unexplained and
endless
phenomena of elements and compounds is fully explained by the electro-conductor-magneto-dielectric model of the atom.
Counterspatial-spatial-spatial-counterspatial (discharge-plane, charging nucleus, inter-atomic-magnetic, inter-atomic
counterspatial
dielectric respectively). This **double-conjugate pair** is the last remaining missing puzzle to be finally brought
forward about the
atomic structure of the atom for the first time ever, and lastly for all, explains unexpected phenomena, reactivity,
electrification,
conductivity, permittivity, and susceptibility. In simple, the electro-discharge and magneto-dielectric induction and
capacitance.

Electrification, in short, terminates in the inter-atomic structure thereby creating a macro-magnetic field; this is the
final
degenerative/radiative stop for the electrical charge. In the creation of electricity and in the nature of the atom
there are but four real
factors, two spatial, and two counterspatial. Dielectricity and the discharge plane in counterspace; finally the
magnetic and charged
nucleus (‘conductor’) in space. In electrification, the discharge plane is the electrical (so-called ‘electron’), the
superluminal spinning

charged nucleus is the conductor, the dielectric is the radial counterspatial versor of the Ether between the magnetic
and the conductor,
as found in the atomic model as the inter-atomic dielectric ‘volume’, and the magnetic, however in the case of the
magnet the field
itself is in motion, not the magnet unless otherwise impelled to do so. The two unreal factors in electrification are
time and space,
which are abstractions and spatial vectors in the creation of electricity. So we have magnetism, dielectricity,
electrification, nucleal
gravity, the discharge plane, and the conductor, lastly remaining in electrical production are time and space.

Since the nucleus and the geometrically charged (discharging) boundaries are atomic terminals, like a battery,
electrification in the
creation of a magnet is discharged into the inter-atomic dielectric, such that the dielectric field terminates on
conductors, in this case
the nucleus and the nucleal discharge plane (‘electron field’), which thereby causes inter-atomic contraction and
macro-magnetic
‘expulsion’. The displacement current or dielectric induction is resultant from the ferrous electrification. The
magnetic field always
self-terminates and the dielectric begins and ends on the charging and discharging terminals.

Just as electricity flows in the space between the wires, the ferrous electrification in the creation of a magnet flows
between the atomic
terminals of the nucleus and the discharge plane within the inter-atomic magneto-dielectric field planes, the presumed,
but utterly
wrong, “massive empty space of the atomic model” as hatched from the insane minds of GR and QM.

All atomic operations are the same as the macro world of electrical theory. Atoms are a balance of electricity/charge (
as mediated by
the nucleus) and kept in balance by the interspatial dielectric and the inter-atomic spatial magnetic. There are however
no electrons,
this fundamental error carries on today. Induction, charge, capacitance are all mediated by the Ether from the atomic
field pressures all
the way to high voltage power lines. This correct model of the atomic solves the never-answered conundrum as to why (
non-existent)
electrons don’t spiral into to the nucleus, or in this case charge disappears in the nucleus. Charge is mono-binary, or
an extended one,
just as polarity in a magnet is a perceptual abstraction of spatially inverse spin. In which case the atomic model can
be reduced purely
to charge-discharge and magneto-dielectric all of which keep in place atomic electro-diamagnetic equilibrium in check,
except in
instances of Magneto-Isotopes where alteration is possible. Ferro-atomic dielectric saturation occurs at the point of
electrification
wherein which the charged atomic geometry is forced to expel magnetism from its magneto-atomic field-planes.

The magneto-dielectric-charge of the atom has a sponge-inside-a-balloon model as the nature of the atom. Analogously the
tiny
sponge inside the balloon is the superluminally moving charging nucleus which can be saturated or discharged from
electrical
induction (or as an isotope), likewise the ‘air’ inside the balloon being the conjugate equilibrium forces of
counterspatial dielectricity
and spatial magnetism. The skin being the electrical charge (no electrons needed, a foolish notion which must be
eventually dismissed
and long ago dismissed by Heaviside, Tesla and others) which both can be dielectrically charged-discharged and of which
the balloon
can be squeezed and distorted to create macro-magnetic phenomena (atomic orbital geometries) as in the case of a ferrous
mass; as
would be analogous to letting out an unending supply of ‘air’ (Ether) out of the balloon resulted from electrical
saturation and
dielectric expulsion of the magnetism.
The planetary model of the atom is nonsense, and has long ago since been disproven. The Schordinger / Born ‘cloud’ model
of the
atom is likewise nonsensical and cannot account for the magneto-diaelectric pressure gradients witnessed from atomic
charge,
discharges, and phenomena manifest from extreme cold and heat. The only correct model of the atom which is
representative of
experimentation, logic and consistency is the magneto-dielectric gravitational sponge inside balloon model of the atom.
The supposed
“strong nuclear force” is in fact of course merely the stable dielectric which has terminated into the creation of mass
and resultantly
the creation of centripetal gravity fields. Mass creation is the ‘negative terminal’ for the creation of mass from
dielectricity, just as
magnetism is the ‘negative terminal’ of terminating electrification.

**Below: Defunct models of atomic geometry still taught in colleges and elsewhere. All completely atomistic,
materialistic by
nature. The correct atom is purely magneto-dielectric, gravitational and entirely full of magneto-dielectricity in its
volume.
The nonsensical premise of GR and QM that the atom is 99.99999999% empty is purely farcical, as established by Tesla and
others.**

Magneto-isotopic is the more correct analogous manner of speaking of elemental magnetization as regards permanent Ferro-
magnetism. Electrical susceptibility of the ferrous material to hold a dielectric charge, its magneto-dielectric
‘elasticity’, and become
dielectrically capacitant and macro-magnetically altered is specific to certain materials and composites which should
designate a
different class of nucleal-isotopes. Not ones based upon proton or neutron count and nucleal radioactivity but
magneto-dielectric
structure making the same elements a specific subset of elemental magneto-isotopes. Logically there must be two variants
of isotopes
designated to any element. Nucleal-isotopics and magneto-isotopics. All isotopes are connotatively out of ideal
equilibrium, in either
the nucleus or in charge and respective magneto-dielectric geometries.
The very premise of classifying another state of matter, plasma, is in this arena of reclassification, which of course
is merely just
ionized gas of a unique charge. Plasma is just a dielectrically charged filament which conducts dielectricity in a
similar manner to
conventional conductors, however since Plasma is the most abundant elemental form in the universe, our metal conductors
are in fact
the ‘unconventional conductors’. Plasma, same as a permanent magnet, is just disequilibrium of the magneto-dielectrics
of its system,
either stable or unstable with a unique phenomena characteristic to its uniquely charged or discharging (both) state.
Either states
involve dominances of dielectrically higher capacitance, or dominances of higher magnetic induction.

Protons are magnetically dominant particles since their superluminal velocity within the nucleal structure mediate out
electrification and discharge (again, no electrons) in the atomic system. This system of discharge is from the
superluminal nucleus
creating charge in its movement against the inter-atomic dielectric inertial planes, which is the source for the entire
fallacy of GR and
QM that there are “fields of electrons” and the long ago debunked “shells of electrons”. This is patently absurd and
Tesla and his
kinsmen knew this fact. This array of superluminal protons (or one in the case of hydrogen) are inducing electrification
within and
against the dielectric atomic volume with likewise resultant spatial reactions inside the interatomic as mediated by
magnetism within
that volume.
One can think of the nucleus as the superluminal prime mover of an electrification system which is also the charging
inducer
causing inter-atomic magneto-dielectrical atomic geometries to form. All mass particles (protons and neutrons) are the
stable
convergences of terminating dielectricity; however protons are magnetically induced particles and neutrons are
dielectrically
capacitant particles. This is why helium has a much smaller atomic radius than does hydrogen, which contains no
neutrons.

The notion that neutrons are converted into protons via “beta decay” and protons into neutrons by “inverse beta decay”
is an absurdity.
Neutrons convert into protons from dielectric (electrostatic) discharge from excessive magnetic self-induction (
so-called beta decay)
and protons become neutrons by excess electric discharge, or as meant depolarization, and increased dielectric
capacitance which all
mass particles are by nature, the stable convergence of terminating dielectricity. Protons and neutrons are both the
only particles in
any atom, and both are one and the same particle wrongly differentiated as wholly unique, but only from the perspective
of their
respective induction or capacitance.

The cult of quantum states: “Protons are known to transform into neutrons through the process of electron capture (also
called
inverse beta decay). Neutrons can convert back to protons through beta decay, a common form of radioactive decay.”
However this is
all patently false. The correction is that protons transform into neutrons by way of dielectric capacitance (there are
no electrons), and
neutrons can convert back into protons by means of a net loss of dielectric charge and therefore once again become
magnetically
induced (but this magnetic induction is merely about the particle, not within it, just like a conventional magnet)
either in the atomic
system or in total atomic ejection these same neutrons become protons because their superluminal particle geometries (
not their
ejection speeds) cause magnetic self-induction polarized dominance, and conversion or re-conversion into a proton.
Neutrons are the generative particle and protons are the result of electrical charge polarization (in the making)
terminating about
and coincident to the neutron to create a proton which is polarized and the creator of, in its superluminal nucleal
platform as atomic
dynamo, the charging ‘prime mover’ polarization particle of the atomic system. However as is the case the free
‘neutron’ (rather mass
particle) is naturally magnetically induced and the premise for and of the hydrogen atom, the most prolific element in
the cosmos. As
is typical, humans see the proton, as the ‘positive’ (not just in the sense of creating charges) particle, and the
neutron as the do-nothing
‘neutral’ particle. However the case is just the opposite, the neutron is the first fundamental mass element, and the
proton is the
necessitated conjugate dominant particle in the universe (ala hydrogen) due to this fundamental mass element (the
‘neutron’) being
immediately self-induced magnetically as a solitary particle and therefore the genesis of hydrogen. Just as a DC
transmission line
creates a magnetic dominance around the electrical transmission, so too does the fundamental mass particle create its
own induced
magnetic attribute, thereby creating the proton, and hence hydrogen.
As even GR and QM know, a neutron exists for very little time in the free universe before immediately becoming a proton,
this
time lapse is the building up of magnetic-induction of the dielectrically dominant neutron in rapidly becoming a
polarized and
charging system (in itself) proton. The only logical possibility to have a charging system, a power generator with a
single mass
particle, the proton, as elemental hydrogen, is by having this fundamental mass particle having a dominant magnetic
induction about
itself and its magneto-dielectric totality in nature is the genesis of the hydrogen system. The most elemental and
simplex dynamo in
the cosmos.

The reason hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is merely a single proton (likewise the smallest dynamo
that exists)
then becomes extremely obvious. The magnetically induced and dominant proton operating as a superluminal dynamo creates
an
atomic volume of dielectricity with resultant electrification or charge to maintain its homeostasis. Dielectricity
literally creates charge,

or dielectricity by using a mass particle (dielectric in nature, its stable terminus) and its coincidental induced
magnetism over space
and time to create more dielectricity. For one to create one (itself creating more of itself) dielectricity uses the
mass particle
magnetically induced over a rate of polarization-over-time to create more of itself. A likewise relationship exists in
magnetism to
create additional magnetism. This is the conjugate nature of the cosmos.

There is only one particle in the universe, the mass-particle, with two modal attributes of existence. QM explanation of
neutron to
proton conversion is a pathetic farce, is nonsensical in the extreme. There is “beta decay”, there are no electrons. The
universe is
divinely simple in its makeup.

The inter-atomic plane, or volume between discharge (‘electron field’) and the nucleus is purely magneto-dielectric in
nature and
necessarily is how and where electrification causes inter-atomic contraction. The inter-atomic spaces (as meant the
Ether), contrary to
current conception, are in fact not an insulator at all.

Electrification causes inter-atomic convergence of the dielectric into the counterspatial, and conjugate divergence of
the magnetic
which circulates around the magnet. The movement of this magnetic field over time against a reflector which is
dielectric, is
electrification.

The CNAP (convoluted nonsense and poppycock) of P-orbitals, atomic orbitals, has nothing to do with non-existent
electrons rather
with geometric (see diagram) representations of magneto-dielectrical geometric discharging barriers which conform
geometrically to
the nucleal mass particles (either magnetically induced protons or dielectrically capacitant /dominant neutrons).

Dielectric reflectors are the best ‘conductors’ such that their dielectrically charged over-abundance of excess neutrons
in the nucleuses
act to form the expulsion of electricity in creation from a rotating magnetic field. Such as silver, copper, gold, and
platinum.

The dielectrically predominant nature of iron and its specific atomic geometry allows iron to be the most ideal element
to undergo
magneto-dielectric ‘elasticity’ and produce macro-magnetic phenomena. Bismuth for example is so extremely diamagnetic
due to its
over-abundance of excess neutrons (83 protons vs. 126 neutrons) in the nucleus and its atomic geometry.

Hydrogen’s atomic radius is 53pm versus that of helium’s 31pm, while containing 3 more mass particles, helium has a much
smaller
atomic radius due to neutron dielectric counterspatial contraction which hydrogen lacks completely with its predominant
magnetic
atomic volume from one proton. These models only apply to certain elements, but is aptly demonstrated in the most
simplex elements
where complex proton, neutron and magneto-dielectric forces convolute the geometry of larger elements beyond the point
of simplex
demonstration. Even oxygen has a smaller atomic radius than that of Hydrogen, with a diameter of 48pm.

The presumed ‘discharging plane’ of the correct atomic model derives its discharging planes (wrongly and popularly
‘electron
orbitals’) from the respective spatial and counterspatial nature of the inter-atomic magnetism and dielectricity
respectively, which
interact with the superluminal rotating nucleus to create inter-atomic pressure gradients of discharge which irrational
science wrongly
conceives of as “electron orbitals”

**Below: Defunct models of atomic geometry. The bead model, the wave model, and additionally the ‘cloud’ model. By
reifying
the non-existent electron as a bead, a wave function, and a ‘cloud’, quantum has made its nonsense unfalsifiable by
declaring
the non-existent electron (really the discharging plane from the inter-atomic magneto-dielectric volume) is bead, wave,
and a
cloud. This type of hyperbolic insanity cannot enjoined.**

There are only two forms of particle radiation, alpha and neutron radiation. Beta, gamma, and X-ray radiations are
dielectro-
electromagnetic emissions from magneto-dielectrically unstable elements, they are not particle based. The dielectrically
charged over-
abundance of excess neutrons in some elements such as Uranium and Plutonium are neutron radiators specifically due to
the fact that
dielectricity is counterspatial and neutrons are spatially charged particles with dielectric counterspatial capacitance.
Given this fact the
spatial-counterspatial ‘struggle’ in the inter-atomic volume forces neutrons to radiate.

In ultimate reduction, even the discharging plane of the correct atomic model is merely a stepped and conjugated
discharge as
mediated by and thru the magneto-dielectric inter-atomic geometry. In which case all atomic models are accurately the
tripartite
interplay between the charged mass particles, either neutron or proton (dielectric or magnetic in dominance) and their
encapsulating
magneto-dielectric volumes which mediate spatial and counterspatial charges and discharges as well as form the charging
boundaries
of all atoms to form molecules and all other compounds.

The “strong interaction” or “strong nuclear force” is merely the immense counterspatial bounding power of dielectricity
which binds
protons and neutrons into and as a stable mass particles, and the same forces between protons and neutrons which hold
them together
in the nucleus. Convoluted explanations of GR and QM are fantastical and irrational.

bonding daily to explain molecular bonding.**

**Atomic orbitals geometry as logically explained by magneto-dielectric inter-atomic volume**

_Maxwell’s discovery of a factor of proportionality between dielectricity and magnetism led to his theory of conjugate
pair of
inductions, dielectric and magnetic, in union, propagating at the velocity of light through the “Luminiferous Aether”.
Hence, electro-
magnetic waves in free space, unbounded by gross physical matter, mass free energy. This propagation is within the
dielectric, or
aetheric, medium itself. It is free of so-called “charge carriers” (electrons), a mass-less form of electricity. This
concept had a very
powerful impact upon the scientific and philosophical thoughts of Maxwell’s era. So here begins the notion of
“wireless”, the
transmission of electricity without wires or other guiding structures. Leading up to the work of Heinrich Hertz, 1857 to
1894, the
wireless transmission of electricity had found experimental verification by Joseph Henry, and Elihu Thompson. It even
was patented
by M. Loomis. These examples however were not electro-magnetic, they were electro-static (dielectric). Heinrich Hertz
provided the
first complete laboratory demonstration of the transmission of electricity through “free space”, (across the room). This
was instantly
considered proof of the Maxwell theory of electro-magnetism, and electro-magnetic waves. When Nikola Tesla engaged in
the
experiments of Hertz, he found these waves not to be completely electromagnetic. The early death of Hertz prevented any
further
progress. However “the world view” kept hold of its belief that “Hertzian” waves are only transverse E. M. waves, the
two
distinctions now synonymous._ **– Eric P. Dollard**

Since we know electrons are not particles, but a misunderstanding of magneto-dielectric fields in motion, we can examine
atomic
orbital geometry with perfect lucid clarity. Chemists use the balloon model of the atom everyday to explain covalent
bonding in the
formation of molecules, which is exactly correct! However what is not understood is that these dumbbell and disk
configurations are

magnetic (dumbbell formations) and dielectric (disk areas of inertial planes) dominances (moving counter to each other)
as driven by
the gravitational (strong nuclear force comprising stable dielectric wave bundles of inertia), protons (magnetically
charged) and
neutrons (dielectrically dominant).
Using what we have proven about magnetism moving spatially away from dielectricity in hyperbolas (inverse sphere), and
dielectricity being a centripetal radial counterspatial inertial plane, all atomic orbitals can be understood with
demonstrable lucid
understanding even to a young person.

**Below: On the left we have different planes of the magnetic and dielectric, middle magnetic dominances from proton
movement production of magnetism, and right typical explanations of chemical ionic bonding from attractively charged
particles which meet at electro-geometric point of low pressure.**

**Below: On the left we have complex magnetic meeting points with corresponding dielectric repulsion saddles, middle we
have
left-side archaic incorrect model of the atom and right-side the correct way atoms are treated daily by chemistry to
show the
basis of covalent bonding, however these orbitals are not electron ‘clouds’ or other nonsense, but protonic magnetic
dominances interwoven between dielectric inertial planes which creates a conjugate pair of forces which is the correct
atomic
model, explains charge, discharge, and bonding in molecules. On the far right we have a pair of proton-sourced magnetic
spatial dominances between which exists but is not illustrated, dielectric planes.**

**Below: On the left, more magnetic configurations, at bottom right of same you can see the dielectric inertial plane,
same as a
found in a conventional “magnet”. On the right illustration you can see some of the complex magneto-dielectric
geometries
atoms can take depending on charge, temperature, nucleal orientations etc.**

**Below: On the left and right you can see that molecules come together at lowest pressure and charge points, either
dielectrically or magnetically and in complex, always both. Understanding this divinely simplex fact explains atomic
architecture, covalent bonding as used by chemists every day, and utterly debunks the notion of a swarming nest of “0
rest-
mass” so-called “electrons” which cannot in any way, explain the atomic and molecular bonding of atoms. The very premise
that the atom (as espoused by GR and QM) is “99.999999999% empty space, nothing” is an outright insane absurdity. If one
wishes to call dielectricity and magnetism not-a-thing (‘nothing’) so be it, however there is “air” in the atomic
‘balloon’, and
that air is a conjugate pair of dielectric and magnetic fields generated by the nucleal dynamos generating and changing
them
at every millisecond and faster.**

**Atomic orbitals: Lets look at the nonsense from GR and QM in black, and correct it in the blue**

It was found that the orbiting electrons around a nucleus could not be fully described as particles, but needed to be
explained by the
wave-particle duality. In this sense, the electrons have the following properties:
(What this really means is that enormous evidence against the electron-bead model of the atom forced another quantum
“Alice in
Wonderland” answer from the cult of quantum to explain atomic geometry, this time as “wave particle duality” absurdity.)
**Wave-like properties:**

1. The electrons do not orbit the nucleus in the sense of a planet orbiting the sun, but instead exist as standing
   waves. The lowest
   possible energy an electron can take is therefore analogous to the fundamental frequency of a wave on a string.
   Higher energy states
   are then similar to harmonics of the fundamental frequency.
   (What this really means is that the so-called ‘electron’ is a magneto-dielectric field whose wave/undulatory
   mechanics are dependent
   upon the nucleal makeup)


2. The electrons are never in a single point location, although the probability of interacting with the electron at a
   single point can be
   found from the wave function of the electron.
   (What this really means is there is no such thing as an electron outright, it has no point, no locus, therefore
   cannot be a particle, and
   yet the magnetic and dielectric interactions can be explained by wave functions.)
   **Particle-like properties:**
1. There is always an integer number of electrons orbiting the nucleus.
   (This is purely conjecture and speculation)
2. Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons,
   only a single
   electron changes states in response to the photon.
   (This is purely conjecture and speculation, what this means is if another dielectric outside charge strikes the atom
   its charge state
   geometry changes in response to the change in charge, creating an imbalance in the inter-atomic magneto-dielectric
   volume)
3. The electrons retain particle like-properties such as: each wave state has the same electrical charge as the electron
   particle. Each
   wave state has a single discrete spin (spin up or spin down).
   (This is nonsense, even under the heading of particles, they cannot escape the fact that the so-called electron has
   no particle-nature, no
   reality as such)
   Thus, despite the obvious analogy to planets revolving around the Sun, electrons cannot be described simply as solid
   particles.
   (Here there is agreement, electrons do not exist, and they’re an abstraction of the functions of discharging boundary
   ‘points’
   incorrectly deemed “discharge particles”)
   In addition, atomic orbitals do not closely resemble a planet's elliptical path in ordinary atoms. A more accurate
   analogy might be that
   of a large and often oddly shaped "atmosphere" (the electron)
   (Here there is agreement again! The discharging field, which they are calling an ‘atmosphere’ is merely a function of
   spatial charge
   transferences)
   distributed around a relatively tiny planet (the atomic nucleus). Atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of
   this "atmosphere" only
   when a single electron is present in an atom.
   (Meaning there is no hope of this particle nonsense being explained for most atoms which contain, as they postulate
   “enormous
   numbers of electrons”, such as lead, plutonium, etc. Once again they use the term “atmosphere” to describe a field,
   magnetic and
   dielectric. This “cloud” model of the atom is not fundamentally different than the solar model of the atom. Purely
   absurd and illogical)
   When more electrons are added to a single atom, the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in a volume of
   space around the
   nucleus so that the resulting collection (sometimes termed the atom’s “electron cloud”) tends toward a generally
   spherical zone of
   probability describing where the atom’s electrons will be found.
   (This is purely conjecture and speculation of the highest order)
   Fundamentally, an atomic orbital is a one-electron wave function, even though most electrons do not exist in
   one-electron atoms, and
   so the one-electron view is an approximation
   (Meaning the only nonsense that can be diagramed is the hydrogen atom, not the 99% of the rest of the elements.)
   The vibrations of an electron, is an idealized circular drum head—essentially an elastic membrane of uniform
   thickness attached to a
   rigid circular frame.
   (Meaning dielectric inertial plane torque, of the dielectric field in the interatomic. Now they explain
   charge-discharge or a supposed
   particle with that of a drum head. There are no discreet particles in the universe, all is mediated by fields,
   charges, discharges, and
   centripetal-centrifugal movements in the spatial magnetic, and counterspatial dielectric cosmos).

**Galactic jets as magnetic and electrified magneto-dielectric models**

_“The very small is mirrored in the very large in nature, this is always the case”_ **_– ancient saying_**

_“Experiment without theory is tinkering. Theory without experiment is mysticism, is quantum nonsense.”_ **_– Author_**

_“The great mystery, now understood, is that while magnetism and dielectricity move 180 degrees from each other, in
binding closed
systems where gravity is immense, either in galactic structures, or in nuclear structures, the disk-dumbbell formations
of dielectricity
and magnetism move (only apparently) 90 degrees from each other in the special geometric formations of a disk and a pair
of inverse
double hyperbolas, since the structure is of course binding and contractive, this is the lowest pressure model of
magneto-dielectric
mutual repulsion. How do two opposite forces that are “tied” together in a system (inter-atomic, galactic, permanent
magnet) move
180 degrees from each other when one is spatial and polarized, and the other is radial and counterspatial, the answer is
an inertial
plane accretion disk and a double hyperbola. What appears as perpendicular movement is in fact maximum repulsion in a
binding
system.”_ **_– Author_**

_“Science wrongly thinks that since iron is endothermic, that this is why a supernova occurs, because stars cannot burn
iron, and once
iron is produced, the star tears itself apart, of which the later part is true. However as we know iron is the most
stable element, iron is
supra-dielectric, it is capable of enormous amounts of electrical saturation (which is needed to create a magnet), and
capable of
enormous amounts of magnetic induction, or saturation. Literally an ‘electrical sponge’. We wrongly think copper and
silver are the
‘electrical sponges’ since they’re used in power feed lines, when in fact, of course, they are dielectric reflectors as
Heaviside,
Maxwell, Steinmetz, and Tesla declared them. We have it backwards.”_ **_- Author_**

Importantly I must state that discovering the identical bell-disk, or double-hyperbola-disk nature of galactic jets came
after the fact
of discovery of same from experimentation with magnetism, I did not model magnetism upon the this galactic
architectures. Pure
discovery and insight into recognizing this special spatial-hyperbola conjugate relationship as seen in galactic
formations came later,
and proved the timeless adage that “in the very small you can see the very big, and vice-versa”.
Imagine a “magnet” (a dielectric object with resultant magnetic spatial Z-axis phenomena), except a trillion trillion
times larger and
equally more powerful. As predicted by myself and circumstantially so by a few others, such a perfect-point intersection
is the
creation of matter itself, wrongly called a black hole, and completely refuted by Stephen J Crothers. The dielectric
accretion disk is
creating new matter that is flowing centrifugally outwards along the hyperbolic conical vortex of the galactic jets.
Gravito-magnetism
as conceived of by the fool Einstein does not exist, however the effect is real and is driven by a dielectro-gravimetric
field which is –
TIME and –SPACE (counterspatial). This is specifically a dielectric inertial effect of spinning electrical giant masses
which generate
enormous dielectric inertial planes and axially form matter generation.
Galactic jets are extremely powerful jets of charged matter and gas, or plasma which emerges from presumed massive
objects at
the centers of some active galaxies, notably radio galaxies and quasars. Their lengths can reach several thousand or
even hundreds of
thousands of light years, literally many trillions of miles in very tight magnetic vortex formations; quite literally a
multi-trillion mile
needle of newly generated matter and plasma. The reality is that the magnetic fields in the accretion disk collimates
the outflow along
the rotation axis of the central point where the dielectric and magnetic forces are strongest and, of course,
self-repulsing, so that when
conditions are suitable, a jet will emerge from each face of the accretion disk. If the jet is oriented along the line
of sight to Earth,
relativistic beaming will change its apparent brightness. The mechanics behind both the creation of the jets and the
composition of the
jets is perfectly understood upon knowing the conjugate relationship, the geometry, and model of magneto-dielectricity.
How they
move, reciprocate, and how one affects the other. Logically so, studies of these galactic jets, or the birthing of
matter itself from
intense magneto-dielectric forces, have recently proved the obvious, that these jets contain matter.
In ignorance it has been stated that: “Ever since the first observations of these powerful jets, which are among the
brightest objects
seen in the universe, astronomers have wondered what causes the particles to accelerate to such great speeds.”.
Obviously so these
multi-trillion mile magnetic jets are the necessitated repulsion from the accretion disk which is electrical in nature,
specifically natures
natural electricity, dielectricity. The distorted galactic jets do not form typical permanent magnet reciprocating
spheres because the
accretion disk is so utterly massive and powerful, however the golden ratio symmetry is still preserved. The distorted
magnetic field
lines pull charged particles off the disk and cause them to gush outward at nearly the speed of light.
The intersection points between the dielectric and the magnetic creates a special spherical volume where no induction
can occur, no
light can propagate, there is no medium to “soak into”, this rare geometry is a special counterspace where the Ether has
been
completely displaced. The fools of GR and QM call this a “black hole”, but its definition and parameter all fail and
have been
disproved already in full. This special geometry, unlike normal Ether-counterspace, is utterly devoid of medium and
field induction or
propagation, electricity and light can enter where no reaction can occur. This special counterspace geometry is found at
the center of
every “magnet” but of insufficient power for anything of the immense magnitudes of galactic magneto-dielectric
intersections where
matter is generated and expelled, in the jets of plasma.
This special geometry is the one and only true ‘void’, since Ether itself has been displaced, and ironically is the very
same locus of
new matter generation at the immediate apex point of super-powerful magnetic centrifugal vortexes along the
circumferential points of
the sphere where the dielectric and magnetic meet and (very hard to visualize but extremely simple) the magnetic field
forces the
super powerful dielectric charges to form new ionized elements, hydrogen and possibly helium as well. Quite literally a
galactic
‘navel’ where the birth of new matter occurs. How archetypal of the ancient mythos which said the very same thing; how
extremely
prophetic, ironic, and amazingly accurate.

**Below: Other than the inaccurate depictions of a black hole (a non-existent object disproven by Crothers and others)
at the
center of the inertial plane and magnetic apex centrifugal jets, these depictions are accurate, both to the model of
magnetism
in a permanent magnet and to the dielectric inertial plane. However given the immense power of these systems, the Ether
which is compressible, the magnetic jets are likewise compressed in geometry, however still at golden ratio
polarization.**

**Below: Supernova 1987a, with magnetic bells, and dielectric “lynchpin” disk at the center. Obviously dominantly
magnetic,
because at the end of life, stars have created so much iron, they cannot ‘burn’ iron. Iron means magnetism, magnetism
means
spatial displacement, meaning supernova. Iron is the boundary element where fusion ends and radiation, or explosion
begins.
Even all scientists agree on this point. Its not that iron kills stars, which it does, but rather the magnetic
saturation attributes
of iron tear apart a star like a central explosion from magnetic spatially radiative dilation. Stars are electrical, are
centripetal
in their field, until they produce iron, at which time, they explode, like magnetism which is a radiative termination,
and
become centrifugally-initiated (due to iron production) stellar ‘bombs’ which tear themselves apart.**

**Light’s missing secret, or, electromagnetism is not purely (or mostly) electromagnetic at all**

The very principle of the ‘photon’, same as the ‘electron’ is pure rubbish. The false reification of light as
“self-inductive” E and M
components cannot exist, and is not the nature of light or electromagnetism in general. The co-axial nature of light at
which EM
conjugates thru the dielectric carrier is the correct geometry of ‘electromagnetism’.

The incorrect notion from the cult of Quantum is that: “photons of a light beam have a characteristic energy
proportional to the
frequency of the light”. The truth of the matter however is that the radial ‘internal’ component of dielectric energy as
comprising the
correct model and geometry of light is proportional to the high frequency, or shorter wavelength of the EM.

The nonsense of the “wave packet” and the photon is the misunderstanding of the dielectric energy carried proportional
to the
frequency of the bounding electromagnetic with its internal and co-axial radial charge-carrying conductor, the
dielectric. The electric
and magnetic components are merely byproducts of the dielectro-electromagnetic geometry incorrectly thought of as (
merely)
electromagnetic in nature.

**BELOW: On the left are the incorrect conventional misunderstandings of TEM. Center the circular polarization along the
Z-
axis of the radial dielectric. Right is the coaxial cable as invented by O. Heaviside who understood the coaxial nature
of EM
propagation, but apparently didn’t understand that there was a third component to TEM.**

That light has 2 modes of reciprocation and three components is specifically the basis of the “wave-particle duality” (
in reality an
electromagnetic and dielectric radial-dimensional co-axial geometry) as wrongly propounded by GR and Quantum. Two
transverse E
and M polarizations with dimensionality and a dielectric radial component, which is the electromagnetic-fulcrum upon
which
electricity and magnetism conjugate thru and against.

The nonsense of “wave-particle duality” from Quantum mysticism is a fallacy; light creates interference fringes due to
constructive or
destructive phasing from the dielectric additive or destructive polarization, or “light on light”.

While magnetism is geometric and spatial, electricity and dielectricity are counterspatial (however the electrical
component is
polarized). The quasi-matter of E.M. has the dielectric as the counterspatial Z-axis or ray around which electricity and
magnetism
reciprocate thru mutual induction and capacitance upon and rebounding against the dielectric. There are no photons, this
inducto-
capacitant electro-magnetic form, or E.M. accounts for the misunderstanding of wave-particle ‘duality’ (rather sheer
ignorance) and
countless other unique attributes of T.E.M.

**BELOW: The correct geometry of TEM, dielectro-electromagnetism with its Z-axis radial component. Discovery 4-2014**

Light is not a material emanation or projection, rather sheer induction containing 2 axial and 1 radial components. By
true definition,
the very nature of all electromagnetism is a wheel, as is the co-axial geometry of same. Spatial electrical and magnetic
components,
induce each other THRU, as is necessitated, the counterspatial dielectric center axial and radial point. Linear and
circular polarization
alike.

Magnetic lines of induction cannot terminate in space nor can dielectric ones. The radial axle of the geometry of light
is absolutely
necessitated, it cannot exist in any other way, and certainly not the “self-conjugating and self-capacitance”
conceptions as currently
exist about electromagnetism. The claim that EM is “self-conjugating and inducing self-capacitance” is to claim your car
engine
pistons are reciprocating upon nothing, no crankshaft of mutual inductive rebounding reciprocation. This is both
illogical and
impossible. Countless phenomena, including the so-called “photo-electric” (really the radial-dielectric) effect proves
this to be the
case. As mentioned before, electricity can only induce or terminate into or as magnetism thru dielectricity.

**BELOW: Left, high power low loss ‘air coaxial’ cable employing an outer EM reflector/ shield, and the center radial
dielectric
pipe which guides the dielectric down the pipe. Middle picture is circular polarization. Right are the three components
of
TEM.**

There is more than ample proof that Oliver Heaviside knew the geometry of EM, however he does not outright declare same,
but in
his writings “a perfect conductor is a perfect obstructer” there is much indication, and the pinnacle to all of this is
the fact that
Heaviside invented the very coaxial cable itself.

Light does not bend around supermassive objects such as has been observed around our sun, rather the accumulative field
of both
gravity and dielectricity as the hub of all electromagnetism and light are centripetally attractive just as are the
inverse spins of any
polarized magnetic field.

Dielectric susceptibility thru a dielectric medium is the proportionality to the frequency as necessitated by
permetivity of the
electromagnetic geometry upon the dielectric ‘conductor’ at the Z-axis to refraction.

Dielectro-electromagnetism behaves like both matter “particles” and as waves because the Z-axis of the dielectric radial
component
and its co-axial nature produce said results, with likewise additive and negating bands due to the electromagnetic
component.

The absurd belief that electromagnetic waves as ‘self propagating’ and ‘self-inductive’ transverse waves with electric
and magnetic
fields oscillating at right angles to the direction of propagation is a product of quantum mysticism and has no basis in
reality. The Z-
axis of electromagnetic propagation is the dielectric, the bounding inertial counterspatial barrier which induces and
reciprocates both
the electric and magnetic in wavelength and amplitude.

**BELOW: Left, circular and linear propagation, likewise on the picture at right.**

Just as sound requires a medium of propagation, likewise so too does electromagnetism. The photon of quantum mysticism
is purely
an abstraction in speaking of the dielectric rays of pure inductance which lay at the Z-axis of EM radiation. The medium
of EM is the
Ether-dielectric plane of centripetal inertia, which reciprocates E and M spirally along its axis at sourced wavelengths
and amplitudes.

A ray of dielectric induction is the bounding plane at which electromagnetism transversely conjugate along what was
incorrectly
thought to be an ‘imaginary axis’, which is an empirical and logical impossibility.

The dielectric field of induction, Psi, in Coulombs, produces an electro-static potential, **e** , in Volts. Conversely
an electro-static
potential, **e** , in Volts, produces the dielectric field, Psi, in Coulomb which reciprocally produces to the magnetic,
or Phi.
Dielectric and magnetic proportionality along with their conjugating electrical component comprise the electromagnetic
propagating
spatio-electric boundary of the dielectric radial momentum as defined in the electromagnetic structure.

**BELOW: This chart really is that simple. Mass/atoms are dielectric condensates created by enormous power (see galactic
jets
above) and other stellar formations. Light on the other regard, has a Z-axis dielectric radial component. For lack of
better
terminology, the incorrect insanity of Quantum-atomism’s “wave particle” duality is that light is a quasi-matter
phenomena.
Extreme powers applied to the dielectric hyperboloid causes inertial plane torque and creates the fundamental particle
all
matter and atoms are based upon. Literally, light and matter are two modalities of dielectric condensates, one is
‘stable’, the
other is carried along by its directing transverse electric and magnetic constituents. Amusingly, since both matter and
light are
Ether field modality expressions of dielectricity, one could (humorously) call light dielectricity-lite, and matter
dielectricity-
heavy. Both light and matter are merely field modalities that have conformed to the conditions of their formation.
Creating
light is rather easy, as must be logically so; creating the fundamental particle matter, however, takes enormous power.
**

The product of a single line of dielectric induction with a line of magnetic induction gives birth to a unit of
electrification, Q. The idea
of a photon, or ‘quantum unit’ of electromagnetic induction is incorrect. The EM capacitance is purely along the Z-axis
of the ray-
dielectric at the center of reciprocating EM thru the dielectric counterspatial plane in the genuine model of EM
propagation.

The four dimensions of electrical engineering, time, space, dielectricity, magnetism comprise the 5-part (in time and
wavelength/amplitude) model of electromagnetism thru a vacuum as must be necessitated. This is also a defining aspect of
EM being
‘quasi-matter’, which is merely a misnomer as to the co-axial nature of EM and the dielectric geometry of all
electromagnetism.

**BELOW: The missing secret of light is now, for the first time ever, rationally exposed, deconstructed, and unites
every
phenomena known to exist around and regarding light. This explains the supposed “wave particle duality”, it explains the
Faraday effect, it explains the photo-electric effect, explains the manner by which light can be twisted by magnetic
fields,
explains why light can be deflected by extremely strong centripetal gravitational fields. The idiot Einstein said:** *
*_“We are faced
with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately (particle and wave theory)
neither of them
fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do.”_** **The ‘photon’ is a purely arbitrary concept. Einstein
wrongly
concluded light was a discrete wave-packet. He called such a wave-packet a ‘light quanta’. Light, in fact, is D.E.M (
dielectro-
electromagnetic), a tri-fold circuit. The fundamental mass particle itself being a dielectric accretion formed in
galactic
formations, it is no coincidence whatsoever that light, like an atom itself, has dualistic properties of both waves and
a beam of
elements.**

Dielectricity is a radial force, magnetism is a circumferential force, electricity is a spherical centripetal force,
likewise the Ether itself
is the omnipresent ‘point-force’ of which magnitude cannot and does not apply. All forces are vortex in nature.

Light through a dielectric medium is the square root of the inverse of the change of capacitance as mediated thru the
dielectric medium
of propagation. Therefore capacitance is a directional relationship with the luminal velocity of light in any medium of
propagation. If
there is 0 capacitance there is, of course, infinite speed.

The product of the magnetic permeability, Mu, and the dielectric permittivity, Epsilon, is 1/Csquared. This forms the
basis of
electromagnetic wave propagation thru the Ether, this transverse dielectro-electromagnetism bounded coaxial formation.
The product
Mu – Epsilon is the metrical relation of the Ether, which is the carrier of light.

The coaxial cable is known as the "Electromagnetic Boundary Condition" and it facilitates the existence of a guided
electromagnetic
wave. The metallic structures establishes the electric circuit, but it does not directly convey the electromagnetism.
This metallic
structure is wrongly called the "electric conductor," but its actual function is to define a pair of closed loops and
the radial dielectric
conductor thru with E and M reciprocate and conjugate thru. These loops serves to confine, or "bottle," the
electromagnetic energy in
the dielectric space enclosed by the system of conductors.

**BELOW: The “drop” analogy of light and the “electromagnetic spectrum”. Radial light energy transference begins with
the
dielectric pulse, which in discharge creates a magnetic pulse, in combination both the dielectric and magnetic produce
the
electric component of light; this trifecta is instantaneous. This is the trifold circuit is the missing secret of light
so horribly
perverted by quantum with insane rationalizations and absurd conclusions. The ‘photon’ was created as a purely arbitrary
concept to explain the seemingly dual quasi-matter nature of light, which exhibits both particle and wave-like
attributes.
However this is easily explained by the D.E.M (dielectro-electromagnetic) circuit in a single pulse of light.**

**BELOW: The ‘drop’ analogy on left, in which, proportional to wavelength, there are dielectric radial pulses which
maintain
the structure of light. Magnetic deflection of light can only exist if the significant carrier is a radial dielectric,
just like a coaxial
cable. On the right, the current understanding of light is purely a misunderstanding.**

**BELOW: All manner of light phenomena can be explained by the D.E.M (dielectro-electromagnetic) circuit theory of
light.**

Dielectro-electromagnetism in the higher dielectric-energetic end of the spectrum (Xray, gamma) have more energy due to
the
proportional dielectric capacitance relational to the frequency of the bounding EM structure at emission.

Electromagnetism does not travel thru space, rather conjugates and reciprocates along the dielectric Z-axis which is the
radial
conductor, the energy carrier, and the genuine “ray” of light. Like pistons, electromagnetic bounding structures keep
the dielectric
radial in check as the actual “electromagnetic” point-line of propagation. The electrical and magnetic components induce
each other
thru the dielectric, from field to field, in endless reciprocating actions.

**BELOW: Left, single component of dielectro-electromagnetic geometry. Right showing how shorter wavelengths equal
higher
kinetic energy. Shorter wavelengths also have spatially smaller EM reciprocation, meaning higher dielectric energy
capacitance.**

There are two ways to deliver identical amounts kinetic energy in TEM of dielectric radiation to a target, a large
volume of coherent
radiation as in a laser, or a small volume of incoherent radiation of a short wavelength (gamma, X-ray) comprising a
center-axial with
an extremely high kinetic radial energy capacitance.

**BELOW: Exactly like a power drill, the more revolutions per second, or in the case of light, the shorter the
wavelength, the
more power is brought to bear in the coaxial system. Drill bit, or light, same analogy, increase in power, increase in
revolutions
(= shorter wavelength). Draw more power to the drill to increase physical power to the bit to drill thru tougher more
dense
materials is the same with “electromagnetism”, which is why X-rays, gamma rays etc. ‘drill’ right thru dense matter,
transfer
power and can cause immense damage. The magnetic component of traditional “electromagnetic” geometry cannot affect
damage or power at shorter wavelengths, nor can its reciprocating transverse electrical component; only the coherent
dielectric radial component can. The nonsense of “wave-particle duality” is dismissed and replaced with logic and
rationality
in the true model of dielectro-electromagnetic phenomena. In the diagram below you will need to see this along all 3
axes, Z-
axis dielectric, X-axis electrical, and Y-axis magnetic. For illustration purposes the X and Y are laid flat in 2D for
illustration
purposes, otherwise the Y-axis magnetic would overlay the Z-axis and make the diagram unclear.**

The dielectric charge pulses like a heart depending on wavelength which is proportional to eV power. Pulses change with
phase shift
and circular or linear polarization, but the continuity is still kept.

Electromagnetic dielectric capacitance is a direct relationship with the velocity of EM in ANY GIVEN MEDIUM. If the
medium has
0 capacitance potential, then there is infinite velocity, or a “zero-time-transmission”.

The electromagnetic geometry can only saturate into the medium at the rate at which is defined by said medium. As such
light or, EM,
can only travel at luminal velocities as constrained by the dielectric medium’s capacitance and its spatial relation of
1/Csquared.
Electromagnetism is not a phenomenal or particle projection, this is impossible. It is a pure inductive process of the
dielectric core, or
nature of all electromagnetic radiation.

Magnetism circumferential and dielectric is only radial however its 3D nature of self-termination is a toroid.
Dielectricity forms
toroidal closed loops (doughnut shape) in movement as it is induced (pulsed) in the electromagnetic reciprocation of
electromagnetism. The perpendicular transverse electrical component as induced by the reciprocating magnetism thru the
radial
dielectric center ‘conductor’ causes, either linear or circular (or otherwise) polarization of electrification to
manifest at which type the
cycle reverses in reciprocation. Again, electromagnetism is NOT electromagnetic in nature, but an electrical and
magnetic transverse
reciprocation thru the radial counterspatial dielectric carrier, to which Quantum, in ignorance, has deemed a “photon”.

**Below: A torus of light as seen between a ferrocell in which two magnets are undergoing dielectric spatial voidance.
Comprehension of why there is a shrinking sphere of light rather than a radial collapse is of utmost importance.
Likewise can
be seen with iron filings. Spatial divergence must be necessarily voided by means of a sphere rather than sheer radial
voidance. See the section on the hyperboloid.**

The dielectro-electromagnetic nature of “electromagnetism” is a transverse conjugating and reciprocating co-axial binary
vortex of
spatial and counterspatial radial emanations which is the most stable and, of course, natures way of matter-free energy
transmission.
This magneto-electric-dielectric geometry is the only possible, the only logical model, and is necessitated by countless
known
phenomena, therefore the only accurate depiction of electromagnetism. It cannot exist any other way.

As is the nature of dielectricity, the smaller the space, the MORE dielectricity that can be stored, this is why the
frequency of an
“electromagnetic” bounding geometry is directly proportional to its dielectric capacitance. This is evidenced in the
dielectro-
electromagnetic effect (wrongly conceived of as the photoelectric effect) where frequency is proportional to the energy
propagated.

**Below: The so-called “pseudo-sphere” in chain (as per light) of dielectric inertia as seen in the example of
dielectro-
electromagnetism. Proportional to the wavelength of the light, there are more or less dielectric pulses and likewise
proportional increasing or decreasing kinetic energy from the Z-axis radial dielectric component of light resultant from
its
wavelength. The smaller the space, the higher the dielectric capacitance. Below is a shorter wavelength, and likewise
more
pulses and energy in transference. This is irrefutable.**

The quadrature of the dielectro-electromagnetic geometry is a union of magnetic induction and dielectric induction,
which induce the
transverse electrical element perpendicular to the radial Z-axis of dielectric propagation. This quadrature of
reciprocating induction
and three components is nature’s method of radial mass-free energy propagation.

The propagation of dielectric energy in the “electromagnetic” form is within the bounding transverse “space” of these E
and M
‘conductors’. This space is the radial and co-axial centerpoint of “electromagnetic” propagation.

The stable nature of dielectro-electromagnetism, or “electromagnetism” over countless light years is due to the
extremely interesting
geometry of dielectro-electromagnetic (or “EM”) radiation. As a permanent magnet conjugates outwardly centrifugally and
returns
(CCW to CW or CW to CCW) centripetally along the lowest pressure gradients, so too does dielectro-electromagnetism
conjugate its
electrical and magnetic components in pressure gradients in the form of an accretion disk along a radial dielectric
element. Whereas a
magnet has, inversely but proportionally, at the “Bloch wall” an inertial plane, or accretion disk of centripetal
dielectricity, dielectro-
electromagnetism has an accretion disk of electrical and magnetic components that conjugate centrifugally and
centripetally along the
radial dielectric Z-axis.

Magnetism has a center-point dielectric accretion (flattened toroid) disk at which the magnetism conjugates in an
inverse sphere
(double hyperbola, hourglass geometry) centrifugally-peripherally and centripetally centered along the lowest pressure
points. In
likewise but ‘opposite’ fashion, dielectro-electromagnetism is the counterspatial-axial and radial-spatial (EM)
centerpoint (inverse to a
magnet) at which electromagnetic components reciprocate as a spatial accretion disk which is, as necessitated, vortex in
geometry.

**The Photoelectric effect lie corrected, the dielectric discharge effect**

The erroneous Einstein mental failure as currently thought of as a “wave packet” is in fact a dielectric pulse in the
radial center of EM
propagation. This pulse is proportional to the frequency, the intensity of the EM being emitted as the Z-axis
radial-dielectric (wrongly
called photo-electric) charges indicate from experimentation. The Quantum notion of a “wave packet” and the ‘photon’ do
not exist in
the electromagnetic-dielectric model of the EM spectrum. They are phantom misunderstandings of electrodynamics,
dielectric
capacitance and reciprocating mutual conjugation by and thru magneto-spatial and dielectric-counterspatial co-axial
energy
formations.

The test and results of the photoelectric experiment are, of course, completely accurate and valid, the **explanation
however** (where
myopic pseudo-science fails typically) is a pure insane fantasy, both illogical, irrational, absurd, and purely the
insane conclusion of
Einstein’s idiocy and his atomistic proclivities. **Einstein had absolute NO training or study in electrical theory**
ala Tesla, Faraday,
Maxwell and others. His only acclaim, his Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect (not its results, but its
explanation!) is a complete
lie, fabrication and utter farce in the extreme.

**Insanity defined in pure rarified form:** “Photons have no mass, but they have momentum and they have an energy”. A
massless
mass/particle is an absurd premise in the extreme, in defining the so-called photon, which in reality is a radial
dielectric Z-axis

component of the so-called “electromagnetism”. It has inertia (not momentum, which is applicable to mass/matter), it of
course has
energy and is the only component of light that is the source for the energy of both its discharge as magnetism, and its
magneto-
dielectric mirror in transverse composition as electricity in the dielectro-electromagnetic true nature of light. This
applies to the entire
‘electromagnetic’ spectrum. Light itself (as this work expands in form and editions) cannot exist without a Z-axis
radial dielectric
component, absolutely no different than the coaxial cable.

**Below: The lie of the “photoelectric effect” showing non-existent electrons being shot off the reflector. Replace E
with energy
of the dielectric, h Planck and f frequency remain the same. This diagram is a lie fundamentally since the charged
induction
from the dielectric resides as capacitance between two charging plates, there is NOTHING (as the wrongly implied
‘discharge
particle’) shot off the surface material, and certainly no electrons.**

Dielectricity has the attributes of a refractive index depending on the field or material encountered (dielectric,
diamagnetic, ferrous,
etc.), dielectric inductivity and a luminal velocity when bounded by a co-axial electromagnetic geometry. This
dielectric nature
explains photoelectrical effects, refraction, dispersion, wave-particle dualities, diffusion, slow down in a dielectric
medium,
polarization phenomena, and high frequency power in electromagnetics.
In the magneto-electric-dielectric geometry of “electromagnetism”, all magnetic lines are closed in upon themselves and
likewise
induce the dielectric conductor to electrification. Likewise the dielectric lines of force are counterspatially self
terminating in radiating
thru space and are the ‘crankshaft’ for electrical and magnetic reciprocation and inductance, which cannot, may not, as
is commonly
believed “self induce” each other.

**Below: What is really occurring is the shorter wavelength TEM is striking a plate in a vacuum tube and causing
induction
differential between the cathode and anode. This is an electromotive force, not ‘electrons’ (non-existent fabrications)
moving
between the charged and discharge plate.**

The so-called “photoelectric effect” explains why the energy of the charging dielectric was dependent only on the
frequency of the
incident light and not on its intensity: a low-intensity, high-frequency source could supply a few high energy
dielectric pulsations,
whereas a high-intensity, low-frequency source would supply no radial dielectric pulsations of sufficient energy to
cause charge upon
the striking surface.

Einstein’s unintelligent conclusions were that this wrongly conceived “photoelectric effect” contradicted the wave
theory of light that
followed by J.C. Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetic behavior, however the truth of course is that this observed
effect is the
resultant of charging from dielectric inductance from the radial center-co-axial nature of high-energy and frequency
light which is
dielectro-electromagnetic. Contrary to belief, they did not contradict Maxwell's equations in the observed results,
rather proved the
central axial conductor of electromagnetism, the dielectric, however wrongly interpreted and understood by the lesser
mind of
Einstein.

**Below: The shorter the wavelength, high frequency D.E.M (dielectro-electromagnetic) light, the more dielectric pulses,
the
more power, the higher the energy.**

The prediction that the energy in charge created in this effect increases radially with the frequency of the light was
accurate, its
interpretation however was wholly inaccurate.

**Below: On the left is a cylinder magnet above a ferrocell in which the light is being displaced by the centrifugal
magnetism
and directed along the dielectric inertial plane of the magnet in perfect expected field mediation as explained much
earlier as
per the F.I. of how mutually repulsing inertial dielectric and divergent centrifugal magnetic radiation mediate out
pressure
gradients in the binding system of the ‘magnet’. On the right is the accurate illustration of the field mediation in any
and all
‘magnets’ and likewise the light which is deflected from the divergent magnetism and concentrated at, focused at the
dielectric
inertial plane. Photo courtesy T. Vanderelli.**

The wrongly conceived photoelectric effect helped to propel the then-emerging quantum mysticism forward in a radical
fashion. Light
simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles, each being manifested according to the
circumstances,
however horribly misunderstood by Einstein and his henchmen, and likewise their blind followers.

The effect was impossible to be understood in terms of the classical wave descriptions of light obviously,^ since the
energy of the
charge did not depend on the intensity of the incidental EM radiation.

**Refraction and dispersion of light thru a medium**

The refraction of light thru a medium depends upon the wavelength and is proportional to the dielectric capacitance of
the medium of
propagation.

Dielectric susceptibility thru a dielectric medium is proportional to the high frequency low wavelengths, due to the
permetivity of the
bounding electromagnetism upon the dielectric Z-axis to refraction.

The reason energetic blue light is diffracted more is due to the motional breaking thru the dielectric medium by the
bounding EM
which deflects the blue wavelength higher-dielectric-energetic frequencies much more so than the less energetic red.

Literally the higher power shorter wavelengths have FAR greater dielectric capacitance. More dielectric pulses and
energy over a
given length than, for instance infrared, and the tighter the bounding structure, the more dielectricity. This is the
fundamental
electrical-geometry of counterspacial capacitance, or dielectricity. This and this alone is the missing secret of light,
the coaxial radiant
geometry of light for the very fist time ever discovered here, in this paper. The mystery of shorter wavelengths = more
power = more
energy is over. Simplicity in divinity. Lights coaxial Z-axis radial dielectric geometry is now laid bare in its glaring
simplicity.

Shorter wavelengths = more dielectric pulses = smaller spatial geometry which also = higher dielectric capacitance.
Literally the
power increases on two levels exponentially as wavelengths decrease! More pulses and more power. Smaller confining EM
geometry,
higher dielectric capacitance.

**Below: On the left showing the spatial EM boundaries as proportional to the wavelengths and likewise therefore to the
radial
capacitance of the dielectric coaxial carrier. On the right, showing wavelength deflection, the refraction gradient thru
the
dielectric glass or plastic medium.**

**Below: Dielectric radial pulse capacitance occurs proportional to the wavelengths, shorter wavelengths carry more
kinetic
energy, longer wavelengths carry less.**

**Below: Shorter wavelength light contains higher dielectric capacitance, and likewise are more kinetic in their energy
transfer.
On right, shorter wavelength light is deflected more due to the rate at which the induction can occur in the medium of
transmission, thru the dielectric capacitor (or ‘insulator’, i.e. glass etc.).**

**Kha and other words denoting ‘zero’, the metaphysics of counterspace, and the ancient wheel analogy of**

**space & counterspace**

_Adapted from the works of Dr. A.K. Coomaraswamy, of which his son, Dr. R.P. Coomaraswamy, has granted me full rights to
all his
fathers’ works in 2006._

**Below: All cubic space is the resultant of magnetic divergence, as necessitated without exceptions, 0 = X-X. Zero does
not exist,
rather as both meant and implied unmanifest inertia in counterspace; i.e. the Ether. The ‘square’ piece lower left is
the exact
same piece on the right, only from a different angle.**

Kha, cf. Greek Xaos, is generally "cavity"; and in the Rg Veda, particularly "the hole in the nave of a wheel through
which the axle
runs" (Monier Williams). A. N. Singh has shown conclusively that in Indian mathematical usage, current during the
earlier centuries
of the Christian era, kha means "zero";Suryadeva, commenting on Aryabhata, says that "the khas refer to voids (khaini
sunya upa
lakptani) ...thus khadvinake means the eighteen places denoted by zeros." Among other words denoting zero are sunya,
akasa, vyoma,
antariksa, nabha, ananta, and purna. We are immediately struck by the fact that the words sunya, "void," and purna, "
plenum," should
have a common reference; the implication being that all numbers are virtually or potentially present in that which is
without number;
expressing this as an equation, 0= X - X, it is apparent that zero is to number as possibility is to actuality. Again,
employment of the
term ananta with the same reference implies an identification of zero with infinity; the beginning of all series being
thus the same as
their end. This last idea, we may observe, is met with already in the earlier metaphysical literature, for example RV
IV.I.II, where
Agni is described as "hiding both his ends (guhamano anta) "; AB 111.43, "the Agnistoma is like a chariot wheel,
endless (ananta)";
JUB 1.35, "the Year is endless (ananta), its two ends (anta) are Winter and Spring... so is the endless chant (anantam
saman)." These
citations suggest that it may be possible to account for the later mathematicians selection of technical terms by
reference to an earlier
usage of the same or like terms in a purely metaphysical context.
Our intention being to demonstrate the native connection of the mathematical terms kha (zero, counterspace), etc., with
the same
terms as employed in purely metaphysical contexts, it will be necessary to prepare the diagram of a circle or cosmic
wheel (cakra,

mandala) and to point out the significance of the relationships of the parts of such a diagram according to universal
tradition and more
particularly in accordance with the formulation of the Rg Veda. Take a piece of blank paper of any dimensions, mark a
point
anywhere upon it, and With this point as center draw two concentric circles of any radii, but one much less than the
other; draw any
radius from the center to the outer circumference. With exception of the center, which as a point is necessarily without
dimension,
note that every part of our diagram is merely representative; that is, the number of circles may be indefinitely
increased, and the
number of radii likewise, each circle thus filled up becoming at last a plane continuum, the extended ground of any
given world or
state of being; for our purpose we are considering only two such worlds mythologically speaking, Heaven and Earth, or
psychologically, the worlds of subject and object as forming together the world or cosmos, typical of any particularized
world which
may be thought of as partial within it. Finally, our diagram may be thought of either as consisting of two concentric
circles with their
common radii and one common center, or as the diagram of a wheel, with its felly, nave, spokes, and axle point. Nabha,
from nabh, to
"expand," etc., as also in nabhi, "navel" and "nave." A secondary sense of nabh is "to destroy” (in counterspace,
voidance). Actually to
represent all possible states of being, the Wheel would have to be conceived in the manner of a gyroscope, revolving
simultaneously
in an indefinite number of planes, though still with a motionless center: just as the Cross must be thought of from this
point of view as
constituted of three arms, mutually at right angles, intersecting at the one common point which is also the center of
the sphere in
which the Cross stands. Actually, however, this would be to introduce a needless complication, and in fact the symbol as
employed is
essentially an ordinary chariot wheel, just as also in common usage the two armed cross stands for a cross extended in
three directions.
Although, then, the Wheel, as the "round of the world " and "earth plain," strictly speaking corresponds only to a given
ensemble of
conditions it represents analogically the indefinite totality of all possible conditions, the entirety of samsara. As
thus representing the
Universe in its entirety, the Wheel symbol remains in use unchanged from Rg Veda. The content of the wheel symbolism is
extraordinarily rich, and can only be outlined here.. Its dimensions are indefinite, its radius the variable distance
between an
undimensioned (amatra) point and an immeasurable (asankhya) circumference; there in the `middle space" (antariksa,
akasa), between
the "I" and the "not I," essence and nature, lie procession and recession (pravrtti, nivrtti), there are good and evil (
dharmadharmau),
joy and sorrow (sukha, duhkha), light and shade (chayatapa), birth end death, all local movement and affection; and that
motion and
passibility are greater the greater the distance from the centre. Beyond the felly lies only the inexistence of the
irrational, an
impossibility of existence, as of square circles or the horns' of a hare; within the nave, the non existence of the
supra rational. The
cycle of ego consciousness implies an outward movement from the nave to the ever-receding felly, and a return from the
however
distant felly to the unchanging center. A progressive enlightenment (krama mukti) can then be expressed 'as a gradual
contraction of
the radius, bringing the circumference ever closer to the center, until that which seemed to enclose the point is seen
to lie contained
within it, knowledge being thus con centrated into a single form, which is the form of very different things. That is
Nirvana, unitary
being, "with residual existential elements," and by a vanishment of the point becomes also epistrophe, synthesis,
without residuum of
existence.

**Below: The magneto-dielectric archetype, seen face on.**

Now in the first place, as a geometrical symbol, that is to say with respect to measure or numeration, our diagram
represents the
logical relationships of the concepts naught or zero, inconnumerable unity, and indefinite multiplicity; the blank (
sunnya) surface
having no numerical significance; the central point (Indu, bindu) being an inconnumerable unity (inconnumerable,
advaita, because
there cannot be conceived a second center); and either circumference an endless (ananta) series of points, which may be
thought of as
numbers; the totality (sarvam) of the numbered, that is to say individual, points representing the sum of a
mathematically infinite
series extending from one to "infinity," and conceivable as plus or minus according to the direction of procedure. The
whole area
(sarira) delimited corresponds to place (desa), a revolution of the circles about their center corresponds to time (
kala). It will be
observed further that any radius connects analogous or corresponding points or numbers on the two circumferences; if,
now, we
suppose the radius of one or both circles indefinitely reduced, which brings us to the central point as limiting
concept (that is also "as
it was in the beginning"), it is evident that even this point can be thought of only as a plenum of all the numbers
represented on either
circumference. On the other hand, this point, at the same time that it represents an inconnumerable unity and, as we
have seen, a
plenum, must also be thought of as representing, that is, as the symbol of, zero, for two reasons: (1) inasmuch as the
concept to which
it refers is by definition without place and without dimensions, and therefore nonexistent, and (2) the mathematically
infinite series,
thought of as both plus and minus according to direction, cancel out where all directions meet in common focus.
So far as I know, Indian literature does not provide a specifically geometrical exegesis exactly corresponding to what
is given in
the preceding paragraph. What we do find in the metaphysical and religious traditions is a corresponding usage of the
symbol of the
Wheel (primarily the solar chariot, or a wheel thereof), and it is in this connection that we first meet with some of
the most significant
of those terms which are later on employed by the mathematicians. In RV 1.155.6 and 1.164.2, II, 13, 14, 48; AV x.8.4 7;
KB xx.i;
JUB 1.35; BU 1.5.15; Svet. Up. 1.4; PS 6, and like texts, the year as an everlasting sequence is thought of as an
unwasting wheel of
life, a revolving wheel of the Angels, in which all things have their being and are manifested in succession; "none of
its spokes is last
in order" (RV v.85.5). **_The parts of the wheel are named as follows:_** ani, the axle point within the nave (note that
the axle causes
revolution, but does not itself revolve); kha, nabhi, the nave (usually as space within the hub, occasionally as the hub
itself); ara,
spoke, connecting hub and felly; nemi, pavi, the felly. It should be observed that nabhi, from nabh, to expand, is
also "navel"; similarly
in anthropomorphic formulation, "navel" corresponds to "space" (MU vi.6); in the Rg Veda, the cosmos is constantly
thought of as
"expanded" (pin) from this chthonic center. We considered above mainly the case in which the cosmic wheel is thought of
as single

perhaps more often the chariot of the Sun is thought of as running on twin wheels connected by a common axle tree (
aksa), and this
involves a consideration of the world from two distinct but inseparable points of view. As the Sure shines equally for
angels and for
men (leg Veda, I, 50, 5, etc.), so of the twin wheels of his chariot one touches Heaven, the other Earth (Rg Veda, I,
30, 19, and. X, 85,
18); and their common axle tree is identified with the axis of the universe that holds apart (vitaram, visvak) Heaven
and Earth (Rg
Veda., V, Z9, 4, and X, 89, 4). Or again, when the chariot of the Sun is thought of as three wheeled (tricakra), Rg
Veda, X, 85, two of
the wheels are identified, as aforesaid with Heaven and Earth ("one looks down upon the several worlds, the other
ordains the seasons
and is born again," cf. I, 164, 44 and 32), and these "proceed by magic”, mayaya caranti; but the third is hidden (
guha’ = guhayam
nihitam, sc. "in the heart "), and only the adepts (addhatayah) are Comprehensors (viduh) thereof. This third wheel
evidently
corresponds to the "secret name”. These doctrines of three wheels, three lights, etc., are tantamount to the trikaya
doctrine. The axle
tree of the twin wheels (which axle must be thought of analogically also as penetrating the third wheel) is the primary
source of
moving power, or Brahma (as rooted incidentally in leg Veda, I,166,.9): not itself revolving (important), it is the
unmoved mover in
relation to the wheels. But to complete our understanding of the pratika it must be realized that the revolution of the
wheel requires the
operation of an opposing force operative at the felly, where in actual experience contact with the ground supplies a
fulcrum. In other
words, revolution depends on the interaction of conjoint principles, which may be galled Heaven and Earth, Purusa and
Prakrti, sattva
and tames, I and not I, subject and object, etc. This is recognized in several passages in which the infixation of the
axle, or the
movement of the wheels, is effected by the deity by means of his abilities (sacibhih, Rg Veda, 1, 30, 15, and X, 89, 4),
powers
(8`aktibhih, X, 88, 10), or magic (mayaya, X, 85, 18), saci, Sakti, and maya being synonymous feminine designations of
his "means
whereby," the "ground" of manifestation, cooperating with his "essence," who is Sacipati, Mayin, etc. The axle tree is
also the axis of
the universe, as most clearly stated in Rg Veda, X, 89, 4, yo akseneva cakriya sacibhih visvak tastambha prthivim uta
dyam, "by the
axle of his wheeled car indeed, by his abilities, he pillars apart Heaven and Earth”.
In China we shall be concerned with only two stone objects, or perforates; these objects of jade are symbols of Heaven
and Earth.
Of these two perforates, the Tsung, or Earth symbol is internally tubular and externally cubical (figure 15), while the
pi, or Heaven
symbol is a perforated circular disk or ringstone (figure 16). It is interesting that these Tsung are regularly thought
of “cart wheels” or
“wheel hubs”. But the “ancient jade chariot” no more implies an actual chariot of jade used than does the Vedic chariot
of light or
biblical chariot of fire refer to vehicles that might be unearthed by archeologists. These are purely symbolic
representation of space
and counterspace, earth and the unseen, counterspace, conventionally ‘Heaven’.

**Below: Symbols of Heaven and Earth. Of these two perforates, the Tsung, or Earth symbol is internally tubular and

Certain passages indicating the metaphysical significance of the terms ani, kha, and nabhi in the Rg Veda may now be
cited. It
should be premised that we find here in connection with the constant use of the wheel symbol, and absence of a purely
geometrical
formulation, the term ani employed to express ideas later on referred to by the words indu or bindu. Vedic ani, being
the axle point
within the nave of the wheel, and on which the wheel revolves, corresponds exactly to Dante's "il pumadello stelo al cui
la prima rota
va dintorno" (Paradiso XIII.I I I2). The metaphysical significance of the ani is fully brought out in RV 1.35.6, anim na
rathyam amrta
adhi tasthuh, "as on the axle point of the chariot wheel are actually existent the
undying [Angels or intellectual principles]," which also
supplies the answer to the well known problem, "How many Angels can stand on the point of a needle?" More often the nave
of the

wheel, rather than the axle point specifically, is treated as its center; nor need this confuse us if we reflect that
just as under limiting
conditions (indefinite reduction of the radius, or when the central point has been identified but the circle not yet
drawn) the center
represents the circle, so under similar conditions (metaphysically, in principio) the axle point implies the nave or
even the whole wheel
the point without dimension, and a principial space not yet expanded (or as the Rg Veda would express it, "closed")
being the same in
reference. The nave then, kha or nabhi, of the world wheel is regarded as the receptacle and fountain of all order,
formative ideas, and
goods: for example, 11.28.5, rahydmato varuna kham rtasya, "may we, O Varuna, win thy nave of Law"; viii.4I.6, where in
Trita
Aptya "all oracles (kavyd) are set as is the nave within the wheel (cakre nabhir iva) "; IV.28, where Indra opens the
closed or hidden
naves or rocks (apihita... khani in verse I, apihitani asna in verse 5) and thus releases the Seven Rivers of Life. In
v.32.I, where
Indra breaks open the Fountain of Life (utsam), this is again an emptying out of the hollows (khani), whereby the
fettered floods are
released. The Rivers, of course, represent ensembles of possibility (hence they are often spoken of as "maternal") with
respect to a like
number of "worlds," or planes of being, as in 1.22.16, prthivya sapta dhamabhih. Our terms kha, asna, etc., are
necessarily employed
in the plural when the "creation" is envisaged with respect to the cosmos not as a single "world," but as composed of
two, three, or
seven originally unmanifested but now to be conceptually distinguished "worlds"; the solar chariot having one, two,
three, or seven
wheels, accordingly. It is perhaps because the chariot of the Year is more often than not thought of as two wheeled (
Heaven and Earth,
Counterspace and Space), and therefore provided with two analogous axle points, that ani was not later employed as a
verbal symbol
of "one."
According to an alternative formulation, all things are thought of as ante principium shut up within, and in principio
as proceeding
from, a common ground, rock, or mountain (budhna, adri, parvata, etc.): this ground, thought of as resting island like
within the
undifferentiated sea of universal possibility (x.89.4, where the waters pour sagarasya budhnat), is merely another
aspect of our axle
point (,dni), regarded as the primary assumption toward which the whole potentiality of existence is focused by the
primary acts of
intellection and will. This means that a priori undimensioned space (kha, akasa, etc.) underlies and is the mother of
the point, rather
than that the latter has an independent origin; and this accords with the logical order of thought, which proceeds from
potentiality to
actuality, nonbeing to being. This ground or point is, in fact, the "rock of ages" (asmany anante, 1.130.3; adrim...
acyutam, v1.i7.5).
Here ante principium Agni lies occulted (guha santam, 1.141.3, etc.) as Ahi Budhnya, "in the ground of space, concealing
both his
ends" (budhne rajaso... guhamdno ants, iv.i.ii, where it may be noted that guhamano anta is tantamount to ananta,
literally "end less,"
"in-finite," "eternal"), hence he is called "chthonic" (nabhir agni prthivya, 1.59.2, etc.), and is born in this
ground (jayata prathamah..

. budhne, iv.i.ii) and stands erect, Janus like, at the parting of the ways (ayor ha skambha... patham visarge, x.5.6) ;
hence he gets his
chthonic steeds and other treasures (asvabudhna, x.8.3; budhnya vasuni, v11.6.7). It is only when this rock is cleft
that the hidden
trine are freed, the waters flow (1.62.3, where Brhaspati bhinad adrim and vidadgah; v.4i.i2, srnvanty dpah... adreh).
This is,
moreover, a center without place, and hence when the Waters have come forth (that is, when the cosmos has come to be)
one asks, as
in x.iii.8, "where is their beginning (agram), where their ground (budnah), where now, ye Waters, your innermost
center (madhyam..
. antah).
Thus metaphysically, in the symbolism of the Wheel, of counterspace, the surface blank (sunya) in the initial nonbeing (
asat) of
any formulation (samkalpa) represents the truly infinite (aditi) and maternal possibility of being; the axle point or
nave, exemplary
being (visvam ekam, RV 111.54.8 = integral omnipresence); the actual construction, a mentally accomplished partition of
being into
existences; each spoke, the integration of an individual as nama-rupa (psycho physical), that is, as archetypal inwardly
and
phenomenal outwardly; the felly, the principle of multiplicity (visamatva). Or, employing a more theological
terminology: the
undetermined surface represents the Godhead (aditi, parabrahman, tamas, apah) ; the axle point or immovable rock, God (
aditya,
aparabrahman, isvara, jyoti) ; the circle of the nave, Heaven (svarga);any point on the circumference of the nave, an
intellectual
principle (nama, deva) ; the felly, Earth with its analogous (anurupa) phenomena (visva rupani); the construction of the
wheel, the
sacrificial act of creation (karma, srsti), its abstraction, the act of dissolution (laya). Furthermore, the course (
gati) of any individual
upon the pathway of a spoke is in the beginning **centrifugal (pravrtta, bhava, samsarati, paticcasamuppada) and then
again
centripetal (nivrtta, nisbandhu, epistrophe, samadhi, synthesis etc.),** until the center (madhya) is found; and when
the center of
individual being coincides with the center of the wheel, he is emancipated (mukta), the extension of the wheel no longer
involving him
in local motion, at the same time that its entire circuit now becomes for him one picture (jagaccitra) seen in
simultaneity, who as
"round about seer," paridrastr, now "overlooks everything," visvam... abhicaste, 1.164.44.
In order to understand the use of terms for "space" (kha, ukasa, antariksa, sunya, etc.), rather counterspace, as verbal
symbols of
zero (which represents privation of number, and is yet a matrix of number in the sense 0 = X-X), it must be realized
that akasa, etc.,
represent primarily a concept not of physical space, but of a purely principal space without dimension, though the
matrix of
dimension." For example, "all these beings arise out of the space (akasad samapadyanta) and return into the space (
akasam pratyastam
yanti). For the space is older than they, prior to them, and is their last resort (parayanam)," CU I.9.I; "space is the
name of the
permissive cause of individual integration (akaso vai nama namarupayor nirvahita)," CU VIII.I4; and just as India "opens
the closed
spaces (apihitj khani)," RV IV.2H.I, so the Self "awakens this rational [cosmos] from chat space (akasat esa khalu idam
cetamatram
dobhayati)," MU VI.I7, in other words, ex nihilo fit. Furthermore, the locus of this "space" is "within you": "what i's
the intrinsic
aspect of expansion is the supernal fiery energy in the vacance of the inner man (tat svarupam nabhasah khe
antarbhutasya yat param
tejah)," MU VII.II; and this same "space in the heart" (antarhrdaya akasa) is the locus (dyatana, vesma, nada, kosla,
etc.) where are
deposited in secret (guha nihitam) all that is ours already or may be ours on any plane (loka) of experience (CU
VIII.I.I 3). At the
same time, in BU v.i, this "ancient space" (kha) is identified with the Absolute and with the Spirit (kham brahma, kham
puranam,
vayuram kham iti), and this Absolute is at the same time a plenum or pleroma (purna) such that "when plenum is taken
from plenum,
plenum yet remains.”
Here we get precisely that equivalence of kha and puma, void and plenum, which was remarked upon as noteworthy in the
verbal

notation of the mathematicians. The thought, moreover, is almost literally repeated when Bhaskara in the Bijaganita
defines the term
ananta thus: ayam ananto rasih khahara ity ucyate. Asmin vikarah khahare na rasavapi pravistesvapi nihsrtesu bahusvapi
syal
layasrstikale 'nante 'cyute bhutaganesu yadvat, that is, "This fraction of which the denominator is zero, is called an
infinite quantity. In
this quantity consisting of that which has cipher for its divisor, there is no alteration, though many be added or
subtracted; just as there
is no alteration in the Infinite Immovable (anante acyute) at the time of the emanation or resolution of worlds, though
hosts of beings
are emanated or withdrawn." In Rg Veda, X, 85, 12, "the chariot is in the mode of Intellect (anomanasmayam), the Breath
of Life
(vyana) was the axle (aksa) fastened there." It will be understood that the axle point (ani) that penetrates the
hollow (kha) in the nave
(na’bhi) is central in each wheel; so in Rg Veda, I, 35, 6, the Undying Angels (se. the Several Angels, visve devah,
Adityas) are said to
depend upon Savitr (the Supernal Sun as prime mover) "as on the chariot's axle point (ani)," and in Aitareya A.ranyaka,
II, 7, the Self
is compared to the "twin axle points (ani) "'of the Veda. We have thus dwelt at some length on the Vedic implications of
the wheel or
wheels, because it is important to realize the wider content and consequent power of this symbol, which was so
extensively employed
in metaphysics, though with a more restricted application.
It may be observed further that while in the Rg Veda we "do not find the use of names of things to denote numbers, we do
find
instances of numbers demoting things." In vii.103.1, for example, the number "twelve" denotes the "year"; in X.71.3, "
seven" stands
for "rivers of life" or "states of being." It is thus merely a converse usage of words when the mathematicians make use
of the names of
things to denote numbers; to take the most obvious examples, it is just what should be expected, when we find that r is
expressed by
such words as adi, indu, abja, prthvi; 2 by such as yama, asvina; 3 by such as agni, vaisvanara, haranetra, bhuvana; 4
by veda, dis,
yuga, samudra, etc.; 5 by prana; 6 by rtu; and so forth. It is not to be understood, of curse, that the number words are
all of Vedic
origin; many suggest rather an Epic vocabulary, e.g., pandava for 5, while others, such as netra for 2, have an obvious
and secular
source. In certain cases an ambiguity arises, for example, loka as representing either 3 or 14, dis as representing 4 or
10, but this can
be readily understood; in the last mentioned case, for example, the quarters have been thought of in one and the same
cosmology as
either four, or if we count up eight quarters and half quarters, adding the zenith and nadir, as ten. Taken in its
entirety as cited by
Singly the numeral vocabulary can hardly antedate the beginning of the Christian era (we find that 10 is represented,
among other
words, by avatara; and 6 by raga).
If we attempt to account for the forms of the ideograms of numbers in a similar fashion, we shall be on much less
certain ground. A
few suggestions may nevertheless be made. For example, a picture writing of the nation "axle point" could only have been
a "point,"
and of the concept "nave" could only have been a "round O," and both of these signs are employed at the present day to
indicate
"zero." The upright line that represents "one" may be regarded as a pictogram of the axis that penetrates the naves of
the dual wheels,
and thus at once unites and separates Heaven and Earth. The Devandgari and Arabic signs for "three" correspond to the
trident
(trisula), which is known to have been from very ancient times a symbol of Agni or Siva. A priori it might be expected
that a sign for
"four" should be cruciform, following the notion of extension in the directions of the four airs; and in fact we find in
Saka script that
"four" is represented by a sign X, and that the Devandgari may well be thought of as a cursive form derived from a like
prototype.
Even if there be sufficient foundation for such suggestions, it is hardly likely that a detailed interpretation of
ideograms of numbers
above four could now be deduced. We can only say that the foregoing suggestions as to the nature of numerical ideograms
rather
support than counter the views of those who seek to derive the origins of symbolism, script, and speech from the concept
of the circuit
of the year.
It is, however, beyond question that many of the verbal symbols the case of kha for "zero" or counterspace is
conspicuous; used by
Indian mathematicians had an earlier currency, that is to say before a development of mathematical science as such, in a
more
universal, metaphysical context. That a scientific terminology should thus have been formulated on the basis of a
metaphysical
terminology, and by no means without a full consciousness of what was being done (as the citation from Bhaskara clearly
shows), is
not only in accordance with all that we know of the natural course of Indian thought, which takes the universal for
granted and
proceeds to the particular, but also admirably illustrates what from a traditionally orthodox point of view would be
regarded as
constituting a natural and right relationship of any special science to the metaphysical background of all sciences. One
is reminded of
words in the Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII, dated 1879, on the "Restoration of Christian Philosophy": "Hence, also, the
physical
sciences, which now are held in so much repute, and everywhere draw to themselves a singular admiration, because of the
wonderful
discoveries made in them, would not only take no harm from a restoration of the philosophy of the ancients, but would
derive great
protection from it. For the fruitful exercise and increase of these sciences it is not enough that we consider facts and
contemplate
Nature. When the facts are well known we must rise higher, and give our thoughts with great care to understanding the
nature of
corporeal things, as well as to the investigation of the laws which they obey, and of the principles from which spring
their order, their
unity in variety, and their common likeness in diversity. It is marvelous what power and light and help are given to
these
investigations by Scholastic philosophy, if it be wisely used...there is no contradiction, truly so called, between the
certain and proved
conclusions of recent physics, and the philosophical principles of the Schools." These words by no, means represent a
merely
Christian apologetic, but rather enunciate u generally valid procedure, in which the theory of the universal acts at the
same time with
suggestive force and normatively with respect to more specific applications. We may reflect, on the one hand, that the
decimal system,
with which the concept "zero" is inseparably connected, was developed by Indian scholars who were very surely, as their
own words
prove, deeply versed in and dependent upon an older and traditional metaphysical interpretation of the meaning of the
world; and on
the other, that had it not been for its boasted and long maintained independence of traditional metaphysics (in which
the principles, if
not the facts, of relativity are explicit), modern scientific thought might have reached much sooner than has actually
been the case a
scientifically valid formulation and proof of such characteristic notions as those of an expanding universe and the
finity of physical
space. What has been outlined above with respect to the special science of mathematics represents a principle no less
valid in the case
of the arts, as could easily be demonstrated at very great length. For example, what is implied by the statement in
ABVI.27, that "it is

in imitation of the angelic works of art that any work of art such as a garment or chariot is made here, is actually to
be seen in the
hieratic arts of every traditional culture, and in the characteristic motifs of the surviving folk arts everywhere. Or
in the case of
literature: epic (Volsunga Saga, Beowulf, the Cuchullain and Arthurian cycles, Mahdbhdrata, Buddhacarita, etc.) and
fairy tale
(notably, for example, jack and the Beanstalk) repeat with infinitely varied local coloring the one story of jatavida,
Genesis. The whole
point of view can, indeed, be recognized in the Indian classification of traditional literature, in which the
treatises (sastras) on auxiliary
science such as grammar, astronomy, law, medicine, architecture, etc., are classed as Vedanga, "limbs or powers of the
Veda," or as
Upaveda", accessory with respect to the Veda".

**Experimenters are blooming with thoughts and wonderful new vortex testing based upon this work.**

**Vortex technology is the future, and it is already here and about to explode on the world!**

Ever since the second edition of the book has come out there has been a small explosion of new experimentation and
investigation
by open minded do-it- yourself types. Some are even those with hundreds of videos and significant background and skills
in electrical
engineering that amazed themselves upon investigation of the magnetic vortex, or hyperboloid. It’s untapped potential
and the missing
dielectric ‘secret’ behind the entire premise of the “magnet” has countless inventions yet to be discovered. Even
myself, I have
uncovered a small handful, some with amazing potential, some just intellectually amazing, yet all were expected to by
there by myself,
and they in fact are there and were there when tested. A new dawn on vortex communication, vortex technology is rounding
the corner
hard and fast!
