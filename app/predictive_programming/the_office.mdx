## The Office

### George Howard Skub

Toby gets called for jury duty and investigates a potential serial killer case during Season 6 of The Office,
specifically in the episode "The Delivery".
Toby first voices his doubts about the Scranton Strangler jury trial in the season 7 episode "Michael's Last Dundies"
. During his acceptance speech for the "Extreme Repulsiveness" award,
he announces that he was on the jury that found the Scranton Strangler guilty but is "not so sure he's guilty anymore

In season 9, the plot point is abruptly resolved when Skub actually tries to strangle Toby, thus 'proving' his guilt.
Normally everything in the show's plot was fully thought out, but in this case, the conclusion makes no sense.
The show could not possibly conclude with what was obvious -
that we systematically throw innocent people in jail.
