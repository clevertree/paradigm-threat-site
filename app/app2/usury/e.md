"It's a sick society when our weapons have more jewelry than our wives!"

 commenting on Tomahawk Cruise Missiles containing 15 kilograms of silver each.

"The most hated sort of moneymaking, and with the greatest reason, is usury, which makes a gain out of money itself, 
and not from the natural use of it. For money was intended to be used in exchange, but not to increase at interest. 
And this term usury which means the birth of money from money, is applied to the breeding of money, because the 
offspring resembles the parent. Wherefore of all modes of making money this is the most unnatural." 
-- [Aristotle](https://classicalwisdom.com/greek_books/politics-by-aristotle-book-i/4/) (384-322 BCE)

"The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece 
of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. 
The Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create deposits, 
and with the flick of a pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. 
However, take it away from them, and all the fortunes like mine will disappear, 
and they ought to disappear, for this world would be a happier and better world to live in. 
But if you wish to remain slaves of the Bankers and pay for the cost of your own slavery, 
let them continue to create deposits." 
-- [Sir Josiah Stamp](https://lifeondoverbeach.wordpress.com/2020/06/13/josiah-stamp-banking-was-conceived-in-iniquity-and-born-in-sin/),
(President of the Bank of England in the 1920s, the second richest man in Britain)

"The Bank, its property and assets and all deposits and other funds entrusted to it shall be immune in time of peace 
and in time of war from any measure such as expropriation, requisition, seizure, confiscation, prohibition or restriction o
f gold or currency export or import, and any other measure." -- Article 10, Instrument of Foundation, 
Bank of International Settlements
"When the world around the IMF goes downhill, we thrive. We become extremely active because we lend money, we earn interest and charges and all the rest of it, and the institution does well. When the world goes well and we've had years of growth, as was the case back in 2006 and 2007, the IMF doesn't do so well both financially and otherwise." 
[-- Christine Lagarde](https://books.google.com/books?id=PzslDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=%22We%20Thrive%22)
