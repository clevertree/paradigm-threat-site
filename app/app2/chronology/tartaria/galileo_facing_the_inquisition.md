Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered, to abstain completely from teaching or defending this
doctrine and opinion or from discussing it... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the
center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either
orally or in writing.
