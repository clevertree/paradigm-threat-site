# Let's Do The Time Warp Again

by Geri Roberts

As I was starting to write about the murder of Pope John Paul I, I realized there was a problem. A big problem. A
problem at the core of ALL conspiracy study, or, as I prefer to call it, The Search for Truth. It is the problem of
TIME. My observations about the behavior of the Papacy rely on the history of the Vatican, which rests on the shifting
sands of false time because our conception of the history of the City of Rome is fallacious because it is dependent upon
the totally incorrect dating of the Crucifixion and an historical Christ figure and the inception of Christianity and
the whole-cloth invention of "ancient civilizations". There is an enormous, smelly pachyderm sitting in our living rooms
called CHRONOLOGY.

I first heard of Anatoly Fomenko's work about three years ago while listening to the Crrow777 podcast. Anatoly Fomenko (
b. 1935 in Russia), according to the back cover of his book uses statistical analysis, computer programs and astronomy
to prove that our consensual history of what happened in the world before the 16th Century is a cunningly wrought "magic
fabric" of lies. You see, the chronology of our entire civilization hangs upon the backbone of "Ancient Rome."
EVERYTHING in archeology is dated from that timeline. Only there is no ancient Rome. But that is just the first of the
poisoned wells of history we have all been drinking from.. The control methods perfected by the parasitic Nefarious
Elite are based upon this fraudulent chronology .and used to drive us into ideological cattle chutes. I once said that
the JFK assassination was the mothership of conspiracy theories and that all roads in Conspiracy Land lead to Kennedy.
Maybe it would be more precise to say that all roads in Conspiracy Land lead to Rome.

Why has this been done to us? See below:

I've tried to squeeze the basics of Fomenko into a tiny nutshell. A clumsy effort, so bear with me:: A thousand years
has been added to our history. This time-that-never-happened is filled in with accounts of "Dark Ages" in Europe and
manufactured "ancient civilizations" of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome. The Bible was written circa the 15th
century and described recent events. The historic Christ. figure was born in the Crimea 1152 A.D. and crucified in 1185
A.D. Whether or not he was actually the son of God is outside my scope of interest. Modern religions were manufactured
out of this event that occurred about eight hundred years ago, not two thousand years ago. Our history has been shifted
backwards and made to seem a thousand years older than it really is.

Fomenko's work identifies two chronological architects responsible for this deception: Josephus Iustus Scaliger (
1540-1609) and Dionysius Petavius (1583-1652). Both have links to the Jesuit orders. No surprise there!  Unquestioningly
using an "ecclesiastical tradition"  and Biblical dating from the theologians of the Middle Ages they laid out the dates
of ancient history without reference to any primary sources at all. This chronology was created under the paradigm of
the Catholic Church of Western Europe and in later centuries would be foisted upon us as "scientific."  It's not.

There is not a single source or artifact that can be reliably traced back in history any earlier than the 11th Century.
And that is pushing it. Many people claim the earliest definite sources exist no earlier than the 15th Century.

I must point out that Fomenko has been described as an asset of Soviet/Russian intelligence. No doubt he is. EVERYBODY
in academe, especially in the sciences and most especially in Russia, is controlled by tentacles of the Deep State.
Research and information are a valuable resource that must be controlled and weaponized. That doesn't mean that it is
not real. Disinformation is an artform that could make us discount valuable information simply by linking it to "
intelligence."

I was still a newcomer to Conspiracy Land when I heard the Crrow podcast and was incredulous. I reacted to the news with
measured, calm curiosity.   "WHAAAAAT THE FUUUUUCK?" I howled. I ordered the first book although it was expensive. I had
to have it. I was sure it would provide material for my comedy writing. Back then I thought this conspiracy stuff I was
starting to read was terribly amusing. I did not yet understand that I had it all backwards, that the "mainstream"
version of history was ridiculous and not the "new chronology" version.

Fomenko's first book, History: Fiction or Science Chronology 1 ran over me like an express train. I had to know more.
Eventually I had all his books (on history, that is. He has written many on mathematics). I could not stop reading the
things. My brain told me they were truthful, but my inner nerd who deeply loves the mainstream fairy tale of history
sobbed "NO, NO, NO."

Why did I accept this seemingly crazy uber-conspiracy theory that 99.9% of the population of Earth probably will never
hear of, let alone believe in?

I have to admit that I do not have the background, or the brain power, to completely understand the particulars of
Fomenko's astronomical and statistical research and proofs. The only reason I am not still sitting in my high school
algebra class is because the teacher simply could not bear to look at me for another semester. He told me I had failed
AGAIN but gave me a D instead of an F so I wouldn't come back any more. Yes, i did deserve the F because I spent most of
his class reading Georgette Heyer novels hidden inside the textbook. Since the first grade I had been tortured with the
hellish workings of mathematics and was never able to comprehend any of it. I knew that I could sit in that algebra
classroom until the suns of the galaxies died and I still would not understand anything that man said. So I decided I
might as well get some reading done.

But I do comprehend the general outlines, I think, of Fomenko's researches in astronomy.. His astronomical observations
are based on the sky clock,. Crrow777's dictum that the stars are the only truly accurate time keeping available to us
humans greatly impressed me. Think about how The Nefarious Elite try to hide from us the importance of the positions and
movements of the stars and planets and their true nature. This is why NASA was created; not to study the firmament but
to conceal it.

Statistics are as incomprehensible to me as algebra but they are an infernal art used as a key tool of every field of
science, it seems. So why shouldn't Fomenko apply them to chronology?:   :"The new concept of chronology is based
primarily on applying methods of modern statistics to the analysis of historical sources and extensive cybernetic
computation."  (History:  Fiction or Science Chronology 1 page xxiii)

For me, the ring of truth of the New Chronology lies in the myriad puzzles and riddles that litter mainstream history.
There are little holes of nonsense that catch your eye but historians are trained to explain them away. That is what
historians do. They patch the fabric of our history with theories and narratives based upon pure conjecture. We are
conditioned to believe anything an academic says rather than looking for our own answers.. I find lots of clues to the
true nature of the past in these inconsistencies.

For example, why did "Renaissance" artists (by the way, the "Renaissance" never happened) paint people in Biblical
scenes wearing contemporary garb?. Historians make up the silliest reasons because they simply can't explain it and will
never state the obvious:  THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE WORE WHEN THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN. They dressed like medieval people because
that is what they were. The cities and houses and furnishings in these paintings are consistent with those of the middle
ages.

This is just a quick summary of the massive reworking of chronology that is still ongoing. It's frightening but also
exhilarating. We might be getting a glimpse behind the curtain of our reality. We are discovering that we actually know
nothing about our past before the 11th century. It is being hidden from us. Exactly what is being hidden? And why?.
Thanks to Fomenko and other chronology researchers we might have a better idea of what questions to ask.

I've tried, very badly I'm afraid, to give a quick summary of why it is so difficult to write about the Papacy and the
Vatican, especially in regard to the assassination of John Paul I.. You see, the Vatican and the Pope are not what
people think they are. Vatican is the administrative center for a parasitic global control system. Proof? Before the
15th century papal history was very vague. As if nothing much was happening in Rome. Well nothing was happening because
Rome wasn't there. At that time the Seven Hills of Rome were home to nothing but a few goats and trees. There were no
Popes, no Colosseum, no Pantheon.. All these things appeared in the Middle Ages. The City of Rome was built in the 15th
Century to house the new center of the new "religion."  It is not ancient and the Vatican, or the Holy See, is not
Christian.
