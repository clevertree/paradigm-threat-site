> "From the foregoing evidence a distinctive portrait of Saturn emerges.
> In the earliest age recalled by the ancients the planet— or proto-planet—came forth from the cosmic sea to establish
> dominion over the primeval Cosmos.
> The planet-god ruled as the solitary, central light, worshiped as the god One—the only god in the beginning.
> Saturn's epoch left a memory of such impact that later generations esteemed the god as the Universal Monarch, the
> first
> and ideal king, during whose rule occurred the prehistoric leap, from barbarianism to civilization.
> Throughout Saturn's era of cosmic harmony no seasonal vicissitudes threatened men with hunger or starvation, and men
> suffered neither labor nor war.
> In the "creation" Saturn, the primal Seed, ejected the fiery material ("primeval matter"), which congealed into a
> circle
> of lesser lights (the Cosmos). The myths describe this resounding birth of the secondary gods as Saturn's "speech:
> Saturn was the Word or voice of heaven".
> The ancients conceived Saturn as the visible intelligence bringing forth the Cosmos as his own body and regulating its
> revolutions. Thus was the planet denominated the Heaven Man—a being eventually recalled as the prototype of the human
> race—the first ancestor.
> "When Saturn departed the world, the Golden Age catastrophically ended. This is the universal tale of the dying god,
> the
> overthrown "first king" or fallen "first man".
> Whether betrayed by a dark force, or chastised for having committed the forbidden sin, or inflicted with old age and a
> weariness of mankind, the result is the same: a corruption of nature and a progressive worsening of the human
> condition.The story is the first—and one could almost say, only—theme of tragedy and drama in antiquity: Saturn's Golden Age
> came
> to a sudden and catastrophic end, either caused by or accompanied by the fall of the great god.
> That the distant planet Saturn should loom at the center of ancient rites is a fact which conventional wisdom will not
> easily explain. One looks in vain for any characteristic of Saturn, the present-day planet, which might account for
> Saturn, the primeval god. "Could the present speck of light have provoked the ancient memory of a creator standing
> alone
> in the deep? Or produced the universal legend of the first king and the lost age of abundance? Or inspired the myth of
> the Heaven Man? "
> If, as is almost universally believed, the heavens have undergone no major changes in astronomically recent times,
> then
> the myth—however meticulously developed—can only be a fabrication, produced through the purest disregard for actual
> observation and experience. I do not ask the reader to ignore this possibility, and I am fully aware that to many
> mythologists myth and fancy are synonymous. Since the argument of this book rests on the coherence of the Saturn myth
> as
> a whole, and since many details remain to be covered. I urge only a willingness to consider the evidence in its
> entirety. Whatever the true origins of the myth, it constituted for the ancients a compelling vision—a vision
> deserving
> careful study by all students of history, religion, and mythology.
