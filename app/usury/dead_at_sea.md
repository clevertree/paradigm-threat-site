I would like to understand why majority of the world is technically "dead at sea', or under commercial law/admiralty law and its connection to the New Chronology and the Martian Deep State.
The reason is, the researchers in this space refer to Treaties in conventional history.

Those are the people, groups and channels for this space.

My theory is this was staged in England which was the first place to lose its financial sovereignty (gold traders) and give it over to the Bank/Church of England 17th century taking advantage of the year (1)666 events. Once the Deep State was able to fully flesh out a system whereby every single person born in England is the property of some bank/church owned corporation, they then spread the system to the rest of the world. The French revolted and Napoleon lost in Russia, or it would have been the French who would do this to the world

So after the 1812 MudFlood reset, when 75% of life on Earth was wiped out, England handily took over the world and imposed their DAS usury system upon us. I think the Mudflood is the big missing key as to how they accomplished this. They simply cleaned up after

For this reason, everyone we know, including celebrities, have a last name that has no history. Hugo Weaving. sigourney weaver. Natalie Portman. All of our last names were labor-class names given to us by this system

The fact that such information to get, for example, CUSIP numbers and records of live birth is getting harder to get must mean that its possible, but only if the person knows commercial law. Watch that Josh At Large video. Though I admit, it is almost impossible for people in non-Western countries to 'un-Strawman' themselves.

Josh talks about a case where CPS could not take a child without a Birth Certificate and only took the child after the mother got the child a birth certificate.

You're correct that many people have claimed to do amazing things by citing precedent and knowing their shit. However, the opposite has happened too, where they get laughed at in court for trying to prove stuff like tax is voluntary. They fake throw celebs in jail for fake tax evasion (Snipes) to make us feel like it's real. So you're right about that, but still, the average person doesn't have the tools, nor are there any real leaders around in this issue. To me that's the same thing. Just like in the Matrix where being allowed to escape to Zion made people feel like they had a choice, when they clearly didn't

I get you, but they have to trick us into legal slavery, not force us. If they could just force us, then I would conclude that we are f**d either way.

The plan was to get us there - which meant the plan to defeat the plan was to keep as much sovereignty as possible
