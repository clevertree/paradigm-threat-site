"Many events in recent and in long forgotten times occurred which have been written down by the authorities as
historical events, while in fact these events where staged. They were staged on purpose to mislead the pubic to blame a
patsy or a country for an attack which the patsy or country never committed. The culprits, or the once who gave the
order were mostly the state itself.

# II USS MAINE

The island of Cuba was first claimed by Spain in 1492 when Christopher Columbus landed on the island. They remained a
Spanish colony until the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898\. For many years the Cuban natives attempted to free
themselves from the rule of Spain and gain their independence. The horrendous actions of the Spanish in the years
leading up to this war and the yellow journalism tactics of American newspaper men like William Randolph Hearst and
Joseph Pulitzer helped gain the sympathy of the American people towards the rebel cause. The U.S. government was also
interested in controlling Cuba and the other Spanish owned Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico.

The USS Maine arrived in Havana Harbor on January 25<sup>th</sup>, 1898 to protect U.S. interests and civilians during
pro Spanish rioting in Havana. This had a calming effect on the riots. Then on February 15<sup>th</sup>the forward hull
of the Maine exploded in a devastating blast and was sunk. 266 of the 355 sailors on board were killed.

The papers of Hearst and Pulitzer wasted no time in casting the blame on the Spanish and sounded the alarm to go to war.
The Navy, in another classic case of the government investigating itself, determined that a mine caused the blast
despite the fact they had no real forensic evidence. They would not however place any blame on who was responsible for
the mine. This didn’t matter though as the U.S. public’s mind was already made up. “Remember the Maine, to hell with
Spain” was the cry. The USS Maine**[false flag](https://www.falseflag.info/help/)**was born.

The day following the blast Theodore Roosevelt wrote a letter to a friend and proclaimed, “Being a Jingo, as I am
writing confidentially, I will say, to relieve my feelings, that I would give anything if President McKinley would order
the fleet to Havana tomorrow. This Cuban business ought to stop. The Maine was sunk by an act of dirty treachery on the
part of the Spaniards, I believe; though we shall never find out definitely, and officially it will go down as an
accident.”

President McKinley went to Congress and got permission to place a blockade of Cuba on April 21<sup>st</sup>. Spain then
declared war on the U.S. on April 23<sup>rd</sup>and immediately following the U.S. followed suit and declared war on
Spain on April 25<sup>th</sup>. The war was over within three and a half months and ended August 12<sup>th</sup>with a
U.S. victory. The Treaty of Paris (1898) had Spain forfeit control of Cuba, The Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, and
parts of the West Indies.

In 1911, the Department of the Navy floated the remains of the ship and conducted another investigation. They once again
concluded that the blast was the result of a mine. Many investigators disagree and have a conflicting theory that there
was spontaneous combustion of coal next to the magazine of ammunition in the forward hull. The evidence suggests that
the blast blew outward from the hull and not inward as a mine would cause.

Regardless of whether a mine did the damage or not, Spain never claimed responsibility for the blast and the fact that
Spanish officials and civilians from the ship City of Washington helped with the survivors speaks volumes as to whether
Spain had any intentions of war towards the United States or not.

# III Manchurian Incident

Manchurian Incident or Mukden Incident, 1931, confrontation that gave Japan the impetus to set up a puppet government in
Manchuria. After the Russo-Japanese War (1904–5), Japan replaced Russia as the dominant foreign power in S Manchuria. By
the late 1920s the Japanese feared that unification of China under the Kuomintang party would imperil Japanese interests
in Manchuria. This view was confirmed when the Manchurian general Chang Hsüeh-liang , a recent convert to the
Kuomintang, refused to halt construction of railway and harbor facilities in competition with the South Manchurian
Railway , referring Japan to the Nationalist central government. When a bomb of unknown origin ripped the Japanese
railway near Shenyang (then known as Mukden), the Japanese Kwantung army guarding the railway used the incident as a
pretext to occupy S Manchuria (Sept., 1931). Despite Japanese cabinet opposition and a pledge before the League of
Nations to withdraw to the railway zone, the army completed the occupation of Manchuria and proclaimed the puppet state
of Manchukuo (Feb., 1932). See Sino-Japanese War, Second .  
See T. Yoshihashi, Conspiracy at Mukden (1963); S. N. Ogata, Defiance in Manchuria (1964).
