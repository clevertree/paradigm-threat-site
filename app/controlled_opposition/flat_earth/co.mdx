There is perhaps no greater Internet-wide PSYOP than the CIA-directed Flat Earth Conspiracy (FEC). This covert black operation has London's notorious Tavistock Institute written all over it.

The Millennium Report has posted extensively on this extremely effective PSYOP since its inception. We have felt compelled to address it one last time because of a number of prominently configured truth-tellers who either subscribe to the FEC utter nonsense or who provide a safe haven to discuss their absurd and distracting 'theories'.

How is it that some major alternative news websites even host the ridiculous ramblings of Flat Earthers ... ... ... unless they, themselves, have been set up to do so? If ever there was a universal hot-button issue on the World Wide Web that ought to send up big bright RED flags, any website or blog that takes this mental diarrhea seriously is it. Unless they are totally exposing the FEC for the wacky (yet contrived) insanity that it truly is, why even go there.

No one is saying that the current scientific paradigm that involves both astrophysics and astronomy is not full of holes. Nor is there any reason to stop questioning every aspect of those various disciplines of modern science which have been shown to fall short ... some woefully short of the mark. However, the FEC was designed from the get-go to take any rational discussion into a completely irrational direction.

Really, who doesn't know by now that NASA will lie and misrepresent whenever it behooves them to maintain their New World DisOrder? Are the sane and rational among us going to throw the baby out with the bath water because of perennial NASA prevarication?

My notes:

Flat Earthers often cite The Bible because it mentions a Firmament. The Bible also mentions a great deal of mythology
within the Golden Age that no longer has any application to today, nevertheless they seize on any mentions of the
Firmament. As mentioned thoroughly in Saturnian Cosmology Theory, the Firmament **USED TO EXIST** and no longer does
today. You can look up in the sky day or night to verify. So what did the bible reference? It referenced
[The Absu](/chronology#h3_the_absu_layers_surrounded_the_planets) also called "The Abyss" or Firmament in the
Christian Bible. This 'seal' represented multiple outer layers of Saturn's plasma sheath and appeared to humans as
obscuring equatorial rings of a cosmic 'sea' in the southern sky.

Another reference point for the FE 'movement' is the [spanish maps](https://www.raremaps.com/category/Maps/World/World)
from the 16th Century which show a great earth barrier of mountains encircling an apparently flat Earth map. While the
Spanish *spanned* the Globe in those years and knew the Earth was round, they didn't know what laid beyond the 'arctic
wall'. The reason is - those locations were unapproachable (land of Fire) as the native 'indians' of Antarctica would
light great forests fires to keep the Spanish Conquistadors away. Also at the time Newtonian Physics was gaining in
popularity among the elites (including Map Makers) and it was insisted that the Southern region of the Earth must have
as much land as the North. *For this reason*, the mapmakers envisioned a huge southern barrier of land which does not
exist in reality. Antarctica does have giant ice walls taller than the Eifel Tower, but they are not as massive as the
Spanish imagined.

The Flat Earth movement continues to grow at an insane rate. Everyone has heard about Flat Earth, but still nearly
nobody debates Hollow Earth or Saturnian Cosmology, even though both explain the Firmament and everything else in the
Bible **TO A T**. For this reason, many many many theorists have concluded long ago that the Flat Earth movement,
which is absolutely sponsored by rich corporations, is a Controlled Opposition project with a desperate motivation to
hide the truth available to all of us. Their only play left is to mock our entire debate community and make sure it is
only ever represented by the irritating dogmatic personalities of Flat Earth 'believers'.
