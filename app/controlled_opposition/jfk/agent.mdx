President John F Kennedy was never assassinated. He and his family were ordered to go along with a fake assassination.
The reason they agreed was because JFK survived a **real** assassination attempted by Richard Pavlick.
The family was told that JFK would have to endure more real attempts at assassination if he remained in power.
The reason for the assassinations was simple - JFK, a prototype [Rex Bellator](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Bellator)
modeled after Adolph Hitler was rapidly preparing America for
[War with Russia](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/cuban-missile-crisis).
JFK was starting new wars in Asia and mobilizing American
troops abroad after America was sick of war. The Deep State calculated that they could continue scaling up the
Asian war if JFK was assassinated, but would encounter resistance if he was allowed to remain president.

On November 22, 1963, JFK decided to start his campaign for re-election a year early for no apparent reason at all,
and in a location (Dallas Texas) that hated him, and during a time he was aware of assassination attempts from the
far-right. The motorcade through Dealy Plaza was an **elaborate ruse** to fake an assassination in a controlled
environment with very few witnesses. An automatronic mannequin filled with blood was modeled after his body and timed
to explode as if a gun shot had struck it. Jacqueline, Connolly (another Democrat), and his wife went along with the
hoax.

)

After Oswald denied the assassination, he was himself assassinated. Later the Warren Commission issued a
[Magic-Bullet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-bullet_theory) to further confuse the public and draw
attention away from the hoax. By feeding the public contradictions under the guise of a newly coined
term ['conspiracy theory'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#Alleged_CIA_origins),
the CIA effectively convinced the public at large that such theories are ultimately unfounded,
and that those who pursue them are operating on contradictory logic and poor reasoning skills.
A major cover-up of incriminating evidence of the actual JFK conspiracy ensued.
The Vietnam War began. Richard Pavlick fears had come true.
