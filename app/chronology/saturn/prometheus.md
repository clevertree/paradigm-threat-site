The lightning scars streaking across the surface of the inner shell of Mars lead humans to believe Prometheus is being
punished for his gift to humanity. Nine times they watch as his 'flesh' was torn apart and sown back together only to be
torn apart again later. On February 27 747 B.C.E., Mars bumps Earth's magnetosphere and once again alters the Earth's
orbital duration. Calendar keepers introduce a leap year (every 4 years) to account for the new 6-hour offset.
