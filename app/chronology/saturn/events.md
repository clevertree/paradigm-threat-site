## If we take the testimony of the ancients as a literal description of actual events, the events would have looked like this:

## 1. Saturn Joins the Sun's System and Lights Up
The Earth moved in a congregation of planets,
appearing as immense forms in the sky.
Saturn was seen as a huge stationary
body at the celestial pole.
Venus appeared squarely
in the center of Saturn
Mars appeared
inside of Venus.
Jupiter was there also
but hidden by Saturn.
The entire system moved through
a diffuse cloud of gas,
illuminated by our Sun.
On Earth, this meant that there was no
clear distinction of day and night.
At an early juncture, gaseous material or
dust stretched from Venus toward Saturn.
In periods of stability, these radiating
streams appeared as a three-pointed
and a four-pointed
star-like pattern.

## 2. Night and Day Form
Over time, the surrounding
cloud dissipated
and more clearly defined cycle
of day and night began.
A bright crescent appeared on Saturn,
created by light from our Sun.
As the Earth rotated
on its axis,
the crescent visually turned
around the polar center.

## 3. Mars Periodically Descends Towards the Earth
The smaller planet Mars was
progressively destabilized
and appeared to descend from its central
position as it moved closer to the Earth.
It returned to the
central position,
then descended still further, growing
larger with each descent.
When it visually
dropped below Venus,
a stream of material was seen
stretching between Mars and Venus.
As it continued to descend, gas and
dust began to extend towards Earth.
Lateral displacements of both
Venus and Mars occurred.
Plasma and debris spiralled
between the two planets.
Eventually, the spiraling material
gathered into a band encircling Venus.

## 4. Debris from Mars Reaches the Earth
As the planetary system
moved through space,
the appearance of the band
changed dramatically.
The vertical movements
of Mars continued,
atmosphere and other material stretching
toward the Earth with each descent.
Eventually this material reached
the Earth with disastrous effects.

## 5. Debris from Mars retreats from the Earth  
When the skies cleared,
Mars was seen moving away,
a stream of gas and
dust stretching upward
with Mars appearing as the apex
of the illuminated column.
The band encircling
Venus gradually opened.
The four streams of comet-like material
radiated once more from Venus.
And material stretching from Mars to
Earth retreated up the polar axis.

## 6. Configuration Breaks Up 
The stable period of
Saturn's domination ended
with the collapse of the
planetary configuration.
Jupiter appeared
for the first time
as Saturn tumbled from
its stationary position.

## 7. Jupiter's Reign and Demise

These events were followed by a period
of great confusion and upheaval.
With the displacement of Venus, the
band and radiating material collapsed,
spiraling between Venus and Mars and
scattering into whirl-like patterns.
There was a temporary renewal
of the configuration,
now visually dominated
by Jupiter.
And only later did the
configuration fall apart,
the planets moving into a
new, more remote equilibrium.
