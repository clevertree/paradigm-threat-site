# Reasons the Roman Empire never existed

```
Note: This investigation is a work in progress. Check back soon for more updates!
```

* Romulus kills Remus, because they were fighting over where to put “Rome”. So Romulus gets to pick the place and name
  it after himself.
* There are no real people named Romulus and Remus, it’s just a myth.
* Then they steal the whole Greek pantheon and rename them all to “Roman” names. But “Roman” isn’t a language...
* You got Latins which already existed and the Etruscan people.
* We know there were no “Romans” because there is no origin to “Romans” where did they come from even?
* If Romulus and Remus are a myth, you can’t trace any bloodline or anything.
* Everywhere that was “conquered” by “Romans” ... they just killed all the people there, took over the cities and
  temples,
* assimilated whoever was leftover and then claimed their stuff as “Roman”.
* Then, when you trace the Caesars, their ancestry is always something else.
* And then after the so-called “Roman Civilization” started collapsing
* OSTS story is that they had spread out too much and couldn’t maintain their territories
* It’s more like they just ransacked everything and said “hey, you’re Roman now” and the people said, “okay, whatever
  just don’t kill us anymore”...
* then after they are done looting, pillaging, raping and destroying everything in sight, the Romans leave.
* The people pick up he pieces and go about their normal lives again except that they now pay taxes and have to change
  their names to
* “Roman” names in order to have Roman “citizenship”. So it’s like the mafia.
* The soldiers are all Mithras worshippers and hate women, so if you become a citizen you have to switch to a
  patriarchal system
* and only men can do anything important, like own land.
* Then “Roman Civilization” supposedly collapses (even though it never really was) because they stretch themselves to
  thin...
* then “Germany” becomes “Roman” but they call the leaders Kaisers instead of Caesars.

But who were “they” really? Where did “they” come from? Does anybody know? It’s just a multicultural assimilation,
political ideology or something.

## Roman Jesus Narrative

* why would Pilate free the insurrectionary Barabbas feared by the Roman Empire? This really unravels the
  narrative.
* what parts of the NT decrypt into a Zodiac story?
