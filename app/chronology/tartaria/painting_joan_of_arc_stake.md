Even the supporters of the traditional version admit that the
Maid of Orleans began to be called *Joan of Arc* only from the second half of the xvi century. But this
implies that in the duration of *more than a century* the heroine was called something else. The question is, what?
According to our results she was called **Deborah**. Under this name she entered the Book of Judges. Then in view of the
growing interest towards Joan, her other names and nicknames also fell into common use. And later, in the XVII-XVIII cc.
the former name Deborah was gradually extruded from the story of Joan. The fact that Joan and Deborah is the same person
was slowly forgotten. The 'biblical events' were pushed into the past, two thousand six hundred years back! The
following generations of historians began to sincerely perceive Joan of Arc and the biblical Deborah as two different
characters. In our reconstruction Deborah = Joan of Arc lived in the epoch of the Ottoman conquest in the world of the
XV-XVI cc. That is why the original geography of the events connected to her campaigns was much wider than the modern
version.
