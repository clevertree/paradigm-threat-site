## Atlantis Mars Theory: Ruins of Atlantis are at the North Pole of Mars, not Earth!

During the collinear configuration, the 'highest realm' where Humans could actually set foot would be the North Pole of
Mars.
Above that was Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter which were not habitable on the surface.
There may have been a hidden realm of 'heaven' within, but probably nothing safe for humans.
Mars and Mercury formed on the either sides of Earth because Earth was the only solid mass around.
Mars slowly grew into a planet. Humans built Atlantis there because it had the highest energy and was close to 'heaven'.
When the collinear configuration fell apart, Atlantis on the North Pole of Mars was hit by the same Great Deluge as
Earth.
There may have been an Atlantis on Earth as well, but it was only a shadow compared to the one on Mars.
