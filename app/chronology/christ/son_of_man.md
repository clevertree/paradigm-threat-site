Christ never referred to himself as the 'Son of God'. Instead, he said all humans are "God's Children" - which itself dispelled any subtle notion that Christ was distinct from other humans.
When the NT authors talked about the Son of God who was Sent into the World, they were referring to the Sun, of course, which had recently shown up to drive away the old gods (Planets) ending the golden age.

"3 See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears,[a] we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 3 All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.

Christ originally meant the Sun, because this new Sun god 'anointed' all the life on Earth signaling the end of the most grim Dark Ages.

"Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. 2 He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.”

3 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.[a]”

4 “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”

5 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit[b] gives birth to spirit. 7 You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You[c] must be born again.’ 8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”[d]

9 “How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.

10 “You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and do you not understand these things? 11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.[e] 14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,[f] 15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.”[g]

Christ was referring to all humans when he said the 'Son of Man', again not himself. 

Had Christ referred to himself as 'the' Son of God, wouldn't he have been crucified for that reason? Instead, 'Yehuda of Nazareth, King of the Jews' was carved upon the Crucifix. Did he ever claim to be the King of the Jews? Nope, factually speaking Jesus was never recorded as having made either claim. He was simply a threat - like his literary duplicate 'Barrabas'. 

When you become as much of a threat as Christ had become, your enemies *will* lie about you. First the Catholic/Monotheistic church denied Christ's existence for nearly 200 years, refusing to write down his name in any other fashion than the letter 'iota'. Then, after his myth wouldn't go away, the Monotheists slaughtered the original Gnostic/Cathar Polytheistic Christians in 1380 and created the Apostolic Monotheistic Christianity we know today. This is what the enemies of Christianity did for the next 800 years in order to conquer what could not be defeated: *they obliterated it's true history*.
