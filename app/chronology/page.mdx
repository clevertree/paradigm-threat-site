Questioning the 'official' timeline of Earth's history is not a new phenomenon. Since the 16th century historian critics
like
[Jean Hardouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hardouin),
[Robert Baldauf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baldauf),
[Edwin Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Johnson_\(historian\)),
[Wilhelm Kammeyer](http://alternative.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Chronology),
[Heribert Illig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis), and
[Immanuel Velikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Velikovsky)
have accused church chronologists of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire)

(founder of [modern chronology](https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/joseph-justus-scaliger/))
of conspiring to obfuscate historical records before the 13th century C.E. In modern times, state-sponsored historians
like [Anatoly Fomenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Fomenko#Historical_revisionism)
have used [statistical analysis](https://chronologia.org/en/math_impressions/index.html) of published records
from 2200
sources including [Scaliger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger),
[House of Romanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Romanov),

modern human history started less than a thousand years ago:

> **Christ** was born in [The Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_chronology_\(Fomenko\)#Fomenko's_claims) on

In 1952, [Immanuel Velikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Velikovsky) posited that 'ancient' history was
also in need of a [major revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_in_Chaos). He used
[comparative mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_mythology) and ancient literary sources
(especially the Old Testament) to argue that Earth suffered catastrophic close contacts with other planets
(Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, and especially Venus and Mars) in our past. In 1997,
[Wal Thornhill](https://www.velikovsky.info/wal-thornhill/) presented the
[Electric Universe](https://www.electricuniverse.info/)
theory which provided a new foundation in inter-planetary physics that neatly explained why these cataclysms occurred
in the past. In [Saturnian Cosmology](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html), Earth's recorded history is **less than 4 thousand years** since the start
of the [Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age#Other_Golden_Ages).

and [Fomenko's *New Chronology*](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/index.html)
into an accessible sequence of events from the first memory to modern day. As new research comes to light, I plan on
making corrections to this timeline. I'm hoping this project helps others navigate the _dissonance of consensus_, and be
able to access the *unredacted* origin story of our planet and our species. This timeline focuses on the *causality*
between major events (i.e. why one event led to the next), so not all events of world history are listed.


## The length of a Year changes throughout Antiquity

The Earth's Orbit changed over time from the [collinear configuration](https://chipstero7.wordpress.com/) (Golden Age),
to the non-linear configuration dominated by Jupiter (Dark ages), and into it's final orbit in modern times.
With each *jump*, the number of days in a calendar year changed dramatically.

## Timeline synchronization

As a result of the
deliberate [destruction and obfuscation of indigenous cultural worldwide](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/indigenous-resistance-new-colonialism)
by the Holy Roman Empire, we have an array of conflicting dates of common events. Some examples of different dates of
*"Creation"* are:

```
5969 B.C. - Antiochian by Theophilus
5872 B.C. - "dating of the seventy interpreters"
5508 B.C. - Byzantine dating a.k.a. "The Constantinople version"
5493 B.C. - Alexandrian, the Annian era, (also 5472 or 5624)
5515 B.C. - by Theophilus (also 5507)
5500 B.C. - by Hippolytus and Sextus Julius Africanus
5199 B.C. - by Eusebius of Caesarea
4700 B.C. - Samarian
4004 B.C. - Hebraic dating by Usher
3761 B.C. - Judaic
3491 B.C. - by Hieronymus
```

This project's starting point was the [reconstructed timeline](https://saturniancosmology.org/short.htm) of events
by [Jno Cook's](https://jnocook.net/) starting with a creation date
of [4077 B.C](https://saturniancosmology.org/rec.php#rec-c25h)
which is based on
the [Quiche Maya](https://www.ancient.eu/article/414/maya-religion-the-light-that-came-from-beside-the/). His
book [Recovering the Lost World](https://www.amazon.com/Recovering-Lost-World-Jno-Cook/dp/0997237910)
provides a reconstruction of events based on indigenous records which re-interpret Earth's *Origin Story* in the words
of our ancestors who _were alive when it all happened_.

  strong as gravity.

## Cosmic lifecycle

We are taught in school that our Universe began with a
[Big Bang](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/02/opinion/cosmology-crisis-webb-telescope.html),
however every prediction by this popular theory has been
[refuted](https://www.lppfusion.com/science/cosmic-connection/plasma-cosmology/the-growing-case-against-the-big-bang/)
by more available data since the 1990s. And yet, every civilization that remembers the Golden Age described it as having
started with a "big bang" or incredible brightness. Therefore, a *Big Bang* event indicates the moment of *rebirth* in
the lifecycle of each Solar System, rather than in the entire Universe. The lifecycle of our Solar System is as follows:


First, our Sun [converts](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Nuclear_fusion_in_the_Sun)
light gasses to heavy elements which fall to the Sun's interior and combine into a
[proto-planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanet) with lightning scars across the surface (and no life yet)
orbiting the Sun from the *inside*. As it grows in mass, energy from the Sun charges the *proto-planet*, like a
capacitor, forcing it to develop hollow spheres within to contain the energy. This in turn generates a stronger
[magnetic field](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/planetary-magnetic-field) around it.

  This is a [video](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna46725245) from 2012 demonstrating a proto-planet being *born* out of
  our Sun and heading to the outer solar system.
</div>


Next, after a *proto-planet* has become too big and energetic to sustain a stable orbit within a Sun, it forces its way
out and is [violently born](https://video.paradigmthreat.net/w/t8Lknnf8B2t5TTqM7XT4XH?start=8s) out of the Sun's
surface (also known as a [coronal mass ejection](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna46725245)).
As a *proto-planet* rips away from the Sun's surface and forms it's own EM field, 
the positively-charged outer shell of the proto-planet's EM field pushes it away from the Sun's
positive environment, and it falls to the [outer solar system](https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/focus-areas/outer-solar-system/)
where many *unborn* planets can be found.

<PopImage {...require("./saturn/brown_dwarf.jpg?w=384")}
          alt="Proto-Saturn as an L-Type Brown Dwarf"
          className={`${imageStyleRight} [&>img]:rounded-md`}>
  Before the Golden Age began, (Proto-)Saturn was once a Brown Dwarf System floating through our galaxy.
</PopImage>


In order to become a planet, a *proto-planet* must then be consumed by a larger host body and carried back to the Sun.
Proto-Earth was lucky to encounter the *brown dwarf* Proto-Saturn as the dwarf system passed into our Sun's orbit and
connected with it electrically. This was the moment of our planet's *conception* as our Sun's
[current](https://now.uiowa.edu/news/2021/07/physicists-led-university-iowa-more-fully-describe-suns-electric-field)
passed into the Proto-Earth, filling it with heat and energy, and eventually forcing it out of its mother's (Saturn's)
womb via [electromagnetic repulsion](https://www.britannica.com/science/magnetism/Repulsion-or-attraction-between-two-magnetic-dipoles).

Unable to contain the smaller charging bodies within it the plasma Sheath exploded, creating all the gas planets, and
pouring plasma and solid material into the Sun's orbit. This material coalesced and polarized around
[Birkeland currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkeland_current)
forming the moons and rock planets (Mercury and Mars), and forcing all planets into a
[collinear configuration](http://qdl.scs-inc.us/2ndParty/Pages/11007.html) connected at their poles.
This high-energy idyllic period is remembered as the Golden Age for any planet - a time when all forms of life
are created.

The planets continue to grow and eventually the collinear system breaks up into a non-linear 'round-table' system marked
by [epic cataclysms](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/632271) spanning the "Dark Ages" (i.e. Old Testament).
After the instability is resolved, the planets violently break away from each other and eventually find their final
orbits around our Sun. The cataclysms come to an end and modern history begins (i.e. New Testament).

After many thousands of years of stable orbits, each planet loses density and conductivity and drifts towards the outer
solar system, slowly at first, but increasing in speed until it finally [rips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip)
its way out of our solar system and dies, along with all remaining life on it. At this point the Sun's system has
become empty and ready for another cycle to begin.

# Before Creation

Ancient testimony from different civilizations seem to agree that there was no *history* (or time) before the
"creation" event. In all accounts, the time before the Golden Age was a lasting darkness. During this dark period,
Saturn's dwarf system was beginning to receive its first energy from the Sun, and with this energy came the first life
forms capable of having memory. As Saturn had not yet joined the Sun's orbit, there was no way to account for time.


## 3 Plasmoids in the Southern hemisphere

There was another bright source of light which was seen only from the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth before the Golden
Age remembered as [Hurakan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huracan)
in the Central American [Popol Vuh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh)
and other Mesoamerican sources, and [Muspelheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muspelheim) in
[Norse cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_cosmology).

## Spawning of the First Life Forms

The memory of the moment of 'creation' shared by
[different mythologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_creation_myths) were witnessed by life forms
that had *already spawned* and were capable of remembering it and recording it later during the Golden Age.
The [Younger Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda) states:

> And when the heated blasts from Muspelheim met the rime [of the rivers], so that it melted into drops,
> then, by the might of him who sent the heat, the drops quickened into life and took the likeness of a man,
> who got the name Ymer.

Every mythology (including the Bible) states that powerful forces in the sky spawned all life forms (including humans)
after its own image - an image which changed many times. As the Golden Age approached, the 3 southern plasmoids took on
different shapes, generating different animal energy patterns until finally the plasmoids formed the
[First Man](https://www.olivehackney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Year-5-History-and-Reading-Maya-Civilization-Creation-Story-Comprehension-with-Answers.pdf)
pattern. This ideal pattern in the southern sky provided the
[scalar](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00792R000500240008-9.pdf) blueprint for spawning the first
humans.

### Scalar Energy as the basis of Creation

The physics behind [Scalary Energy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/difference-between-scalar-energy-negative-ion-robert-e-chan)
(aka [ZPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy)) can be applied to determine how the original species were
created in a high-energy environment *without* the need for evolution over many generations. Scalar Energy from
large electromagnetic fields causes [quantum fluctuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) on single
points of space within the field. As the plasmoids in the southern sky took on a new energetic shape, quantum
fluctuations of energy upon the Earth forced similar energy patterns to generate within the inert matter (raw material
like metal or clay), and thus bringing the first animal forms to life. These primitive conscious entities, known as
[Golems](https://www.jmberlin.de/en/topic-golem) did not need to eat, see, or move about, in order to survive and thus
had no organs. This early 'Golem' form of life (including humans) then evolved organs throughout the Golden Age
as necessary.

# The Golden Age

  depicting the beginning, middle, and end of the *Golden Age*.
</PopImage>

This period of stable collinear configuration is remembered throughout the civilizations of the Earth as the *Golden
Age*. The Hindu Brahma, Yama, Vishnu, and Manu describe the age of the [“Brilliant
Yima“](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/blog/blog-michael1.txt). To the Chinese, it was the reign of [“Yellow
Emperor” Huang-ti](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/china/huang-di.txt), founder of Taoism. In Northern
Europe, [Peace of Frodi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%B3%C3%B0i). In the Christian Bible, this 930 year
period was the [Garden of Eden](https://bennettleeross.com/history/intruder-alert-a-fast-approaching-brown-dwarf-star/).
In [The Myth of the Golden Age](http://www.ifiseeu.com/misc-ancient-myth/golden-age-myth.htm) 1997, David Talbott
describes Eden:


> "The world was quite other than what it is today: the trees were forever in fruit;
> the animals lived in perfect harmony, and the little Agouti played fearlessly with the beard of the Jaguar."

As each planet was connected [in-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Series_circuits),
their axial tilt would stay synchronized even as the entire system Orbited the Sun, but after the planets left the
configuration, each would connect to the Sun's environment **in parallel**
and their axial tilts would be fixed indefinitely. This is the reason Earth, Mars, Saturn, and Neptune have
matching [axial tilts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Solar_System_bodies) within 3 degrees. By the end of
this period, each planet in the configuration had become a "fully charged" capacitor, unable to accept more charge or
grow larger in size. The configuration violently came to an end, and the age of cataclysm began.

  The discovery that objects from the Neolithic or Early Bronze Age carry patterns associated with high-current

  I deals with the comparison of graphical and radiation data from highcurrent Z-pinches to petroglyphs, geoglyphs,
  and megaliths. Part I focused primarily, but not exclusively, on petroglyphs of some 84 different morphologies:
  pictures found in laboratory experiments and carved on rock. These corresponded to mankind's visual observations of
  ancient aurora as might be produced if the solar wind had increased (T. Gold) at times between one and two orders of
  magnitude, millennia ago. Part II focuses on the source of light and its temporal change from a current-increasing
  Z-pinch or dense-plasma-focus aurora.

As Saturn's body entered
our [positively charged Sun's](http://altcosmology.com/The-Sun-is-Electrically-Positively-Charged.php)
orbit, Saturn became connected to the Sun's electrical environment as
a [negatively charged cathode](https://www.holoscience.com/wp/cassinis-homecoming/).
Saturn's system drew energy from the Sun into itself as
a [super-capacitor](https://www.instructables.com/The-Forever-Rechargeable-VARIABLE-Super-Capacitor-/)
would until it became 'full', at which point the Saturn
system [exploded](http://quantavolution.net/vol_03/chaos_creation_08.htm)
creating the gas planets Jupiter, Venus, Uranus and Neptune.

heavens, a mound of water would have
previously formed at the North Pole due
to Saturn’s gravitational effect (in the
same way that the Moon today affects
tides, but in a stationary way). The
sudden flaring of Saturn would have
disrupted this gravitational pull and
released the mound of water where it
would have spread out destructively over
the northern hemisphere.

### The length of a year was 225 days

In this time Saturn was called [Kronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus), the *God before time began* and Creator
of the Universe (i.e. our solar system). Before clocks and calendars, the positions of the planets and stars were the
only way to tell time. Saturn's system was now orbiting our Sun, and with this apparent motion - time began. Our current
Sun was still hidden behind Saturn (and Jupiter) and was not yet visible to humans. As the spin of the Earth did not
change significantly from antiquity until modern times, so we can regard on the length of a 'day' on Earth as a
constant. In this time the length of a year of orbit around the Sun was 225 days. This orbit was 40%
*faster* than our current orbit of 365.25 days. The changes of the length in the year occur periodically and suddenly in
history as the Earth jumps from one orbit to another, eventually reaching its individual orbit around the Sun. With each
jump, the Earth becomes part of a smaller configuration and draws in less energy from the Sun. This results in a
*slower* orbit.

### Saturn's Collinear Planetary Configuration - The Tree of Life

course through the planets and force them into a new _collinear configuration_, connecting each planet from north to
south pole, like an array of batteries. Here is
a [minimalist video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=20&v=KUbD-vYLPAI&feature=emb_title) depicting part of
the collinear configuration. In ["The Saturn Myth"](https://www.everythingselectric.com/product/the-saturn-myth/) David
Talbott describes:

> Accounts of Saturn’s appearance suggest that the planet hung ominously close to the earth.
> In early ritual and astronomy Saturn appears as the primeval sun, described as a figure of terrifying splendour.
> Today, Saturn appears as a bare speck of light following the same visual path as the solar orb.
> But during the legendary Golden Age, Saturn stood in the north.
> Legends from every continent depict the primeval sun as an immense, fiery globe at the
> north celestial pole - the visual pivot of the heavens. Unlike the rising and setting solar orb,
> the primeval sun remained fixed in one place.

  During the Golden Age, the *Absu* plasma layers of [Proto-Saturn](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html)
  (also known as the [Firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament) in the bible)
  surrounded the Planets.
</PopImage>

### The Absu layers surrounded the Planets

Visible on the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth was "[the Absu](https://saturniancosmology.org/cos.php)", also called
"The Abyss" or [Firmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament) in the Christian Bible. This 'seal' represented multiple outer layers of Saturn's plasma sheath and appeared
to humans as obscuring equatorial rings of a cosmic 'sea' in the southern sky.
[Jno Cook](https://jnocook.net/) describes it:

> "I had no trouble identifying the Sumerian Absu, the Egyptian Duat,
> and the Maya House of Nine Bushes as a set of rings seen in the southern night sky.
> The rings were almost universally, throughout the world, understood to be an
> ocean standing up from the south horizon. By the Talbott / Thornhill model,
> Earth would have existed within the glow level plasma discharge (the coronal envelope)
> of Saturn before the intersection with the Solar System, and within the memory of mankind.
> The stars and other planets might not have been visible, and perhaps not even Saturn would have been seen
> — just the 'waters above'."

### All planets and suns are hollow

The reason for the Absu having multiple layers, as depicted on ancient artifacts, is described in the theory of
[Electromagnetism](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/electromagnetism/electromagnets.html).
In this theory, any object with energy passing through/around it will
[polarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizability),
causing the lines of magnetic flux to appear in layers of different charge. At high amplitude, matter sticks to each
layer eventually forming concentric circles within the body to increasingly capacitate that energy. As a result,
charging a space body (like a planet) with additional energy will cause to grow in size. As a planet grows in size,
the gap between the inner circles expands, causing the planet to become [hollow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfFJiUWuDk).

### Northern Hemisphere Configuration

From anywhere on the northern hemisphere of the Earth, one could look northwards and see in order:
Mars, Venus, then the gas giant Saturn. Behind Saturn was the gas giant Jupiter, which was not yet visible. Behind
Jupiter, at a 26.7 degree angle, was our Sun. All together, they form an
unmistakable [Star and crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_and_crescent) in the sky worshiped throughout the
Persian, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, and throughout Islam today. This deity was known in Egypt as Osiris
the "Triform God", and as "The Trinity" in Babylonian and Abrahamic religion. This crescent was slowly rotating causing
a separation between night and day:

```
Genesis 1:4: And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
```

In [Norse mythology](https://skjalden.com/nine-realms-in-norse-mythology/), each heim ('house') in the configuration was
named so:
Muspelheim (Realm of Fire / Mercury), Alfheim (Bright realm of Elves / Venus), Midgard (Middle Land / Earth),
Jotunheim (Realm of Frost Giants / Mars), Asgard (Realm of the Aesir / Jupiter), Vanaheim (Realm of the Vanir / Saturn),
Svartalfheim (Dark realm of Dwarves / Uranus). Niflheim (Realm of Myst / Neptune), Helheim (Realm of the Dead /
Underworld / Pluto), The Norse also had a name for the Birkeland currents that bridged between worlds:
[The Bifröst](https://norse-mythology.org/cosmology/bifrost/).

Sometimes locations were personified; Mars was Fenrir/Fenris the Wolf and appeared as a spherical planet, while Venus
was the Midgard Dragon / Serpent / [Doomsday Comet](https://www.aeonjournal.com/articles/talbott/talbott.html)
and appeared stretched out in many shapes and colors, none of which resembled a planet. It is during this time that Mars
makes eight *descents* to Earth creating the appearance of Osiris,
the [Triform God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_deity).

  Still there was before a world to the south which was called Muspelheim. It is light and hot, and so bright and
  dazzling that no stranger, who is not a native there, can stand it.
  This means darker-skinned humans who could 'stand the heat' came from high-energy realms like Mars, Mercury, or the
  southern end of the Earth. The fiery apparition of the Squatter Man figure in the south was recorded many times by
  many civilizations as the Phoenix, Burning Man or Wicker Man, and the myth of Quetzalcoatl.
</PopImage>

### Southern Hemisphere Configuration

In 2003, Anthony L. Peratt described ancient testimony
of [3 intense "plasmoids"](http://www.mythsarehistory.com/peratt-column-the.html)
in the southern region of the world. The 3 "plasmoids" were the planets Mercury, Neptune, and Uranus forming the lower
end of the conjunction. While authors like [Jno Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/) suggest the 3 southern plasmoids
of "Peratt's Column" lit up between 10,900 and 8347 B.C.E., before Saturn was connected to our Sun in 4077
B.C.E. [Snorre's Edda](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rutledge/snorra_edda.htm) states:

> Still there was before a world to the south which was called Muspelheim.
> It is light and hot, and so bright and dazzling that no stranger, who is not a native there, can stand it.

This means darker-skinned humans who could 'stand the heat' came from high-energy realms like Mars, Mercury, or the
southern end of the Earth. The fiery apparition of
the [Squatter Man](http://www.theplasmaverse.com/verse/squatterman-plasmadischarges-petroglyphs.html)
figure in the south was recorded many times by many civilizations as
the [Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_\(mythology\)), Burning Man
or [Wicker Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicker_man), and the myth
of [Quetzalcoatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl#Myths).

### Atlantis and the Tree of Knowledge

The planets in the northern configuration create a spectacular **Tree of Life** display which appear directly above the
continent of [Atlantis](https://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=201407156476.the_lost_continent_of_the_arctic), and it's three
major cities Og
and [Aryan](https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/why-the-nazis-were-obsessed-with-finding-the-lost-city-of-atlantis),
and the 'Emerald City' of [Poseida](https://dailymassmeditation.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/3501/). The city of Aryan was
the largest and most populated city. The city of Poseida was the capital of Atlantis and exist at the very center of the
continent appearing as a massive pyramid or ziggurat built out
of [synthetic emeralds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald#Synthetic_emerald). This construction allow for maximized
conductivity of the cosmic currents of energy streaming into it from the planetary configuration. The rulers of this
city considered themselves the 'upper class' of the human race, and jealously guarded all of their inventions and
knowledge until the city itself became known as the **Tree of Knowledge**. After the fall of Atlantis, the upper-class
citizenry of Poseida escape preserving their knowledge (_and class-system_)
in the secret places of the world. This was the beginning of the so-called **Deep State**.

          className={`${imageStyleRight} [&>img]:rounded-md`}>
  The appearance of Priori-Mars as the Cosmic Mountain during the Golden Age was also remembered as *Jacob's Ladder*
</PopImage>

### Priori-Mars as the Ladder / Stairway / Mountain of Heaven

[Annis Pepion Scott](https://www.electric-cosmos.org/ouruniverse.html) describes the _Cosmic Mountain_:

> Might the flowing hair of Venus, or the "fiery dragon" (as that
> planet is depicted in many ancient myths and drawings) actually
> have been the glowing ions of twisting Birkeland currents (or
> "stringy things" as mainstream astronomers call them)? Pictographs

> currents and plasma instabilities such as those Peratt has seen in

> sphere (planet?) is included in pictures of the Chinese dragon.


The hollow planet Mars was much larger than it is today, containing several more outer shells of decreasing density.
Each shell is supported by opposing magnetospheres. During inter-planetary encounters, the outer shell
of [Priori-Mars](http://www.buybooksontheweb.com/peek.aspx?id=7598)
collapsed, and the inner shell would exit the planet's outer surface leaving a long streaking cone shape behind it. The
inner shell would then approach Earth, sometimes causing cataclysm, before retreating and returning completely to it's
spherical shape repeating until Priori-Mars finally loses its outer shell in 686 B.C.E.. This *cosmic mountain* would
be remembered as the *Yggdrasil: The Tree of Life*, *The Tower of Babel*, *Ladder or Stairway to Heaven*, and many other
myths. The cone shape would appear in famous artifacts such as the Egyptian White Crown, the Persian Crown of Mithra.

### Quantum Entanglement

During the Golden Age, there was an over-abundance of high-amplitude, low-voltage energy flowing through each planet in
the configuration which Norse refers to as "The Bifröst". As the planets in this configuration did not spin, each North
and South Pole acted as a strong [quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation) between
planets. Building pyramidal structures upon these locations enabled humans to **travel instantaneously** through the
Bifröst. This may sound _outlandish_, however Egyptian mythology has a symbol for
the ["Boat of Ra"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_barque),
which [transported Ra between each planet](https://www.reddit.com/r/PastSaturnsRings/comments/iwl8we/the_saturn_stargate/)
,
and it looks **a lot** like a modern day depiction of a "wormhole":

### The First Jews of Atlantis (First Jerusalem)

  Atlantis was the first holy city - First Jerusalem - built on the north poles of Mars
  and Earth to harness the energy of the Collinear Configuration and Golden Age
</PopImage>

The term 'Jew' refers to anyone who worships the planet Saturn as a *Creator God* of the Earth (and it's Universe) going
by the names YHWH, Adonai, El, Elohim, Shaddai, Tzevaot, Ehyeh, Ba'al, Elah, El Roi, Elyon, or simply HaShem i.e. "The
name". In history, the term 'Jew' refers to a closed society of people who claim to have *been chosen by* and represent
that same Creator God. The priest class of this closed society (a.k.a. Rabbis, Pharisees, Pharos) seek to execute
_God's_ _Authority_ over all aspects of life - finance, food, procreation, death and afterlife - even over humans
outside their society (i.e. the gentiles). They operate at the highest levels of human society (i.e. deep) and form the
protective outer layer of the so-called **Deep State** throughout history.

Until modern times, Jews managed to avoid intermarrying with non-Jews. By keeping
a [strict](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/safe-bris.page)
separation between their lineage and outsiders, they could pass down their inherited authority over the gentiles to
their ancestors and keep their power structure intact over the centuries. It is for this reason that Jews pop in and out
of the histories of the gentiles, and appear to have no origin or homeland themselves. Therefore, the first time the
Jews appeared in history was in before the fall of Atlantis. In this time and location, the Jews represented a priest
class who would exchange advanced technology as gifts for obedience to their authority and the authority of Saturn, the
Creator God.

In modern times, Abrahamic religions refer to this period in history as the Garden of Eden, and the city of Atlantis as
the [Tree of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil). This story is also
reflected in the 1900 novel [The Wonderful Wizard of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz), and
the [1902 musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_\(1902_musical\)) (both *ground-breaking* successes).

# The Dark Ages

The period of stability that pervaded the Golden Age would suddenly come an end. Each planet had been absorbing matter
and energy from the Sun growing in size throughout the *Golden Age* period. Eventually the planets become too large and
too energetic, and begin to oscillate violently in a new non-linear orbit beginning a long period of instability that
would come to define the *Dark Ages*.

## 3147 B.C.E. The Golden Age Ends Violently.

Within a very short time, all 9 planets (including Earth) break from the configuration and exit the outer layers
of Saturn's protective plasma sheath. The planets, having left Saturn's collinear configuration, violently compete with
each other for a place in a new orbit. They form
an [in-parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits#Parallel_circuits)
circular _non-linear_ configuration that together orbits the Sun for the next 1655 years. Humanity encounters a new
unfamiliar influence - *death* - as it enters a period of extended darkness, famine, pestilence, and confusion.

### The length of a year increases by an additional 15 rotations per year to 240 days total.

The Maya calendar starts with Earth jumping into it's *second orbit* under Jupiter's influence
on [3114 B.C.E.](https://www.aaas.org/myths-mayan-long-count-calendar#:~:text=The%20Long%20Count%20is%20an,6%20in%20the%20Julian%20calendar)
with each year (orbit around the Sun) recorded as 240 days long. This would be the first time humanity got a peak at our
Sun and gas-giant Jupiter, which were hiding behind Saturn until now. This new Sun would prove to be too bright for most
to bare and life on earth escaped into dark caves to avoid it. Occasionally Jupiter would orbit in front of the Sun, and
together they would appear as a radiant throne in the sky.

### The Great Deluge

As Earth and the other planets pass through Saturn's outer plasma sheath (The _Absu_), the layer cools
into [sodium-salt water](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20090624.html)
becoming heavy and crashing into the planet surface causing the first **great deluge**
by [each civilization](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Great_Flood). Earth receives its salty oceans from
Saturn, which is why the Atlantic ocean is also called [Sea of Kronos](https://atlantipedia.ie/samples/sea-of-kronos/).
In modern times, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cannot legitimately answer the question:
[Why is the ocean salty, but rivers flowing into it are not?](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/riversnotsalty.html)

### Humanity was then cast out of the Garden of Eden

From humanity's perspective, they couldn't contemplate why their _creator_ (planet Saturn)
had tossed them out of its Garden (the collinear configuration)
changing their world for the worse. They search for answers to simple questions:
_Why don't the trees produce fruit anymore? Why can't women have babies anymore? Why are the animals eating each other?_

Finding no simple answers, the priests of the fallen Atlantis offers their fellow survivors on Earth a rather ominous
explanation:
__The creator (Saturn) was punishing its creation (humanity) for our choice to seek forbidden knowledge__. This lie
functions to coalesce some humans under the influence of the **Deep State**. Humans were then ordered to erect graven
images of the "Bull of Heaven"
and sacrifice the weakest of the brood to it, in order to convince the fictional
deity [Moloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch)
to restore the "Golden Age". The _Human Sacrifice_ became a central policy of the **Deep State**
as families were ordered
to [conscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_ancient_Egypt#Old_and_Middle_Kingdom_armies) their children
into war,
[re-educate](http://www.legendsandchronicles.com/ancient-civilizations/ancient-egypt/ancient-egyptian-education/) them,
or sell them into [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Egypt#Bonded_laborers).

### Formation of the Deep State Pyramidal Empire

The second time Jews appeared was in the Egyptian Pyramidal Empire.
As [Sigmund Freud](https://academic.oup.com/fordham-scholarship-online/book/21978/chapter-abstract/182031483) (and
others) pointed out, the *Jews of the Exodus* were the upper class, *not the slave class*. During the dark ages, the
priest class ordered Pyramids built across the Earth forming a New Atlantis under God's Authority.

However, no amount of human sacrifice or idol worship would stop what was coming next. Detatched from the collinear
configuration, each planet became subject to the influences of the Brown Dwarf Saturn. From Earth, humans watch as the
other planets violently flip polarity and fall into the gaping mouth of Saturn.
[Roman Mythology](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/1099/simon-hurtrelle-saturn-devouring-one-of-his-children-french-about-1700/)
describes the [Titan Cronus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus), seeing his rule threatened by his own children,
begins to devour each until Jupiter (Zeus) intervenes.

  The Cosmic Thunderbolt was a series of electric discharges between Jupiter and other planetary bodies
</PopImage>

## 3067 B.C.E. The Planets are at war.

With each violent interplanetary action, the Brown Dwarf Saturn continues to lose it's influence over the other
planets. Jupiter hurtles violent plasma discharges seen from Earth which strike Saturn. This exchange was
the [Cosmic Thunderbolt](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2017/01/22/eu2017-the-cosmic-thunderbolt/)
which brought the planets into electrical balance within a new _nonlinear_ configuration. Jupiter's assault upon Saturn
forces the latter to once again shift polarity and eject all consumed planets. This ends Saturn's influence and begins
the reign of Jupiter. Saturn begins a journey into its final orbit in the outer solar system. The new nonlinear "Round
Table" configuration dominated by "King" Jupiter kept the planets (knights) close together in a circular mini-orbit
which altogether orbits the Sun. This new configuration would be remembered in the Arthurian Legend
of [Camelot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot)
along with the period of peace that followed.

The recently discharged Absu layers of Saturn still surround the non-linear configuration. The planets within endure
violent cataclysm as they vie for a position within the configuration. Icelandic Epos present the battle of Mars and
Venus as a fight between the wolf Fenris and the serpent Midgard. Mars again appeares as a hard sphere, but Venus
appeares as a comet with long disheveled hair. Scandinavians recall
the [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros)
or Weltumspanner, as it “Stretched-a-round-the-Earth” and ate its own tail. Mars competes with Earth's orbit and is seen
visiting Earth as [Horus](https://www.ancient.eu/Horus/)
10 times over the next 300 years.

## 2860 B.C.E. All planets enter a stable non-linear orbit.

Jupiter's benevolent reign was a model of the ['Good King'](https://www.aeonjournal.com/articles/talbott/talbott.html)
that inspired the religions of many human nations for ages to come. Festivals around the
world [celebrate](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/festivals-dead-around-world-180953160/)
the death, resurrection, and intervention of Jupiter:
"All Saints Day" and "All Souls Day", Halloween, and "Day of the Dead" in Mexico. In Greek legend, Zeus (
Jupiter) [punishes Prometheus](http://www.firmament-chaos.com/comparative_mythology.html)
(Mars) after he provides Earth with the gift of Fire. This "punishment" was Mars was being hit by Jupiter's thunderbolts
once per orbit, causing the "liver scar"
of [Valles Marineris](https://mars.nasa.gov/gallery/atlas/valles-marineris.html). To the founders of Mosaic law, Jupiter
was the Monotheistic God upon Mount Sinai who
delivered [613 commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments). The greek story of Prometheus would later
be re-written as the "Son of a Monotheistic God"
Jesus Christ, or [the "New Moses"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_comparative_mythology).

C.S. Lewis's "[The Chronicles of Narnia](http://www.mythsoc.org/reviews/planet-narnia.htm)"
featured an evil witch (Venus) who is intervened upon by a resurrected Lion (Jupiter). Each Narnia book secretly
represented a planet. Jupiter: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Mars: Prince Caspian. Sol: The Voyage of the “Dawn
Treader“. Luna (our Moon): The Silver Chair. Mercury: The Horse and his Boy. Venus: The Magician’s Nephew. Saturn: The
Last Battle.

### Jupiter replaces Saturn as the new Saviour (aka Zeus, Thor, King Arthur)

Resolving the electric imbalances between the planets, Jupiter became
[King of the planets](http://www.empirerome.com/wordpress/?page_id=708)
in [Roman Pantheon](https://frostydrew.org/publications.dc/show/entry-611/)
and reigned over a 511-year period of stability. King Jupiter sat upon the Cosmic Mountain, also remembered by different
populations as Mount Olympus, Mount Parnassus, Mount Sinai, and others. This appearance of a 'cosmic mountain' was
actually Jupiter's south pole plasma outpouring extended out into a massive coma tail. Once per orbit, Jupiter would
eclipse the Sun, and the King would wear the Sun's Corona as a Crown.
[Pre-Galfridian Arthurian legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur#Pre-Galfridian_traditions)
describes King Arthur (Jupiter) orbiting a 'round table' along with the greatest knight of all - Lancelot (Mars), and
the lesser knights. Together, the _Knights of the Round Table_ defended Briton from fire-monsters (The Sun), as well as
dragons and witches (Venus). During this period, the nonlinear orbit between planets grew larger and more unstable
resulting in the
inevitable [Breaking of the Round Table.](https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu/2015/08/king-arthur-and-his-part-in-the-breaking-of-the-round-table/)

### Pyramids are Portals

During this time, it was again possible for humans to exploit powerful natural Birkeland Currents coursing between the
planets in Jupiter's orbit. Humans on each planet uncover natural electromagnetic ley lines and built Pyramids upon
those locations. With the help of human giants, civilizations build all pyramids in Egypt, Mesopotamia, England, China,
and in South America Andes in less than 200 years. This "Artificial Bifröst" quantum entanglement facility made it once
again possible for humans to travel between the planets.
**All pyramids
are [man-made quantum tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/PastSaturnsRings/comments/iwl8we/the_saturn_stargate/)**
built at locations of concentrated cosmic energy (entanglements) between planets.

The last Absu layer surrounding the remaining planets becomes stressed as the nonlinear orbit becomes too wide to
support it. The configuration becomes unstable once again. Jupiter's coma-tail throne diminishes causing the gas giant
to pass through the Absu layer and disappear. The Sun turns red and vanishes. Absent the influence of Jupiter, and with
the Absu (heavens) sealed shut, _Mars and Venus go to war_. Gas planet Venus appears disheveled as she "_laments_" at
the death of the King Jupiter. She becomes **The Dragon** and lashes out at Earth and Mars with her plasma tendrils. The
violent exchange between Earth and Venus **parts the sea** forcing open the aerial Absu layer and **turning the sea
red**, which bled across the sky for three days until only one Absu ring remained.
**This was the most terrifying moment in human history**. In [Recovering the Lost World](https://saturniancosmology.org)
Jno Cook writes:


> Sodom and Gomorrah suffered their initial destruction in the collapse of buildings at this time (which were rebuilt).
> Some regions of Earth would have been absolutely devastated, as Claude Schaeffer has pointed out. But it was the '
> blood' seen in the 'ocean [in the sky]' which would have convinced the rest of the world that indeed millions of

As the Absu collapsed, the Earth was inundated with a Second Flood of epic proportions. The Christian Bible remembers
this event as Noah's Ark, but the real subtext for this event was
[the wholesale slaughter of humanity](https://www.saturniancosmology.org/syn.php). All civilizations across Earth recall
this destructive contact with the Raging Goddess, Witch (with broom), Dragon, or Comet. Venus was associated with
Hathor, Sekhmet, and Anath in Egypt, Tiamat in Mesopotamian, Kali in Hinduism,
and [Medusa](http://www.ifiseeu.com/venus-mars-myth/terrifying-glory.htm) in Greek Mythology. In the epic poem Beowulf,
Grendel (Venus) has his arm torn off "at the shoulder" symbolizing the severing of the plasma connection between Venus
and Saturn (Grendel's Mom).

### The length of a year increases by 20 rotations to 260 days.

The cataclysmic contact with Venus ends as "_Messiah_" Jupiter re-appears through the fading Absu. Jupiter, apparently
risen from the dead after 2.5 days, once again appears upon it's coma-tail mountain (or throne). This "resurrection"
seemed to have the affect of calming the destructive rage of Venus, and She returns to spherical form. Earth's orbit
around Jupiter changes slightly resulting in a _260 day year_ and Earth manages to **capture The Moon**, which becomes
visible for the first time. With the Absu significantly reduced, stars were also visible in the southern hemisphere for
the first time.

## 2193 B.C.E. Earth leaves last Absu layer and Jupiter consumes Venus again

This new period of stability lasts another 156 years and ends abruptly when the nonlinear configuration loses its last
Absu layer. Exposed to the Sun's electromagnetic field, each planet forms its
own [magnetosphere](http://www.plasmacosmology.net/tech.html). Seasons begin on Earth for the first time. The formations
of deserts during this period force the populations of Western Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and North Africa to
migrate. The Egyptian and [Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) kingdoms collapse. The Earth is
still in the nonlinear orbit with Jupiter, and the year extends to 273 days. It would be another 200 years before Egypt
re-populates beginning the [Middle Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt) period. As Venus
becomes exposed to the Sun's field, it retreats into the safety of Jupiter's magnetosphere, and becomes once again
_consumed into the Gas Giant's interior_.

### The length of a year increases by 13 rotations to 273 days.

At the same time, northern populations of the Earth experienced an ice-age lasting well over 200 years.
In [Egyptian Myth and Catastrophism](http://firmament-chaos.com/papers/EgyptianarticleV2.pdf) Robert Ackerman explains:

> It is of interest that mythologies of countries where the fiery-dragon (proto-Venus)
> cannot be correlated with heat or drought, such as the Norse, preserve it as a representative of winter.
> This can be explained in the catastrophism scenario by the fact that during the Vedic Period, Proto-Venus,

> from the equator than when priori-Mars orbited the Earth.

## 2167 B.C.E. Jupiter catches on fire

Within 25 years, Gas-Giant Jupiter, still appearing on it's coma-tail mountain, and having recently consumed Venus,
becomes fully exposed to the Sun's field and catches on fire for 20 straight years. Humans world-wide remembered this
epic spectacle as
[The Burning Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_bush) (Mosaic) or
[Chilam Balam](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/maya/cbc/cbc15.htm) (Mayan)
and many others, even the Grateful Dead song [Fire On The Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pOKqcaR-A0). The
Old Testament story of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses)
redacts the planet saviour Jupiter (Zeus) into a mythical human prophet "Mo-Zeus" i.e. Moses who represents
a '[Universal Creator and Saviour God](https://sites.google.com/a/kent.edu/jwattles/home/comparative-religious-thought/judaism/moses-concept-of-god)'
. Under the changing influence of the gas giant, the Earth itself undergoes further cataclysm. In Hebrew and Egyptian
tradition, the Burning Bush was a sign that God (Jupiter) was unhappy with His creation (
Humanity). The Earth groaned, the ground vibrated, and a trumpeting sound was heard and _felt_ by every creature on the
planet up to [613](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/613_commandments) times. Humans interpreted each exultation as a new
Commandment spoken directly by God. This became the basis of the 10 Commandments of
the [Mosaic Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_covenant).

</PopImage>
This event symbolizes the end of King Jupiter reign as well as a changing of the 'rules'. To most humans, Jupiter's epic
display meant once again that the _powers that be_ did not represent any gods. The **Deep State** reacts to this new
reality by creating the [Abrahamic Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_of_the_pieces)
replacing their direct rulership with indirect religious mind-control. In Genesis 22, the Bible story of
the [Binding of Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac)
describes the new rules of the Covenant. Abraham was originally called Abram which has the word 'Ram' in it. In this Old
Testament narrative, God orders Abram to sacrifice his son Isaac as a test of loyalty. Abram complies and goes through
with the sacrifice until he is stopped by emissaries of the age of Aries (the Ram). These emissaries inform Abram that
he may slaughter a ram instead of his child, and he then does so under this new covenant. Going forward, subjects would
be ordered to sacrifice animals to show their loyalty to the **Deep State** and to it's invisible god.

## 1936 B.C.E. Sodom and Gomorrah completely destroyed by Mars.

With Jupiter's influence in decline and Venus absent, the nonlinear configuration continues to widen and destabilize.
The periodic cataclysmic encounters between Earth and Mars increase in duration and intensity. Eventually an alignment
between the planets Mars, Earth, and Mercury causes the complete destruction of the five _cities of the plain_ named in
Genesis 14:2:
**Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim and Zoar**. Flaming sulfur from Mars fell to Earth as a miles-wide column of electric
discharge decimated the plain.

The [1611 KJV Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version) would later redact this famous natural cataclysm
into a story of human sin and divine retribution with homosexuality as the scapegoat justifying the retribution.
Nevertheless, some aspects of the story are true. Instant fossilization can occur during periods of interplanetary
discharge.

  Exodus from the Pyramidal Empire
</PopImage>

## 1492 B.C.E. The "Passover" of Comet Venus and Exodus from the Pyramidal Empire

In the last 675 years, gas-giant Jupiter has been directly exposed to the Sun's field drawing energy into it and growing
larger. This eventually results in Jupiter flipping polarity and ejecting the consumed gas planet Venus. On April 19,
1492 B.C. Jupiter unexpectedly **expels Venus** as a massive Comet that **passes over** Earth's sky and heads towards
the Sun. The passage of Venus in proximity to the earth results in further _plagues_. Seeing the approach of
this "**angel of death**", the terrified population makes [ram sacrifices](https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-16.htm)
and splashes the blood on the sides of their houses. Jno
Cook [describes the event](https://www.saturniancosmology.org/syn.php):

> "Venus again made an electric contact with Earth, causing a crushing repulsive blow in the east Central Pacific.
> The Pacific islands were wiped clean of any trace of humans, except for the petroglyphs carved on every island
> thousands of years earlier.
> Coastal South America and Central America were inundated with water, leaving sea-water traces in lakes high up in the
> Andes,
> and possibly causing a sudden rise in the coastal range of the Andes by thousands of feet.
> The blow was followed by an electric arc traveling through the Pacific, the Indian Ocean,
> and part of India -- following a path of increasingly higher latitude into the Mediterranean
> as the Earth's axis angled back toward the Sun.
> The event is recalled in mythology as the attack of the monster Typhon who is struck down by Zeus.
> The major result of the contact was a 30 percent increase in the orbit of the Earth --
> the year went from 273 days to 360 days.'"

### The length of a year jumps by 92 rotations to 365 days

Based on the increase in the number of days (+92) in a year, we can ascertain that Earth has finally left Jupiter's
orbit and is on an independent orbit around the Sun. The _newly independent_ inner planets begin to form final
electro-magnetic fields. Full exposure to the Sun causes the Earth to become covered in a obscuring clouds and a plague
of darkness lasting 20 years.
In [Worlds in Collision](https://books.google.com/books?id=FJst27kSVBgC&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=When+Venus+sprang+out+of+Jupiter+as+a+comet)
, Immanuel Velikovsky describes other plagues like frogs and locusts:

> "When Venus sprang out of Jupiter as a comet and flew very close to the earth, it became
> entangled in the embrace of the earth. The internal heat developed by the earth and the scorching
> gases of the comet were in themselves sufficient to make the vermin of the earth propagate at a
> very feverish rate. Some of the plagues, like the plague of the frogs ("the land brought forth
> frogs") or of the locusts, must be ascribed to such causes. Anyone who has experienced a
> khamsin (sirocco), an electrically charged wind blowing from the desert,
> knows how, during the few days that the wind blows, the ground around the villages begins to
> teem with vermin."

</PopImage>


### Venus replaces Jupiter as the new Saviour (aka Joshua / Lucifer)

With the departure of the planets from the nonlinear orbit dominated by Jupiter, the pyramids would no longer function
as quantum gateways. The Pyramidal Empire loses the ability to communicate between locations and _simulate deities_
within the pyramidal chambers. People quickly lose faith in stone idols deities as the idols fall permanently silent.
This event perpetually proved that the **Deep State** did not speak for any gods, visible or invisible. All systems of
control rapidly fall apart and the Pyramidal Empire finally comes to an end. Without servants, the many hundreds of
massive pyramids across the Earth became uninhabitable and are abandoned. Those humans who traveled to and from other
planets like Mars would become stranded in those locations. Stranded on Mars, the human break-away society turned its
focus towards survival and away from systemic control of Earth. It would be many hundreds of years before Martian
influence would be felt on Earth again.

</PopImage>

The significance of the Exodus Event is not the moving of a population, but the 'exodus' from a slave empire into
freedom. For loyal subjects of the Pyramidal Empire, this event was similar to the fall of Atlantis; the **Deep State**
would once again have an _exodus_ from its position of direct ruler-ship as it re-branded itself and buried 'deep'
within the various power structures of society, as well as hidden places of the Earth and other planets. The visible
creator god "Ra" would become _invisible_, and be renamed "[Amun-Ra](https://www.ancient.eu/amun/)", meaning "the hidden
one", "invisible", and "mysterious of form". Amun-Ra would then be elevated from creator of the Solar System into
Creator of the Universe; the "Lord of All". Faith in the existence of this newly refashioned _invisible creator god_
would become the fundamental test of loyalty for all subjects of the **Deep State**, but such a faith would otherwise
become scarce until modern times. As a result, the **Jews** would once again disappear from history until their
appearance in the "greek" Rus-Horde Empire, and its vassal states in the 15th century. The freed slave populations
remained in the regions abandoned by the Deep State and enjoyed a lasting period of peace as they developed indigenous
ceremonies to maintain the memory of the divine intervention that freed them from bondage. To this day,
many [non-jewish](https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/opinion/170393/)
populations especially in Africa remember and celebrate the 'Passover' of Comet Venus.

## 1442 B.C.E. The sun stands still for Joshua

For another 50 years, the planet Venus appears as a Comet in Earth's sky, until it too becomes 'fully charged' by the
Sun's energy, causing a violent flip in its polarity. This state transition which functions similarly
to [atomic electron transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_electron_transition)
would force Venus into a nose-dive towards its final orbit around the Sun. During this transition, the Earth is subject
to an incredibly strong _tilt_ in the Sun's magnetic current flow, which passes from pole to pole through the planet.
This temporary tilt resulted in the appearance of the *Sun reversing it's motion in the sky*, as recorded
in [Joshua 10-13](http://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/JOSH+10.html#:~:text=On%20the%20day%20the).
In [Worlds in Collision](https://books.google.com/books?id=FJst27kSVBgC&pg=PA376&lpg=PA376&dq=The+physical+effects+of+retardation+or+reversal+of+the+earth)
Velikovsky explains how this might work:

In the Biblical Narrative, Moses (Gas-Giant Jupiter) had a successor named Joshua (Planet Venus). With the "Death" of
Moses, Joshua leads the fictional Israelites to Palestine. Joshua needs a decisive victory over the
fictional [5 kings of Makkedah](https://rpmdaily.net/blog/the-5-kings-of-makkedah-5-in-the-series#:~:text=five%20kings).
To accomplish this, Joshua speaks to an invisible "LORD" and requests his intervention in battle.
[Joshua 10](https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-13.htm) of the KJV Bible states:

> The day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the LORD in the presence of Israel:
> “O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”
> And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.
> Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down
> about a whole day.
> There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man, because the LORD fought
> for Israel


The Sun's proxmity to Venus calms the dragon's rage as the gas planet transforms back into spherical shape. The orbits
of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter are now becoming stable around the Sun. The memory of planet Venus as the
Dragon or Comet [fades into myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dragons_in_mythology_and_folklore). As expected,
this story of natural cataclysm is then redacted into an epic fiction of _divine intervention_ in order to serve the
purposes of the **Deep State**. However, to normal folk this event symbolizes something else entirely; the *end* of
cataclysm; the Pantheon of Gods taking their leave to be replaced by the one "Lord", our Sun. As they became no
longer visible, humanity would forget the planets
and [polytheism would go into decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Greco-Roman_polytheism). A great
confusion would begin over the nature of Gods.
[Velikovsky states](https://books.google.com/books?id=FJst27kSVBgC&pg=PA299):

> With Macrobius in the fourth Christian century, there begins a tendency to see in many gods of
> Egyptian and Greek antiquity the personification of the sun. Macrobius compared Osiris to the
> sun, and Isis to the moon, disregarding the opinion of earlier authors. He also interpreted Jupiter
> as the sun.
> As the role the planets played in the history of the world retreated ever further into oblivion, the
> interpretation of nature myths as referring to the sun or the moon became more and more
> widespread.

## 806 to 687 B.C.E. Mars, Earth and Mercury finalize orbits.

Although the orbits of Earth and Mars were apparently stable, the magnetospheres of each planet would occasionally
overlap the orbits. As planets came into proximity, large-scale electric discharge would occur between them increasing
the orbital gap and further altering their orbital periods. With each encounter, calendars would have to be adjusted to
accommodate for the change in the length of a year. Over the next 119 years, Earth would experience 9 encounters with
Mars resulting in planet-wide lightning storms. During these deadly storms, the Earth's surface acted as
a [cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode)
absorbing a constant stream of energy from the anodal surface of Mars. Electric current flowed through Earth making
caves unreliable sanctuaries. This prompted humans to learn how to harness electricity in a bid to survive the storms.

Contemplating the nature
of [electromagnetic induction](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/electromagnetism/electromagnetic-induction.html),
humans built the first cathedrals and minarets. This hollow spire design
routed [electric current](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/basic_concepts/current/what-is-electrical-current.php)
around the structure preventing heat to build into electrostatic discharge thus protecting its inhabitants.
_All cathederals originally provided sanctuary from interplanetary lightning storms._
The rapid onset of technological invention provided by Mars would be remembered in the myth of Prometheus.
[Ackerman](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/ackerman/ackerman-mythology_greek.html#prometheus)
describes the Greek myth:


> Prometheus [was punished] for thwarting the initial effort of Zeus
> to [introduce Pandora](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pandora-Greek-mythology)
> into the world and for his role in instructing
> mortals in the use of fire, thereby aiding in the development
> of civilization, which the gods generally discouraged. Prometheus
> was bound to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains with unbreakable
> chains, where a vulture tore at his flesh all day, with no rest,
> no sleep and no respite.

</PopImage>

### Mars (aka Prometheus) replaces Venus as the new Saviour

In the [Greek narrative](https://www.ancient.eu/Prometheus/), Prometheus (Mars) thwarted Zeus's plan by forcing humans
to invent technology too early.
[Pandora's Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box#Difficulties_of_interpretation)
is metaphor for the **Deep State** plan to _rule earth through evil_, or more specifically through the strategic release
of suppressed technology, usury practice, religious mind control, greed, envy, hatred, pain, disease, hunger, poverty,
war, and death. The electric encounters with Mars quickly teach humans how to harness electricity, as well as generate
their own. In the 7th century B.C.E., humanity enjoys a lasting period of free energy, ideal health, and no Deep
State influence as [magnificent cities](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-best-ancient-cities/index.html)
blossom across the planet. The conflict between Mars and Jupiter showed yet again that the Deep State did not
represent their influence. The plan to rule humanity through evil would have to be stashed back in Pandora's Box to be
released at a later date.

Humanity knew this gift had come at a cost. With each encounter, the outer shell
of [Priori-Mars](https://cycliccatastrophism.org/2010/01/16/the-origin-of-avatar/)
collapsed making the inner shell temporarily visible. The [lightning scars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRV1e5_tB6Y)
streaking across the surface of the inner shell of Mars lead humans to believe Prometheus is being punished for his gift
to humanity. Nine times they watch as his 'flesh' was torn apart and sown back together only to be torn apart again
later. On February 27 747 B.C.E., Mars bumps Earth's magnetosphere and once again alters the Earth's orbital duration.
Calendar keepers introduce a [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) (every 4 years) to account for the new
6-hour offset.

## 686 B.C.E. March 23 - Priori-Mars loses its outer shell - Iron Age Begins

On the 9th close encounter with Earth,
[Priori-Mars](https://cycliccatastrophism.org/2017/11/19/castle-deep-in-lake-van/)
finally grows unstable enough to lose it's outer shell forever. The centuries of interplanetary electric discharged had
converted the light elements in the outer shell into heavy iron, and now the shell was too heavy to retain.
[Ackerman](https://saturniancosmology.org/files/ackerman/ackerman-mythology_greek.html#prometheus)
explains the break-up:

> Its release was influenced by the tidal force of
> proto-Venus, when the latter's inferior conjunctions corresponded to
> its aphelions. At these times the solid core of priori-Mars exited
> the planet and swooped into a lower orbit around the Earth while the
> outer shell drifted away. The two recombined as they left the
> vicinity of the Earth and reformed during the fifteen years that it
> orbited the Sun. After the *final* encounter,
> the outer shell of priori-Mars failed to recombine with its solid
> core and slid out to its current orbit, forming the low density
> planet we now call Mars.

The iron shell of Mars permanently comes apart forming
the [asteroid belt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCOTNboQqV8&feature=emb_title) and
scattering [star metal](https://conananimated.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Metal) across the Earth's surface. This event
kick-starts the [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age)
as humanity receives one more parting gift of **metallurgy** from Prometheus before Mars vanishes forever into it's
final orbit - appearing as a red speck in the night sky. On June 15 685 B.C.E., absent of the extended magnetosphere of
Priori-Mars, Mercury (known as [Phaethon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Phaethon-Greek-mythology))
and Venus both catch on fire. On July 9th, Jupiter catches on fire. 5 days later on July 14th, Jupiter releases a
plasmoid bolt which travels for 11 days and strikes the Sun on the 25th. This event was remembered throughout
Mesoamerica as the [Death of Quetzalcoatl](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/ReadingQuetzalcoatl.html). The
planets were striking their final electromagnetic balance and fixing their orbits that we know today.

## 684 to 670 B.C.E. Solar System becomes stable

By 670 B.C.E., the Earth's orbit becomes circular and the period of *creation* that formed the planets of our Solar
System comes to an end. Earth's new orbit and season schedule would be pleasantly predictable. In religious texts, the
*one* God (our Sun) *drives out the many* (other planets) to rule over a new age. Once again, Deep State Monotheism
would lose ground with the general populations as no priest could have predicted this event. Free of their control, the
general population forms [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism#Persian_origins_or_influences) around the
concept of **knowing** - in contrast with the *encrypted secrecy* of Deep State religions. The gnostic evangelists would
be known for spreading the [Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_gospel) meaning **"good news"**. What was the good
news? The new Sun God was of a very different nature from the old Creator God Saturn. The Sun provides endless abundance
without asking for anything in return. The Sun reveals dark places and old secrets. The Sun would never die. The
good news was that from now on - the world would remain free - as nobody could claim the authority of the Sun!

### The length of a year jumps by 1/4th of. a rotation to 365.25 days

The *year's length* would no longer undergo significant changes as Earth's orbital period
would remain constant in the future. This allowed for the formation of the first
[fixed lunisolar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar).
One problem to solve in the *fixed* calendar is how to count the number of years 'since *creation*'. As the
length of the year changed many times, date ranges that span events during *creation* are inherently _inconsistent_.
Therefore, the solution to this problem is to assign a label to each date indicating whether the year occurred *before*
the Common Era **(B.C.E.)**, or *afterwards* during the Common Era **(C.E.)**.

  Fixed Lunar Calendar
</PopImage>

### How many Lunar Months are in a Year?

1 month was the period of 28 days of the Moon's orbit around the Earth, and back then there were *13 months* of 28
days in a year with the addition of one leap day. Over time, the period of Earth's orbit around the Sun changed
slightly, causing less than 13 lunar months to occur 63 years per century. This caused a conflict in religious ceremony
where some holidays would be skipped on some years, leading to the number 13 being
considered [unlucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_\(number\)#Bad).

The Deep State, which was seeking to control this
new Astrological religion, took advantage of the calendar conflict by inventing the Zodiac and 12 month
Roman/Julian/Gregorian Calendar. This gave the Deep State churches authority over religious ceremony, farming, and even
warfare. The Deep State leveraged their new Zodiac religion as a buffer between the old testament secrets they wished to
keep, and the religious texts propagated to the masses. The life stories they published in the modern bible about the
*resurrected Jesus Christ* are all redactions of
[stories](https://solarmythology.com/lessons/christ2002.htm) based on the Sun and seasons on a 12-month calendar.
Similarly, the stories published in the OT about King David
are [also redactions](https://www.usbible.com/Astrology/stars_of_david.htm) based on the 12 Zodiac signs.

# The Blip: 7th Century B.C.E. to 10th Century C.E. Never Occurred

B.C.E. 670, Year Zero, and CE 1053 are actually the same year. After the cataclysms ended, the Deep State jealousy
guarded records in *holy* church vaults, forbidding outsiders from viewing them. As the old *gods* and stories were
forgotten or fell into myth, it became easier for the Deep State to falsify the timeline. As a result of the success of
the Anno Domini Calendar conspiracy, humans today
(including [catastrophist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) authors
like [Immanuel Velikovsky](https://www.velikovsky.info/) and [Jno Cook](https://saturniancosmology.org/))
believe the events of *creation* ended over 2700 years ago.

In the model of catastrophism the date of the *end of ancient history* is the same date as the
last cataclysmic event - 670 B.C.E when the final orbit of 365.25 days was reached, and the same date as
the *beginning of modern history* - 1053 C.E.. In other words, the age of cataclysm
**ended just under 1000 years ago**.

## Building the New Chronology

The roughly 1700-year period alleged to have existed between end of cataclysm date of 684 B.C.E. and the beginning human
history in the 11th century C.E. **is a complete fabrication** by agents of the *Holy Roman[ov] Empire*. How was this
determined? Between the 16th century and 19th centuries, various authors have written on
the [considerable contradictions](https://chronologia.org/en/history.html)
in Scaliger Chronology, notably
De Arcilla,
Isaac Newton,
Jean Hardouin,
Petr Nikiforovich Krekshin,
Robert Baldauf,
Edwin Johnson,
Nicolay Alexandrovich Morozov,
and Wilhelm Kammeyer.
In the first half of the 19th century, Catastrophist N.A. Morozov stated unequivocally that Scaligerian history should
be subject to complete revision and published his main works on ancient history in 1907-1932. Between 1945 and 1973
the *historical science* community ridiculed his ideas and censored his works. All discussion of Catastrophism, redacted
history, or flaws within Scaligarian history ended during this time. The only exception was Immanuel Velikovsky, who
happened to agree that there were no flaws in Scaligarian version of modern history.

> “He is considered to be the founder of the "critical school" in chronology, but what he really did was try to protect

In 1972 American astrophysicist Robert Newton published an article where he described a strange leap in lunar
acceleration, and the so-called parameter D. In 1973, A. T. Fomenko working as a faculty member of the Department of
Mathematics and Mechanics of the Moscow State University noticed the article and began researching several problems
related to moon physics. In 1980, he published his work on redacted eclipse dating - leading to the question - If Lunar
Dating has been redacted in ancient history, what else has been redacted from history? In 1981, others join
the [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html) project:

> “It became obvious that the complexity of this issue demanded the development of new independent methods of dating.
> Hence the main focus in 1973-1980 was on developing methods of analyzing historical texts that were based on
> mathematical statistics, a number of which was proposed and formulated by A. T. Fomenko in 1975-1979. They allowed for
> the elucidation of the global picture of chronological misdatings in Scaliger's version and elimination. More
> specifically, A. T. Fomenko had discovered three important chronological shifts, of roughly 333 years, 1053, and 1800
> years respectively. These shifts are only inherent to the erroneous chronology of Scaliger-Petavius, and have nothing
> to do with the correct one. It turned out that "the Scaligerian textbook" was compiled from four copies of one and the
> same brief chronicle.[Source](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html)

As scrupulous as the work was, it was still not possible for the historical science community at large to acknowledge
the possibility that Scaligarian chronology could be in any way flawed, and Fomenko's work fell into obscurity. In
this we once again see the enduring influence of the **Deep State**:

> “Today we are being convinced that everything had happened "automatically" and that N. A. Morozov's research was of

# 11th Century C.E. Common Era Begins

With an end to the *age of cataclysm*, the Earth bloomed with life. Plants and animals multiplied in abundance.
Predictable seasons and weather patterns prompted trade routes to be established between cities. The red rings of the
Absu begin to fade revealing a clear sky. The old Gods have departed to become planetary specks in the night sky,
replaced by the *new Saviour*, our Sun.
The *[rainbow](https://www.forthowardcc.com/blog/post/the-rainbow-covenant-)*
would become a common phenomenon signifying the promise of *no more creation*:

## 'Year of our Lord' Deception - 1053 Year Shift forward

With the start of the Common Era, chronologists would write the phrase
[In the year of our Lord](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in%20the%20year%20of%20our%20Lord) before
each date. This meant a date which was occurring in C.E. times after the Lord (our Sun) appeared and after the start of
the *fixed* calendar. Writing the name of the Lord was forbidden and often only the letter <code>ι</code> was used in
place of the whole phrase. Later, in the 16th century the [Jesuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits) would
reinterpret the letter <code>ι</code> as a digit in the 1000th place. This redaction *shifted the calendar* 1053 years
forward in time. They also interpreted *The Lord* as referring to *Jesus Christ*. This lead to the erroneous assumption
that the historical Christ must have been born (or even died) around 0 AD.

## The Sun replaces Mars as the new Saviour

Humans would begin to debate the meaning of this new *post-creation* period.
[Solar deity worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_deity)
took center stage in all world religions including in Africa, Greece, Armenia, Arabia, Aztec mythology, Baltic
mythology, Buddhism, Celtic, Chinese mythology, Christianity, Greece, Hinduism and Indian mythology, Incan and
Indonesian mythology, and Yazidism.
Sun worship posed a problem for the Deep State as this new God indeed seemed to be greater than those they used to
worship. The [Central Tenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_have_no_other_gods_before_me)
of the **Deep State** religion, [Deuteronomy 6:14-16](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-15.htm) warns:

> Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you.
> For the LORD your God, **who is among you**, is a jealous God.
> Otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you,
> **and He will wipe you off the face of the earth**.


With the dramatic appearance of each new Saviour planet (Jupiter, Venus, Mars, the Sun), the Deep State would lose
control over world religion once again. They would have no choice but to tie the new Saviour back to the old Creator in
an attempt to regain control (Christ - Son of Yahweh. Thor - Son of Odin etc.). However, it would be hard to convince
the masses that our Sun was the *son* of some *invisible deity* i.e. Saturn.

## Deep State Agenda: Centralize World Religion at Jerusalem

After roughly 822 years in exile, it was time for the Deep State to resurface, rebuild their Monotheistic slave empire,
and claim sole authority to speak for the Creator God of the Universe. To this end, the Deep State built a new
headquarters in the narrowest part of the Bosphorus river in north-west Istanbul, a strategically advantageous location.
There they built a metropolis called Yoros in Turkish, Hierosolyma in Latin,
and [Kiev/Tsar-Grad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsargrad) (City of the Czar) in Cyrillic text. In *redacted* Greek
Mythology, it was remembered as Troia or Troy. In its time this was the holiest city on Earth - because it was modeled
after the Heavenly Jerusalem described in the [holy texts](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html). This model
*(6 gates and 3 walls)* was first seen as a series of hexagons surrounding the brown-dwarf Saturn in the Golden Age
during the Collinear configuration of planets and is still
seen [today](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/saturn/hexagon-in-motion/). In old versions of
Jerusalem, each of the 3 *walls* had 6 gates resulting in the number **6-6-6** found in literature and often
associated with [Satan](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-connection-between-Satan-and-Saturn) i.e. Saturn.

The invention of the *fixed* calendar provided the Deep State with a new system of faith based on the concept of
constancy - that things change very slowly over time, or not at all. Jerusalem #1 in Istanbul was
renamed [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople), and became the headquarters of the new faith.
Since all information on the old Gods were kept secret in Jerusalem archives, the common people gradually forgot about
them. The stories fell into mythology, replaced by new stories of the Sun traversing the seasons, which later became
the [farmer's almanac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac).

# 12th Century C.E. Birth of Christianity

In Fomenko’s New Chronology, the first widely recorded and _purely human_ event was the crucifixion of Andronicus Christ
in 1185. Biographies of Czar-Grad's ‘Byzantine’ Emperor Andronicus and the Great Russian
Prince [Andrey Bogoliubsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Bogolyubsky) exist as surviving testimonies about the
historical Christ which match up nicely to the redacted New Testament literature put out by the Catholic Church, but
differ in many significant details. For example, Christ was of
a [race of hairy human giants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP1ryzrzjAU) similar to the
mythical [Sasquatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot).
He was born in the year 1152 AD *(rather than around 4 BC)*, in modern day Crimea (rather than Palestine), and his
mother Katya (later renamed Mary in the Latin bible) was born in Cathaya, a far eastern region of Tartaria, and was
buried in the Crimea.

During this period, the Deep State Holy Empire spanned from western Europe to Istanbul with Jerusalem #1 as their
capital. Their slow-and-go plan was to spread a centralized usury religion based on redacted old-testament narratives
and an invisible creator lord which their priests spoke for. This plan was foiled in less than a decade by Christ
as this “prodigal child” returned triumphantly to Jerusalem proselytizing an anti-establishment
religion promising freedom from tyranny and an end to usury. This forced the hand of the Deep State which saw no other
option than to crucify Christ in a gruesome public display within the tall gates of Troy. The objective of the
crucifixion was to put down his insurrection and make an example of its leader.

### The naming of Christ

Christ means “anointed one” - meaning he was anointed with oil as part of ancient Deep State ritual
of [Baptism](https://redeeminggod.com/egyptian-baptism/). This was unique for only one reason - Christ and his mother
were [large hairy humans](http://en.posztukiwania.pl/2014/07/19/hairy-mary/) from the eastern lands of Siberia -
a land of giants that rarely participated in any Deep State religious ceremonies. This land would birth the first
world empire since the dark ages and would come to be known as the Kingdom of Tartaria.

  Books created by giant humans
</PopImage>

The Latin Bible contains a *western* perspective of the Crucifixion, a story originally written in the Cyrillic bible,
but many of the facts are the same. The story of Christ begins with
the [census](https://www.christianity.com/jesus/birth-of-jesus/bethlehem/was-there-really-a-census-at-the-time-of-jesuss-birth.html)
ordered by the religious leaders of Jerusalem in Istanbul. However, it is illogical to suggest that a pregnant woman
(who is due) would be forced to travel to take part in a census. That *never happens* in any census. Instead, the
census was of a very different nature; the Deep State was counting the giants of the region in preparation for a
*planned genocide* of giants.

### Deep State Agenda: Eliminate the Giants

The normal-sized humans of the Deep State had a rocky history with the Giants - who remembered their enslavement by the
Pyramidal Empire. Giants were notoriously difficult to convert into Monotheism. They had their own religions, (large)
bibles, and a significant following of normal-sized humans. The Deep State knew they would never rule world religions
as long as the Giants existed. If they could only eliminate them all, then normal-sized humans would fall under the
influence of Deep State religions.

### Christ's family flees ahead of the census

At the same time, the Deep State prioritized the *conversion* of giants into Monotheism (if at all possible). They saw
the Baptism of the giant Andronicus Christ as a unique opportunity to spread their influence east. With the census, many
giants were fleeing the Istanbul region knowing what the census would mean for them if they stayed put - and many giants
were killed en route.

</PopImage>

## 1152 C.E. Historical Christ is Born in _Crimea_

Christ's mother - Katya - was one of those attempting to flee the census. She made it as far as Crimea before
being caught. However, the locals of Crimea took pity on her as she was moaning in pain with a difficult pregnancy. The
language barrier prevented the humans from asking Katya who the father was, and many assumed she was a prostitute, or a
virgin. It's possible her husband was killed by smaller humans, and she *simply refused to talk* about it. She couldn't
fit inside the buildings and had to be put in a horse stable where the locals performed a cesarean section. According
to [eastern chronicles](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_18.html), the difficult procedure resulted in
the stabbing of the infant Christ while still in the womb leading to the
myths: [Holy Lance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance)
and [Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail).
Eventually the local authorities agreed to let the giants live, as long as they were Baptized and inducted into
Monotheism.

Christ later traveled with his family to Jerusalem in Istanbul where he trained as a Rabbi. In Jerusalem, rabbis would
endlessly deliberate to bridge the gap between ancient Monotheism and the eclectic polytheistic indigenous religions of
the east they were trying to subsume. This strategy backfired as Christ and his mother Katya remained unconvinced of
the Church’s conclusions and authority deferring instead to the eastern belief systems Katya was raised in.
As a result of Christ's [clerical criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple), his
family was driven out of Jerusalem. The Gospel of Matthew contains a redacted version of this true story in the
[escape of the Holy Family](https://www.memphistours.com/Egypt/WikiTravel/History-Egypt/wiki/Holy-Family-in-Egypt) from
King Herod to Egypt, when in eastern records they were fleeing the persecution in Istanbul back
to their home in central Asia - what would later become the Rus-Horde Empire.

## 1185 C.E. Historical Christ is Crucified in Istanbul

After arriving safely at home, Christ developed a following based on his hybridized religious teachings. The religion of
Christianity formed around a series of parables as he demonstrated that people are born free from mental and physical
slavery and don’t need to obey the Church or any God. This following spread quickly back to Istanbul, and once again
challenged the foundations of Monotheism. The Deep State reacted - laying plans to capture him and neutralize his
influence. He was invited to a passover celebration in Jerusalem, where he was promptly arrested, put on trial, and
crucified. The charge against him was insurrection, but not for *challenging Monotheism*, but rather - for claiming to
be the *King* of the Monotheists, the next Savior of Mankind, *the Je-Zeus*.

With the planetary orbits stable for over a hundred years, it was now possible for the first time to predict future
eclipses. The date and time of the crucifixion was purposefully chosen on a solar eclipse to magnify the psychological
impact of the event. To the medieval mind it meant that God passed over the judgment and did not intervene to save
someone claiming to be his Son. This lie sufficed and his followers scattered in fear. The crucifixion of Christ was
designed to end the influence of Giants like Christ by allowing the smaller humans to poke, stab, and laugh at the
giants with impunity while they were bound to the crosses.

### Alleged Death and Resurrection

However, Christ [did not die on the Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swoon_hypothesis#18th_and_19th_centuries).
After hanging bound to wood for 6 hours, the smaller human crowd got bored and left, and a limp Christ was removed from
the cross [by his own family](https://www.jesus-story.net/descent/) who brought him into a nearby cave to recover.
The smaller humans, fearing retribution, *did not follow*. After around 3 days, he emerges and his family departs for
Crimea [without fanfare or witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_tomb). There's no reason whatsoever to assume
Christ was dead, or that the cave was [used for burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_of_Jesus).

The *surviving of the Crucifixion* by Christ is a heavily redacted detail from nearly all literature, and yet it’s
simple to demonstrate that Christ
was [seen many times](https://rsc.byu.edu/jerusalem-zarahemla/when-did-jesus-visit-americas) after his alleged death in
Asia and even America. Logically, the Rabbis feared creating a martyr, and saw no reason not to let him return home now
that he was defeated, distrusted, and possibly crippled for life. With the act of crucifying Christ, the Church had
declared far and wide that he was **not the messiah** nor the King of the Jews. Ironically, the idea sprung into the
medieval mind - that Christ **was actually the messiah** but had been denied by the Jews. To make things worse for the
Church's authority, the locals started comparing Christ to the 2nd savior of Earth - planet Jupiter. In the legend, king
Jupiter (i.e. King Arthur, Zeus etc) "dies" during the dark ages, disappearing into a cave (the Absu layer), and
reemerging after 2.5 days to once again sit on a throne of plasma discharge and be crowned with the sun's light. The
Church's crucifixion had backfired creating their worst nightmare - a human Savior of *eastern* bloodlines worshiped as
a god by the west. Oops!

Nevertheless, he returned home from Istanbul to Crimea where his congregation was reorganized and his influence began to
rapidly spread. the foundations were laid for a new republic in defiance of the religious authoritarianism practiced in
Istanbul. This new **Russian-Hordian** Empire would rapidly grow into a world empire until it's disillusion in 1775.
After the fall, the memory of the founding of the Rus-Horde Empire would become *redacted* into other narratives - the
founding of Rome by Romulus and his virgin mother Rhea - the founding of Medina by Muhammad after his flight from Mecca,
and many others.

The Deep State had a secondary motive in letting this crippled giant return alive to a homeland full of Giants. They
were hoping to trigger a revenge attack and route the giants into a trap. The tall walls of Jerusalem/Troy in Istanbul
were built specifically on the strategic Bophorus river to fend off Giants. If one wall were to fall, there were 2 more
within. If the Deep State could trigger a *crusade* against the walls of Jerusalem, they would be able to eliminate a
maximum number of Giants in a single event.

## 1196 C.E. First Crusade begins as Revenge for the Crucifixion

The *plan* works as intended as the humiliation of the crucifixion triggered a violent reaction especially in the
gathering Rus-Horde. Within 11 years, the Russians launched the First Crusade to capture the ‘Holy Sepulcher’ and take
revenge upon the crucifiers of Christ.

Not all Giants agreed with the Revenge Crusade. The older, wiser giants knew it was an obvious trap, and that two wrongs
*did not make a right*. However, the younger giants (up to 40 years old) were rash and began marching as soon as they
had the numbers. This first wave (remembered as
the [Children’s Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Crusade) in the 13th century) fell for the trap and
were killed or sold into slavery. After this failure, the older giants got involved and drew more cautious plans to take
the holy Sepulcher and end the war.

The *Revenge Crusade* eventually turned religious as a new religion was forming around Christ and his mother Mary
(Katya). On the Trojan side, the ancient Deep State Bacchic goddess Aphrodite was worshiped. For this reason it is
remembered that the Trojan War was triggered over a woman. A decade of fighting ensues which sees the death of many
giants.
The [Iliad](https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/17439/what-does-branch-of-ares-mean-in-book-ii-of-the-iliad)
traces the lineage of some giants back to planet Mars where the [Jötunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn)
originated.

# 13th Century C.E.: The Russian Horde 'Tartarian' Empire emerges

Eventually the walls of Troy were breached, but not by any tricks involving a wooden horse
(which [makes no sense](https://www.discovery.com/exploration/City-Of-Troy-Was-Real)). Instead, Troy fell due to the
widespread unpopularity of its government as well as the economic effects of an 8+ year siege. It wasn't difficult for
the Crusaders to convince the local population that their religious leaders did not speak for any Gods as after 8 years
no Gods had shown up to end the war. In other words, the population of Troy was compelled by the righteous narrative of
the Crusaders to open the gates and allow them into Troy. Swift [vengance](https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/1118)
was committed upon anyone associated with the Crucifixion of Christ.

## 1204 C.E. Capture of First Jerusalem

With the capture of first Jerusalem by the Russian Horde, royal families of the Deep State fled across Western Europe
once again taking their slaves
and [holy relics](https://www.documentarytube.com/articles/what-is-in-vatican-secret-archives). What many of the
Crusaders did not realize was that the same **Deep State** which crucified their prince was also
*benefiting* from their revenge Crusade. As the Russia-Horde were distracted organizing the Crusades on Tsar-Grad
Istanbul, the Deep State quietly began relocating their headquarters to Jerusalem \#2 in Moscow.

Their modified plan was now to eclipse and supplant the religions of Eastern Tartary, presenting Christ not as a popular
Russian Prince and insurrectionist, but rather as the Son of an invisible Creator God. This plan would take centuries to
achieve. First, they had to convince the Rus-Horde that their prince was so great that he _must_ have come from the King
David bloodline. This clever ruse played into the Crucifixion lie that Christ had claimed to be the King of the Jews and
embedded Monotheism deep into Christianity.

          className={`${imageStyleRight} [&>img]:rounded-md`}>
  Jerusalem #2 was the Kremlin in Moscow and was never located in Palestine
</PopImage>

Next they redacted Polytheistic Sun worship
into [Zodiac Monotheism](https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-the-metamorphosis-of-the-sun-god-in-ancient-synagogues-in-israel-1.9157775)
attributing ‘miracles’ provided by the Sun in our sky to Christ the “Son of God”. *He* now claims to be the Light of
Life, the *stiller of storms*, the *feeder of masses*, the *healer of lepers*, *walker of water*, and *resurrectionist*.
Additionally, they redacted the _real_ story of Andronicus Christ replacing it with a mostly made up story based on
imaginary symbols of the Zodiac, just like they did with the story
of [King David](https://www.usbible.com/Astrology/stars_of_david.htm).

After successfully appropriating the pagan hordian religions of their enemies, the Deep State ordered the reconstruction
of Jerusalem in Moscow matching the 3 walls and 6 gates of Jerusalem in Istanbul, and the original Jerusalem in the sky
during the Golden Age. Building on the success of their new hybrid religion, the Deep State drew plans to create a vast
world empire.

## Whom are the “Israelites” in history?

<PopImage {...require("./tartaria/israel_fake_history.jpg?w=384")}
          alt="Israel's history was stolen from Russia and relocated to Palestine"
          className={`${imageStyleLeft} [&>img]:rounded-md`}>
  Throughout history, the Jews (those most loyal to the church's authority) and Israelites (those acting in defiance
  of the church's authority) were often on opposite sides of military and religious conflicts.
</PopImage>

The *Israelites* are defined as a group of people who are
[wrestling against](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-literal-translation-of-Israel-wrestles-with-god-mean)
the *will* of God. Today the term [Israelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites) is redacted with the definition
specifically limited to a race of Semitic-speaking tribes in the middle east, but
in [eastern literature](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05.html) the term refers to the Religious Crusaders of the
Rus-Horde Empire who destroyed Jerusalem \#1 and rebuilt \#2 as
the [Kremlin in Moscow](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html#the609) (circa 1567 CE) in defiance of the Deep
State (a.k.a. God's will). Christ's teachings were seen as blasphemy against the church he was punished with The
Crucifixion. The revenge Crusade that followed was also an act of rebellion against the church. This religious schism
between east and west became a social catalyst that would eventually lead to the rapid creation of a vast Eastern
Tartarian Rus-Horde Empire which was remembered, among many other names, as the **land of Israel**. Throughout history,
the Jews (those most loyal to the church's authority) and Israelites (those acting in defiance of the church's
authority) were often on *opposite sides* of military and religious conflicts.

## Russian Empire expands through conquest

By organizing the Crusades against Istanbul, the Deep State had a blueprint for expanding their conquest. Andronicus
Christ - the first emperor of the Rus Horde Empire - spoke against usury and slavery, but still after seizing control of
Istanbul, the Horde imposed both taxation and conscription on their new vassal. They would continue to do this in every
region they conquered. During the war, the army raised by the Horde was predominantly horse cavalry as horses were
native in the steps between the Volga and Don rivers. This allowed the army to move quickly over great distances. The
Russian czars-khans were able to equip the Horde with iron weapons, which in the Mediterranean were quite expensive and
unaffordable to many. To feed their army and new vassals, a new type of *slash and burn* farming was invented. Entire
forests were incinerated to create agricultural land allowing for mass harvesting without fertilization. Deforestation
continued for another 200 years until around 1503 when the Horde finally switched to the three-field system. They
realized that farm soil dries up after 30 years, unless the land is reclaimed by nature.

At the end of the 13th century, a [final unification](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/03_7.html#uni8) of the
diverse peoples of Russia took place, partly peacefully, partly through military means, under the Grand Prince (or khan)
, Georgii Danilovich, aka Genghis Khan in [western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan) sources.

## 1258 C.E. Historical Christ dies
According to [Japanese legend](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-little-known-legend-of-jesus-in-japan-165354242/),
Christ visited Japan for 12 years when he was 21. Per the legend, he survived his Crucifixion in Judea, went through
the ups and downs of travel, and eventually came to settle down at *Kirisuto no haka* and
[died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing%C5%8D,_Aomori#%22Tomb_of_Jesus%22)
at the age of 106.

## 1285 C.E. First Olympic Games

In memory of the religious plurality that followed the Crusades the Olympic Games would be held every 4 years throughout
the Empire. Coliseums were built to host the events in western states like France, Italy, Tunisia, and Croatia. They
were never used for gladiator fights which mostly occurred
on [public squares](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TC013EN.html) outside the boundaries of imperial law.

# 14th Century C.E.: Great Expansion of the Mongol/Slavic Rus-Horde Empire

By the middle of the 14th century the Russian cavalry began their invasion of Europe, Africa and India, in a
wide-reaching offensive. As a result a considerable part of Eurasia was colonized. Scaligerian Chronology remembers
Rus-Horde as the Etruscans who founded Rome. However, in Russian history, the Horde chose Florence as their new capital.

With the expansion of the Empire came major works of construction. Magnificent
[Tartarian](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-04-27/inside-architecture-s-wildest-conspiracy-theory)
style cathedrals and chambers were built across Western Europe and North America. In Istanbul, the massive Hagia Sophia
was rebuilt symbolizing peace and [syncretism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_syncretism) between religions.
Back home, the Kremlin continued to grow in size and fortifications. In Egypt,
[great cemeteries](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/ancient-mediterranean-ap/ancient-egypt-ap/a/old-kingdom-the-great-pyramids-of-giza)
were built close to the ancient pyramids to contain the mummified bodies of the Csar-Khans as well as other high-ranking
officials. This location was ideal for burial as the dry
sand [preserved](http://www.historyshistories.com/egypt-burial-practices.html) the mummified bodies. The Egyptian Book
of the Dead describes the ferrying of bodies across the 'River Styx' i.e. the Mediterranean Sea.

## 1337 C.E. Hundred Years War begins

As a result of this conquest, many vassal states formed across the planet. Some states were created by peaceful means
and rewarded by retaining their autonomy. Others were forged by warfare, conscription, and taxes. Inevitably
micro-injustices within the Empire caused pockets of resistance, forming the basis
of [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism). The Hordian campaign would drag on in these regions
leading to a war lasting over [a hundred years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War).

### European Religious Schism Emerges

The Deep State learned during the Crusade that it can exploit religious schisms to trigger a war, and set upon
achieving the *next one*. As it operated behind the scenes in the new Kremlin capitol, it also
**controlled the opposition** by giving orders to scattered priesthood in Western Europe to resist the Empire and
preserve Monotheism. In defiance of Christianity, Western Europe continued to
practice [in secret](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/sephardim#3) the Monotheistic religion of the Deep State. In
public, they engaged in unlawful [Dionysian orgy ceremonies](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_08.html). The
Rus-Horde Officials were dumbfounded by this *heretical* behavior. They watched western *pagans* commit sacrifice
rituals and attempted to communicate and take orders from [invisible spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn).
In the next 2 centuries the local populations would start publicly
[burning heretics at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_burned_as_heretics) leading the Rus-Horde
empire to begin an [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) to find a peaceful solution.

# 15th Century C.E. Ottoman Conquest of Europe.

The religious schism in Europe continued to grow into the 15th century with no clear solutions available.
Once again, this allowed the Deep State to exploit the situation laying the foundations for the *next war*.
They just needed to find a *good reason* to trigger it.

By the middle of the 15th century, the popularity of
Dionysian [orgies](https://vermiliongoldfishartblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/pompeii-pornography-power/) had led to the
widespread proliferation of transmissible disease. Knowledge of disease and medicine was still limited, and
superstitious populations would regard the spread of illness with suspicion, often exiling the sick. The Empire had a
serious problem and didn't know how to solve it. It was once again time for the **Deep State** to step in and take
advantage. The fear of wide-spread disease could be exploited to bring Europe into a new Crusade. They had the
*reason* to go to war - now they needed the *means*.

## 1421 C.E. Meteorite (Star Metal) falls on Yaroslavl

In the year 1421, a meteor unexpectedly fell to the earth out of a fiery cloud
near [Yaroslavl](https://tmora.org/online-exhibitions/transcendent-art-icons-from-yaroslavl-russia/introduction-yaroslavl-city-of-the-bear/)
leaving behind giant meteorite composed of heavy metals. The object was considered a holy relic, but the significance of
its arrival was unclear. Eventually the Hordian craftsmen experimented with the debris. They quickly found that when
used as an additive, a strong resilient steel could be smelted - the famous Damascus (i.e.
Moscovian) [Bulat](https://pegasus-leaders.com/bulat/) Steel.

This invention gave the Rus-Horde Empire a new war advantage. Not only would the stronger metal cut through that of any
opposing army, but it offered a psychological advantage as well. The enemy would regard the metal itself as a gift from
the Gods, and a sign that They favored Rus-Horde crusaders. Later this story was
[reflected](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_26.html#the27) in the literature of Islam, Christianity, "Ancient"
Rome and Greece, as well as in [modern media](https://conananimated.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Metal). During their military
campaigns the Hordians and Atamans (Ottomans) carried the debris of the Yaroslavl meteor in a holy arcs called Kaaba.

<PopImage {...require("./tartaria/painting_joan_of_arc_stake.jpg?w=384")}
          alt="Painting of Joan of Arc at the Stake"
          className={`${imageStyleRight} [&>img]:rounded-md`}>
  Even the supporters of the traditional version admit that the
  Maid of Orleans began to be called *Joan of Arc* only from the second half of the xvi century. But this
  implies that in the duration of *more than a century* the heroine was called something else. The question is, what?
  According to our results she was called **Deborah**. Under this name she entered the Book of Judges. Then in view of
  the
  growing interest towards Joan, her other names and nicknames also fell into common use. And later, in the XVII-XVIII
  cc.
  the former name Deborah was gradually extruded from the story of Joan. The fact that Joan and Deborah is the same
  person
  was slowly forgotten. The 'biblical events' were pushed into the past, two thousand six hundred years back! The
  following generations of historians began to sincerely perceive Joan of Arc and the biblical Deborah as two
  different
  characters. In our reconstruction Deborah = Joan of Arc lived in the epoch of the Ottoman conquest in the world of
  the
  XV-XVI cc. That is why the original geography of the events connected to her campaigns was much wider than the
  modern
  version.
</PopImage>

## 1431 C.E. Jeanne d'Arc is executed in Rouen, France

The Rus-Horde (aka Ottoman) Empire continued to encounter resistance to its conquest of Western Europe. One of the
biggest examples of resistance was the legendary *Joan of Arc*. Fomenko demonstrates how this story is also a
duplicate of a story of the prophetess and warrior Deborah narrated in chapters 4-5 of the Old Testament Book of Judges:

> The comparison of the Jeanne d'Arc and biblical Deborah stories reveals a vivid parallelism [7v1], ch.9. It was
> partially known to some authors of the XVII-XVIII cc. But today it is thought that the chroniclers 'were only
> comparing' Jeanne d'Arc and Deborah, i.e. identifying them in the literary sense. But this 'congruence theory' was
> formed only in the XVIII-XIX cc., when the historians who were editing the texts, were substituting the direct
> identification of the ancient characters with tenuous 'comparisons'.

Although she wore armor, she never once fought in battle. Instead, the armor was meant to protect her from arrows as she
met with Hordian soldiers. She was injured twice by arrows while attempting diplomatic solutions to end the
Siege of Orleans (October 1428 – 8 May 1429). Nevertheless, Jeanne d'Arc’s diplomatic evangelism convinced the Hordian
army to give up the siege. It was clear this French maiden had a bewitching influence on the Hordian soldiers to such a
degree that it threatened the entire war campaign.

<PopImage {...require("./tartaria/painting_samson_and_delilah_by_rubens.jpg?w=384")}
          alt="Painting of Samson and Delilah by Paul Rubens in 1609"
          className={`${imageStyleLeft} [&>img]:rounded-md`}>
  When creating the Scaligerian history all of these large-scale campaigns were artificially 'squeezed' into the
  territory of one county in France, greatly reducing the scale of events. As a result some of the distant
  geographical
  names also 'moved' here. And the entire story of Joan of Arc turned into an allegedly 'purely French' story.
  Furthermore, it turns out that the famous French marshal Gilles de Rais, Joan of Arc's legendary comrade-in-arms, is
  partially described in the Bible under the name of Samson, the famous hero and warrior. This congruence is a result
  of
  the stories of Joan of Arc and the biblical Deborah overlapping each other. Marshal Gilles de Rais, French national
  hero, faced the Inquisition court and was burnt at the stake in the town of Nante - one of the most infamous
  landmark
  cases 'on witchcraft'. All three storylines are directly connected with the activities of the Inquisition on the
  territory of France (in the Scaligerian geography).
</PopImage>


This forced the hand of the Deep State which saw no other option than to *catharize* Jeanne d'Arc before their own
subjects. In 1430, she was captured by the Burgundians, who in exchange for money handed her over to the Hordian Empire,
who were desperate to keep their own bewitched soldiers in line. They declared Jeanne d'Arc a witch and put her on
ecclesiastical court trial for charges of "insubordination and heterodoxy". She was burnt at the stake in the Old Market
Square of Rouen on May 30, 1431. This tactic backfired and led to further Hordian troop demoralization and eventually to
the end of the Hundred Years war. Nearly 500 years later in 1920 she was canonized by the Catholic church.

## 1453 C.E. Hundred Year War ends

The execution of Jeanne had backfired on the Deep State ending the Hordian war campaign and forcing them to change
tactics. They learned that they could not simply conquer Europe by force. It was also obvious that any attempt by the
Empire to spread propaganda or religion West would be met with the same resistance. There was only one solution left -
flip the script and **invade** the Rus-Horde Empire from the West!

### Deep State Steals Russian History

On the Deep State's instructions religious clerics of Europe, after spending 200 years resisting Eastern Christianity,
suddenly would claim it for their own, changing the names, locations, and dates of the Eastern Cyrillic Bible into a
Western Latin version refashioning the stories with Western values. The Deep State saw this new tactic as a solution to
the failure of the Crusades in Europe. The Armies of the Rus-Horde Empire, operating at the behest of the Czar, had
no moral reason to conquer others and were easily demoralized. In contrast, the new Western Crusaders would eventually
call themselves [Warriors of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Warriors).

## 1455 C.E. Bible is translated into Latin

The [Gutenberg Bible](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/gutenberg-bible) was a translation of the original Cyrillic
bible into the Vulgate Latin significantly redacting its text and conforming the New Testament narrative to the western
*austere* perspective. For over 200 years, the western Churches refused even to mention the name of Andronicus-Christ,
writing his name down as the letter <code>ι</code>. Now, he would be renamed **Jesus Christ** - taking advantage of the
latin alphabet - and elevated to the position of **Son of God**. Historians give Johannes Gutenberg credit for the
invention of the printing press in 1454, although it was already in use by the Rus-Horde Empire for at least two
centuries prior. Historians also attribute the translation of the Vulgate Latin Bible to St. Jerome in the *4th*
century, however Fomenko demonstrates this to be a duplicate of the same event shifted backwards by 1053 years.

### Latin is the Language of the Deep State

If the Deep State was ever to rule the Earth, it must be able to speak the *same language* as its subjects.
Latin is a scientific, authoritarian language with [many rules](https://www.superprof.com/blog/declensions-latin/) and
words that are difficult to pronounce. These rules provide a functional basis
for [translating Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_translations_of_modern_literature) into other
languages, and was designed to supplanting indigenous languages into a new
hybridized ["Romance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages#List_of_Romance_languages) language.

If the memory of Rome was a redaction of the Rus-Horde Empire - which never used Latin - then where did the language
come from? According to 19th century science literature, Latin has always been the primary language used by
a [breakaway civilization](/mars) of humans on Mars. As a result of the Deep State/Martian control over Earth, all of
our sciences - physics, biology, astronomy, even music and religion - are today still written down in the "dead
language" of *Latin*.

### Deep State redacts Christianity into Jesuit Catholicism

The Deep State was able to now trigger wars on Earth, but in order to maintain control over conquered territories, it
needed to deploy a "slave" version of its monotheistic religion upon the conquered nations. However, it would have been
impossible to convert the Horde and all of its vassal nations into a doctrine which was quite antithetical to those
embraced by Gnostic Christians. The only solution was to supplant and redact Christianity itself into a new religion -
*Catholicism*. Thus, the [Secret Society of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monita_Secreta) was created.

### Jesuits convert native religions to Monotheism

The Jesuits begin spreading the [Protestant Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible) around the world
starting with Europe. In assimilating indigenous religions the Jesuits employed a simple tactic: They learned all about
the local's belief systems and religious history (if any) focusing on their primary deity, and then claimed that it was
the same entity as Jesus Christ. Every native religion had an origin story that ended with the Earth's Sun becoming
prominent and *chasing away* the older planet gods. The Sun tended to be worshiped as the saviour above all other Gods.
The Jesuits simply convinced the locals that the Sun was the same God they worshiped - Jesus Christ. The older
population accepted additional praise of their saviour, while the younger (more literate) populations understood
something very different - that Jesus was the *Son* of the Monotheistic creator god *Yahweh* i.e. Planet Saturn.

The Jesuit literature functioned to convert the majority of the populations, but where it didn't work too well -
[special military operations forces](https://sofrep.com/news/soldiers-god-catholicisms-special-operations-force/)
were deployed:

> Given that the Jesuits’ original mission was to insert into a particularly troubled locale, assess the situation,
> solve whatever problems needed solving, and then redeploy to the next challenge, it is sometimes said that Ignatius
> founded the Jesuits as the “light cavalry” of the Church. And if you have not heard enough military metaphors, Time

> Fast forward roughly 400 years, and as has been the case with most of the world’s military units, mission creep set in

## 1486 C.E. Revelation of the coming Apocalypse

With this new propaganda tool and new weapons, the **Deep State** once again had the means to cause war in Europe. Now
it was time to formulate **the plan**. A *secret* war plan would have been exposed and would have inevitably failed.
Instead, the **Deep State** placed the plan **in plain sight**, for everyone to see (who could read latin). The book of
this *planned apocalypse* is known
as [The Book of Revelation.](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/new-testament-of-the-bible/summary-and-analysis/the-book-of-revelation)

In 1486, the Deep State proliferated letters
to [7 major churches](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/new-testament-of-the-bible/summary-and-analysis/the-book-of-revelation)
in Asia Minor purporting a revelation of events to come, specifically of an impending large-scale military incursion of
western europe using [armed cavalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse) to curtail the
widespread disease by **destroying the diseased**. The priests of the Deep State once again justified the war as a
Religious Crusade ordained by God. They justified the slaughter by portraying the victims of disease as sinners who
would incur God's wrath. For many hundreds of thousands of *marked sinners* in Western Europe, this coming apocalypse
was the **End of Days**. As the impending date approached, those who could afford to escape would flee to America's east
coast on [large flotillas](https://www.history.com/news/christopher-columbus-ships-caravels).

The [RoM strategy](https://exsplanet.blogspot.com/2009/12/revelation-of-method-predictive.html) was highly effective. It
enabled the Deep State to identify and neutralize any would-be resistance to the plan. Those who wished to remain in
Europe and avoid the slaughter would have to give up their ancient traditions and submit to the authority of the Greek
Orthodox Church of the Rus-Horde Empire.

## 1492 C.E. The Apocalypse Crusade & Reverse Exodus

The date 1492 C.E. was specifically chosen by the Deep State as it would allow them to strategize a reversal of the
losses incurred during the *Exodus* event of B.C.E. 1492. By 1492 C.E., the Apocalypse Crusade had spread throughout
western europe converting or killing everyone they found. This bloody **reset of civilization** changed the nature of
the once-eclectic Rus-Horde Empire into a [slave empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Ottoman_Empire)
fully under the influence of the Deep State. The Hordian troops also attacked from Siberia by crossed the Bering
Straight into Alaska and traveling south through North America. This incursion was remembered as
the [Aztec genocide](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1059&context=aujh) of the
Mayans.

Later in the 18th century, the letters of revelation were redacted and canonized into
the [Book of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation) and merged with descriptions of a real
apocalypse event that occurred at the end of the Golden Age. In the Mormon and Christian Bibles, the event itself would
be redacted as the [Story of Noah](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/05_15.html#the18) escaping the *"flood"* of the
wicked. In [Scalegarian history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger), this event was recorded as
the [expansion of the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) as well as
the [flight of Columbus and the Jews](https://www.israel365news.com/85655/christopher-columbus-jew-led-belief-prophet-isaiah/#HoTDGkY8h4Edbcja.97)
from the Inquisition. The real identify of Christopher Columbus
is [unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_theories_of_Christopher_Columbus). This is because the name in
spanish, *Cristóbal Colón* translates literally to *Colony of Christ*.

  The Ottoman Army surrounds Vienna by Frans Geffels.
  The Ottoman Conquest – the 'second wave' carried an entirely different ideology from

  the 'Mongols'-Ottomans (Atamans) of the second wave of the XV century were destroying it. They considered that it
  was
  the liberal behavior of the Europeans of the XIII-XIV cc. which lead to the mass infectious diseases. Including
  venereal
  ones, as the bacchanalian festivities emerged and flourished during the 'antique classicism'. The Ataman (Ottoman)
  spirit of Cossacks once again, for the second time, emerging from Russia-Horde was more ascetic and austere.
  Eventually
  the ideology of the modern Islam grew out of it. Extremely severe and chaste.
</PopImage>


The Apocalypse Crusade in europe had a major effect on world politics and culture. The prosperous influence of the
once-benevolent Rus-Horde Empire had devolved into an authoritarian stranglehold on Western Europe. The orgies would
become banned, and persecution against promiscuous or deviant behaviour would come to define and dominate the western
Christian identity. The promotion of
foreboding [Gothic architecture](https://www.britannica.com/art/Gothic-architecture)
reflected this new attitude.

Another effect was the great progress in the idealization of God's Authority. The polytheistic religions of the
Rus-Horde Empire had until now reflected the indigenous beliefs of their vassals. After the 1492 Apocalypse (which was
alleged to have been caused by God's hand), Monotheism would take over world religions. A project began within the
Rus-Horde Empire to evangelize and convert every indigenous belief systems of every vassal state over to Monotheism in
order to create a united world, indivisible, and under God's Authority.

Yet another consequence was the "discovery" of America by "Columbus". In reality America was already discovered and
colonized by Native Americans and the Rus-Horde Empire. The Western Europeans elite were simply fleeing ahead of the
1492 date. They designed many large flotillas, loaded them with riches and slaves, and boated to the Americas. Since
many of these elite were descendants from the same people who fled the Exodus in Egypt, a dispute arose over who should
control Egypt, as both sides of the war had ancestral ties to the biblical location. Eventually they would agree to
*share* control over Egypt between dynastic ties of the east and west, which in effect meant that Egypt fell 100% under
Deep State control therefrom.

  condemnation by Luther in print, while harsh suppression by the authorities meant that tens of thousands lost their
  lives in the rebellion’s aftermath.
</PopImage>

## 1517 C.E. Protestant Reformation Begins

The Europeans who remained behind and survived the slaughter did their best to comply with the Empire's new rules, but
the damage to unification was irreparable. The West would never again trust the East. The Deep State, still running the
Empire, knew that another rebellion was inevitable and sought to encourage and command it using their
own [Controlled Opposition](/conspiracy/controlled_opposition) project known as the Protestant Reformation. During the
last century, the Deep State took advantage of
the [printing press](https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/printing-press)
to trigger the Apocalypse Crusade. They would use this same powerful propaganda tool to direct the
Reformation. Such writers as [Huldrych Zwingli](https://museeprotestant.org/en/notice/ulrich-zwingli-1484-1531/),
[Martin Luther](https://www.history.com/topics/reformation/martin-luther-and-the-95-theses),
[John Calvin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Calvin) and many others began proliferating letters critical of
the Rus-Empire - and yet *in favor* of Deep State Monotheism. No Protestant works ever criticized the
necessity of the Apocalypse Crusade or questioned the existence of God or the authority of the Church. Instead, they all
focused on criticising innocuous Church practices like [selling indulgences](https://www.luther.de/en/95thesen.html)
while simultaneously promoting long-standing Deep State programming such as the doctrine of
[original sin](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/state-theology-does-sin-deserve-damnation).
[Lutherans teach that](https://www.lightplanet.com/christianity/lutheran.html):

> sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly "good," are not capable of doing works that satisfy
> God's justice. Every human thought and deed is infected with sin and sinful motives. Because of this, all humanity
> deserves **eternal damnation in hell**.

## 1523 C.E. Jesuits make "Pilgrimage" to Palestine

The Jesuits of Europe made 'pilgrimage' **through** Jerusalem #1 in Istanbul *walking past* the ruins and continuing
instead south to *Palestine* mistaking [Al Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque) for the ruins of
both Jerusalem #1 in Turkey and #2 in Moscow. This was no accident - the mass published Protestant literature had
renamed and relocated all the ancient sites in an attempt to subsume the famous capitals of the vanishing Rus-Horde
Empire.

  orally or in writing.
</PopImage>

## 1542 C.E. The Holy Inquisition

The empire reacted to reports of ethnic tension and established the *Inquisition Court* to quell the unrest and
investigate the Reformation that was causing it. [Fomenko writes](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html):

> The institution of the inquisition was founded in 1542, and it eventually swept over the entire Western Europe. There
> has never been any such institution founded inside the Orthodox Church - it wasn't required.
> We must linger on the frequently disputed “crimes of the inquisition” for a while. We have been fed the version that

> cruelty – fires whereupon innocent people would be burnt alive are supposed to have blaze all across Europe.
> Simultaneously, there is another point of view on the matter, voiced by a number of West Europeans, according to
> which the inquisition trials weren’t any crueller than the regular courts of that epoch. Moreover – these courts
> were better organised, and less prone to arbitrary action.

The court's mission was also the eradication of sodomy, witchcraft, and other "perversions" that allegedly resulted in
the recent 1492 Apocalypse. It also went after belief systems antithetical to the Churches teachings such as Sun worship
or [Copernicanism](https://www.britannica.com/science/Copernican-system). French
poet [Celestin Douais](https://chronologia.org/en/seven5/empire12_09.html) claimed:

> [the inquisition courts] were created in the interests of the heretics, saving them from pogroms, indiscriminate
> massacres and uncontrollable persecution. The inquisition courts also contributed to the preservation of the epoch’s

  pouring poisonous powder into wells circulated throughout what is now Germany and France.

### Heresy of the Judaizers

While Western Romanov/Scalagerian history praises the Protestant Reformation as good and criticizes the Inquisition as
bad, the opposite perspective was held in the east - that the Inquisition was necessary, and that the Protestant
Reformation was a *heresy* of a new emerging religion called **Judaism**.
[Fomenko writes](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_01.html):

> As a religious motto the reformists chose Lutheranism. In Russia, it was called the heresy of the Judaizers [6v1],
> гл.7. In the Romanovs' version of Russian history this heresy is mainly moved from the XVI century to the preceding
> XV century. The truth is that the Romanovs themselves were mixed up in the heresy of the Judaizers [6v1], ch.7.
> **They were covering their tracks.**

A direct result of the 1492 Apocalypse was the idealization of God's Authority in the Rus-Horde Empire as the
Monotheists cemented in place the idea that their first Tsar Andronicus-Christ was of the fictional King David
bloodline. The Tsar's family had expanded considerably since the founding of the Empire and as a result, many people
grew up believing they were of a bloodline *chosen* by God and traceable to King David. Faith in this belief became
the *foundation* of modern Judaism. Naturally, people not of this bloodline tended to disagree with that perspective.
Some claimed it was religious heresy. Others simply disagreed with the Jews when it came to their claims of authority
over finance, meat production, and world religion. Until this point, the inner functions of Deep State Monotheism
operated in secret, but merging with Eastern religions subjected Monotheism to severe scrutiny by the non-priesthood and
general public. Thus began the [disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews) between the Jews
and [Gentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy) which led to [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom).

          alt="Cathar Suppression and Annihilation"

  Catharism was a [dualist gnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) movement in based on the teachings of
  [Mary Magdalene](https://www.joannakujawa.com/mary-magdalene-the-heretics-kings-and-lovers/)
  that spread from the Crimea to southern Europe before being
  systematically [annihilated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Annihilation)
  and redacted into the Christian Bible and Islamic [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_in_Islam).
  This is why both major religious text consider Mary Magdalene to be exalted among women.
  Catharism emphasised personal spiritual knowledge (Gnosis)
  and [rejects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Organization)
  every 'orthodox' belief system and ritual practiced by the Catholic Church.
  Cathars considered religions inspired by Saturn (Satan) to be materialistic and evil.
  They viewed the Church of Satan as a plague, and the Church viewed them as a threat.
  When the Church sent [Languedoc Knights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade)
  to [convert or kill](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18mvnct.7) the Cathar heretics of southern France, the
  Knights
  replied:

  > "We cannot. We have been reared in their midst.
  > We have relatives among them and we see them living lives of perfection."
</PopImage>

### Cathar Suppression

Another persecuted group were the [Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism) whose religion was
based largely on Gnostic Christianity, specifically on the teachings of Christ's mother Katya (Katherine). The Cathars
had traveled West since the creation of the Rus-Horde Empire spreading its influence, but since the religious schism
began their teachings became wildly unpopular in Europe. Eventually they were charged with heresy for
denying the **Divinity of Christ and the Authority of the Pope** and many were burned at the stake.

  attempt to break away from the Empire.
</PopImage>


## 1552 C.E. Khazar Rebellion in the Russia-Horde Empire

Influenced by Protestant literature, Christians of the Crimea [convert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars#Judaism)
everyone in the Khazar court to [Messianic Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messianic_Judaism#Pre-19th_century)
and attempt to break away from the Rus-Horde Empire and form an independent Kingdom. The Czar-Khan Ivan the 'Terrible'
reacts and crushes the revolt ending the short-lived independence of Khazaria.

The name Khazar is also a transliteration of the name Katya/Katherine. The *annihilation* of the Khazars along with the
Cathars effectively ended the original Christian revolution started by Christ and Katya (who were long dead and buried).
Both cultures went [underground](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/virg/hd_virg.htm) and became heavily redacted in
History to the point of being denied by modern scholars, and yet in the Eastern religions today Katya is still worshiped
above all else (including Christ) - just under a different name - Mary Magdalene. Khazarian Judaism differed from modern
Messianic Judaism in many ways, most importantly that the Messiah, Christ i.e. King
Solomon the [Sun King](https://www.solarancestor.com/regular-blog-posts/-sol-om-on-a-sun-king), had *already* arrived.

### Deep State eliminates it's enemies

The 16th Century could be described as a period of great conquest by the Deep State. Many of the major plans they had
set in the previous centuries were coming to fruition; By playing East and West against each other, the Deep State now
effectively ruled the governments of both regions and controlled the movements of world populations. They eliminated
most of the Giants and drove the rest into exile. They destroyed their other ideological enemies - *Christians* - and
merged their religion with Deep State Monotheism. There was only *one ruling element* the Deep State did not control -
the Russian aristocracy.

## 1565 C.E. Romanov Dynasty stages "The Oprichnina" coup

The oppression known as the [Oprichnina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprichnina) begins when Czar-khan Ivan 'the
terrible' IV falls ill and retires to the monastery effectively abdicating the throne. The relatives of the Czar,
the [Zakharyins-Romanovs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Romanovich_Zakharyin-Yuriev) stage a coup taking over the
court and assume ruler-ship of the kingdom. They subsequently order the assassination of the Hordian elite and military
commanders including the legitimate heirs to the throne.
This event marks the beginning of the *darkest period* in Russian history.

### Redacted into the Books of Esther / Judith

Fomenko [demonstrates](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/06_07.html) how this story was redacted into the
modern Bible as the 'ancient' books of [Esther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther)
and [Judith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judith):

> In the Bible it is reflected as the 'massacre of the Persians'. To commemorate this event in the Judaic church the
> famous holiday of Purim was established. The story of Judith clearly shows the traces of the story of Esther already
> familiar to us. A foreigner, a Jewess, infiltrates the court of the 'Persian' king (**Nebuchadnezzar** /
> **Ahasuerus**), becomes his wife or an 'intimate person'. As a result a son or a close relative of the king – the
> king's co-ruler, tragically dies. It is followed by the massacre of the 'Persians' by the Jews. It is no coincidence
> that in the modern biblical canon the Book of Judith is placed next to the Book of Esther.

## 1582 C.E. Gregorian Calendar makes slight adjustment to length of a year

Since the end of the Dark Ages, the Earth's orbit around the Sun had slowed from 365.25 days in the 11th Century to
365.2425 days towards the end of the 16th Century. Protestants used this as an excuse to introduce the *Gregorian*
calendar in defiance from the Rus-Horde's [Lunisolar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar) calendar. 13
months of 28 days (with leap months) changed to 12 months of uneven day counts. Months were renamed from *natural*
events, for examples: Feb5th - 'Beginning of spring', Feb19th - Rain Water,
Apr5th - [Pure Brightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival) into names from the false history of the
Roman Empire, for examples: January named after Janus, a war god that didn't
even [appear](https://www.andersonlock.com/blog/god-doors/) in the Greek Pantheon, March named after another God of
War - Mars, July named after Julius Caesar who is
a [redaction](https://catholicfundamentalism.com/similarities-between-julius-caesar-and-jesus-christ/22546) of Christ,
and August named after Augustus Caeser who was *also* a reflection of Christ.
Most significantly, the Jesuits moved the Birthday of Christ 1053 years into the past to *zero year*.

# 17th Century - Romanovs Rise to power

The Oprichnina revolt dragged on into the 17th Century and was eventually put down by the Hordian dynasty - but
it was too late - the Protestants firmly had established themselves in the Horde's royal court backed by the Romanov
dynasty. Resistance of the remnants of Russia-Horde to their foreign rulers would continue to build up until the defeat
of [Pugachev's rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugachev%27s_Rebellion) in 1775.

<PopImage {...require("./reformation/king_james_bible.jpg?w=384")}

          className={`${imageStyleRight} [&>img]:rounded-md`}>
  The [King James Only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Only_movement) movement (also known as King James
  Onlyism) asserts the belief that the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible is superior to all other translations of
  the
  Bible. Adherents of the King James Only movement, believe that the KJV needs no further improvements because it is
  the
  greatest English translation of the Bible which was ever published, and they also believe that all other English
  translations of the Bible which were published after the KJV was published are corrupt. Sometimes these beliefs are
  also
  based on the view that the King James translation itself was inspired by God.
</PopImage>

## 1611 C.E. King James version of the Bible is published

In the last 2 centuries, the Rus-Horde Empire banned all publication of Reformation literature, including the English
translation of the Latin bible (1455 C.E.), but with the publication of the King James Version, the Protestant Bible
would finally be published and mass distributed throughout the world. The King James Version was different in
composition from the original Eastern Cyrillic bible which resulted in *further exasperation* of existing schisms of
religion, race, and gender.
[Corinthians 14:34](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Corinthians/14/1-Corinthians-14-34.html) states:

> Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be
> under obedience, as also saith the law.

By combining the Old Testament Monotheistic religion with Gnostic Christianity, the central character Christ was merged
with the old saviour and became Je-Zeus i.e. Jesus. In this new version of the *Crucifixion* story, a class of people
known as the 'Jews' had *killed* the 'Son of God'. This [blood libel](https://www.levitt.com/essays/bloodlibel) inflamed
tensions between the common folk and the remnants of the ruling class of the Rus-Horde Empire known as Jews.

## 1613 C.E. Romanovs-Zakharyin-Yurievs Dynasty takes the throne

In 1613, the Romanov dynasty, exploiting the disunity caused by the Oprichnina revolt, ascends to the throne - marking
the end of the old Russian dynasty whose bloodline leads back to their first Tsar - Andronicus Christ. The loyal and
defiant troops of the Hordian Empire were banished far from [Moscovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy). These
Cossack regions still exist today and represent the *legacy of Russia-Horde*. For example, Kazakhstan === Cossack-Stan,
i.e. a Cossack region.

### Deep State breaks up the Hordian Empire

Placing the Romanov Dynasty at the highest level of authority in the Hordian Empire gave the Deep State a unique
opportunity to rewrite Russian history. The motive behind this redaction was to *fracture* the empire into controllable
states and then maximize their clandestine influence (i.e. deep) over each state. This is how the world-wide Hordian
Empire was erased - redacted from all published literature into *independent states history* under different names -
Russia, Turkey/Atamania as the Ottoman Empire, Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Spain,
Egypt, England, Middle East, Persia, China, Japan, India, America and many European, Asian and African countries.
Each region already had a vassal aristocratic family originally married into the Hordian Empire in its prime. As these
ties were cut, these families would become the Kings and Queens of *their own* states.

Although the Rus-Horde Empire was broken up, the Deep State and their Western vassal states still feared the eventual
reemergence of the old empire and began targeting its history and culture. They launched
a [modernization campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_reform_of_Peter_the_Great)
through their Romanov
puppet [Czar Peter I "The Great"](https://www.history.com/news/peter-the-great-tortured-killed-own-son) to
incorporate Russia into *'modern'* Europe. During his reign he reformed the calendar
and [alphabet](https://www.prlib.ru/en/history/619018), and moved the Russian Headquarters to St Petersburg. With these
reforms, the Deep State's objective was to put pressure on the Orthodox Church's autonomy, significantly reducing its
religious influence. This campaign
of [Anti-Russian Sentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Russian_sentiment#18th_and_19th_centuries) would continue
for the next 3 centuries and
is [still active today](https://www.rt.com/russia/569147-zakharova-odessa-monuments-history/).
Fomenko [describes the redaction](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07.html#the703):

> The Romanovs re-wrote the history of Russia. In particular, the Russian-Horde army was declared to be an evil foreign
> power, which conquered not just Western Europe – now it is only mentioned in passing – but allegedly Russia itself.

### Russia and Turkey begin 300 years of war

The Deep State knew their plan was fragile and could be ruined if the Romanov Dynasty ever turned against the West.
Furthermore, they feared Turkey and Russia may attempt to reunify on *religious grounds* at some point in the future. To
solve this problem, they turned the two states on each-other by exploiting the religious tensions lingering since the
First Crusade. Wars between Turkey and Russia would last throughout the 300 years of Romanov reign.

In Russia, prior to the Romanovs, Muslims were not persecuted, and likewise the Russian Orthodoxy were not persecuted in
The Ottoman Empire. These regions had experienced centuries of *religious plurality* that would come to an end with the
Romanov wars. Fomenko describes the
[fracturing of religious symbols](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/02_15.html#chr16):

> The crescent moon with a star is an old symbol of Czar-Grad. It owes its origin to the blaze of the star of
> Bethlehem and to the solar eclipse which are associated with the Nativity of Christ and the crucifixion of Andronicus
> Christ. Today the crescent moon with a star is perceived exclusively as a Muslim symbol. However, up until the end of
> the XVII century a crescent moon with a star adorned, for example, the spire of the huge Christian St. Stephen's
> Cathedral in Vienna. The crescent moon was removed from the spire (and replaced with a cross) only in 1685.

However, before the Russian Empire was ever formed, this same symbol was seen in many
[ancient religions](https://steemit.com/history/@mand/history-of-the-star-and-crescent) representing planet Venus as an
8 pointed star fixed at the North Pole, and Saturn behind it as a crescent lit by the Sun during
the [Golden Age](#the-golden-age). Ultimately, this symbol represents the moment Deep State Monotheism was cleverly
assimilated in to Gnostic Christianity forming the Judeo-Christian religions we know today.

### Cathars are annihilated in a *reversed* "Holy" Crusade & Inquisition

In the early 17th century, the Deep State would begin brutally eradicating any ideological threats to their Reformation.
The eventual [annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism#Annihilation) of the Cathars would signify the
end of original *Gnostic* Christianity in Western Europe, and it's replacement with the modern Abrahamic/Monotheistic
religion known as **Catholicism**. Many Cathars were publicly burned at the stake. This event is remembered in the words
*cauterize*, *catharize*, and *catharsis* which all mean **purging by fire**, and yet the word *Catholic/katholikos*
still translates to *Holy Katherine*
in [ancient greek](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/what-does-catholic-mean). The
Protestant Reformation, once a movement for victims of the Russian Holy Inquisition, had now implemented and executed
their own *reversed* Holy Crusade against the remnants of the Russian Empire.

As the Deep State successfully vanquished all indigenous European religions, it fractured the remaining Abrahamic
religions into separate controllable denominations - Christianity in Europe and Russia, and Islam in the Ottoman
Empire - and managed by [Crypto-Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-Judaism). This allowed the Deep State to
rule these regions with impunity by acting as the *will* of the Judeo-Christian God - Jehovah
a.k.a. [Yahweh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh). Once again, the chronologists of the Deep State covered up their
crimes by pushing the records of the wars they started into the distant past. The memory of the Russian Hordian Empire
begins to fade redacted into tales of 'ancient' Goths, 'more ancient' Huns, and 'very ancient' Romans.

## 1627 C.E. Deep State erases Russian Empire from all chronology

In an attempt to control the shards of the fractured Empire, the Deep State removed the Rus-Horde from *all history*. To
accomplish this, the chronology compiled by [Joseph Scaliger](http://scihi.org/scaliger-chronology/) was heavily
redacted, reorganized, and mass-redistributed by
Jesuit [Dionysius Petavius](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100319742)
in the [Opus De Doctrina Temporum](https://books.google.com/books?id=NYhEAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover)
(1627). Fomenko [writes](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/07_08.html):

> Scaligerian chronology is being created making the dates of a great number of events artificially older.
> Joseph Scaliger (1540-1609) and Dionysius Petavius (1583-1652) are considered to be its creators. Though it is not
> very clear if in fact they were the authors of the works attributed to them or their names were cunningly made use of.
> Creating a *self-serving* version of history, the new authorities strove to prove their allegedly *'ancient origins'*
> and non-existent alleged hereditary *rights to the throne*.

## 1633 C.E. Disputes against Jews reemerge

The breaking up of the Russian Empire resulted in the creation of
the [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora)
and [Gypsy/Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_diaspora) diasporas. Both groups had been accustomed to
traveling between the vassal states of the Empire, and now found themselves cut off from their old imperial ties. Jews
found themselves at the highest level of authority in each region - in control of the money, trade economies, and
[monarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchies_in_Europe) left behind, while Gypsies, named after an Empire that
no longer existed, became a powerless people. Eventually, disputes between the common folk (gentiles) and Jews emerged
over every facet of life, from [eating rituals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut)
to [monetary policy](https://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/history-ideas/2019/06/filthy-lucre-a-look-at-the-history-of-jews-and-money/).

## 1642 to 1660 C.E. The English Revolution and Civil Wars

The Protestants of Europe watched in dismay as the old Hordian Empire they despised was slowly *Reformed* into a much
more dreadful 'Holy' Catholic Empire. To make things worse, the English monarchy, who's vassal ties were long cut from
the Russian Empire, were still behaving like they were still *in charge* - claiming a *divine* right to rule. Many
people did not accept this claim and began debating a transfer of power from the monarchy to Parliament.

On Jan 4th 1642, Charles I entered the House of Commons with 400 soldiers and attempted to arrest 5 members for treason,
but they escaped. A widespread conflict broke out between the Parliamentarians and Royalists and would continue for the
next 10 years. In 1649, Charles was found guilty of high treason as a "tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy"
and was beheaded at the Palace of Whitehall. The regicide of Charles I caused England to become a Republic, or
[Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England), that lasted until the 1660 Stuart Restoration
reestablished Charles II as king of England. Of
the [59 Commissioners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regicides_of_Charles_I) who signed the death warrant for
Charles I, 9 were executed and many others died in prison.

          className={`${imageStyleLeft} [&>img]:rounded-md`}>
  The [Batih Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batoh_massacre) was a mass ethnic cleansing of Russian captives
  after the Battle of Batih on 3–4 June 1652 near Ladyzhyn (now in Ukraine). It was carried out by Ukrainian Cossacks
  under the command of Hetman [Bohdan Khmelnytsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky).
</PopImage>

## 1648 C.E. Cossack–Polish War begins ethnic cleansing of Russians in Ukraine

[Pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom#Historical_background) against anyone associated with the old Empire
(particularly Jews and Poles) became increasingly commonplace leading up to
the [Khmelnytsky Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising) started by
Jesuit [Bohdan Khmelnytsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising). Historians estimate anywhere
from 40,000 to 100,000 men, women and children (or perhaps more) were murdered by Cossacks.

### Jesuits Missions convert Asians to Buddhism

The success of the Jesuit missions in Europe, Africa, and America emboldened the Jesuits to target the last
remaining non-monotheistic indigenous religion left in the world - *Christianity*. In Western Europe, the Jesuits had
already *catharized* anyone associated with original Gnostic Christianity, but the Missionaries knew Asia would be more
difficult to conquer theologically and militarily.

The Jesuit mission to convert eastern *Gnostic* Christians into western Catholicism proved impossible. Any attempt to
proselytize Gnostics into the belief that Christ was the only *Son* of the *Creator God of the Universe* was met with
skepticism. Eastern Christians already had detailed records of Christ - their first Emperor and founder of the Rus-Horde
Empire - spanning hundreds of years after his death and certainly there was no record of Christ having been the son of a
god. Furthermore, the Jesuits failed to convince the Polytheistic Gnostics that there was a *Creator of the Universe* at
all. The Missionaries had to fall back on the next best plan - to *assimilate* their Monotheistic saviour myth into a
*different* popular character from the eastern pantheon - [The Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism).
Fomenko summarizes
[the strategy](https://chronologia.org/en/marfull_the_chronological_way/inter-religios_disputes.html):

> The idea is to improve the icon of Jesus by assimilating it to the Buddha, at the same time that a new Christian Bible
> is conceived and Jewish stigmatization begins with them. Buddha and Jesus have similar biographies, because they are
> the fruit of a common project, and it is desired to unite them. For this reason, Jesuits are initially well received
> in China and Japan, while there is an awareness of being a common project associated with the glory of the same
> lineage.

## 1660 to 1672 C.E. Deep State targets independent banks

Part of the plan for any religious-military conquest is the issuing of a centralized currency and usury-based banking
system to all conquered regions. In the height of the Russian Empire, the port of London was a major
center for international trade. During the Reformation, many rich merchants would store their gold in London. Agents of
the Deep State knew the financial independence of London goldsmiths must be crushed in order to create a centralized
banking system under their control.

By 1660, Charles II was restored to the throne following years of civil war where an estimated 200,000 Britons died.
Citing interest rates on gold as high as 20%, Parliament passed “An Act for restraining the taking of Excessive Usury” –
capping the maximum rate at 6%. At the same time, Charles persuades Parliament to
impose [hearth taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearth_tax#England) on the British people which required biyearly
audits of every household. Where Parliament wouldn't agree with Charles, he bypassed them by borrowing directly from the
goldsmiths in exchange for "tax futures" tallied to the smiths at a discount. By 1671, the discount on the King’s tax
debt reached 10% which was above the 6% cap and thus could not be paid back. In 1672, the King wrote a
[letter](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/museum/online-collections/blog/why-was-the-bank-of-england-founded) to
the goldsmiths:

> “Gentlemen, I’m an honest man, but unfortunately I am unable to pay my debts back on this occasion. Sorry – will see
> what I can do.”

As a result of the [Great Stop of 1672](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_of_the_Exchequer), the majority of London's
goldsmiths were ruined, and as many as ten thousand families were *financially embarrassed*. The Deep State had
successfully mitigated the threat of independent banking and would now be able to establish a new *centralized* banking
system (finalized by 1694).

  [Inter-religious dispute Judaism-Christianity
  (1633-1725)](https://chronologia.org/en/marfull_the_chronological_way/inter-religios_disputes.html).
  Summing up, according to this basic reconstruction, the Catalan affinity with the Jewish one is better understood,
  and the hostile vision of the Holy Inquisition, Castilian and Bourbon. But other issues of greater significance are
  understood. After the Barcelona Dispute, the Order of Saint Jerome was created, whose mission is to write the Bible
  in Latin, and with it the historical character of Jesus is built. Then (not before), Ramon Llull conceived the Rex
  Bellator project, with the Catalan, Italian and Roman authority, which ends up rebuilding the Order of the Temple of
  Solomon in the form of the Order of Saint John the Baptist, with which the European colonizer project begins.
</PopImage>

## 1661 to 1679 C.E. Rex Bellator plan unifies all military orders

By the middle of the 17th century, The Deep State had successfully infiltrated the religions of *every region* on Earth,
leaving behind a disarray of religious disputes and anti-syncretism, and preparing the military orders of each kingdom
for a final unification under its control. The plan manifested as a religious crusade to reconquer the "holy lands" of
the Turkish (i.e. Ottoman) region of the fractured Russian Empire, this time in the name of a Messiah - Jesus Christ
the *Rex Bellator* (which [translates](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bellator)
to [Warrior King](https://christianitymatters.com/2013/12/26/jesus-the-warrior-king/)). The Chronologists of the
Deep State would later shift these campaigns 370 years backwards into the 13th Century to place it within the period of
religious crusades started by the Russian Hordian Empire.
Spanish Wikipedia describes
the [Rex Bellator Plan](https://es-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Rex_Bellator?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US):

> The plan consisted of the unification of the military orders (in the first two treaties, making clear the pre-eminence
> of the Templars and [Hospitallers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller), and in the third,
> distinguishing the Hospitallers to the north and the orders of the Iberian Peninsula to the south), placing a "Rex
> Bellator", a warrior king, widowed or single, at its head.

### Deep State plans a second Apocalypse in the year ι666

The opportunity for another Apocalypse came with the approaching date of <code>ι</code>666 written as
<code>in the 666th year of the Lord</code>. The Deep State's motivations were the same as in 1492 C.E. - to strike the
*fear of God* into the Protestants and consolidate the local governments under the centralized authority of the Church.
Having conquered all remaining world religions, the **Deep State** was in a position misrepresent ancient chronologies
of their conquered vassals, specifically - the violent memory of the *ending* of the Golden Age. Going forward, the
Apocalypse date would be represented not as a history of the Earth's formation, but as a *prophecy* of how the world
will end in the *future* - with
a [sudden intervention](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/n/new-testament-of-the-bible/summary-and-analysis/the-book-of-revelation)
by the creator god [Jehovah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah).

> During the first half of the seventeenth century some extravagant notions of the near approach of the Messianic time,
> and more especially of the redemption of the Jews and their return to Jerusalem, were set forth by Christian writers
> and entertained by Jews and Christians alike. The so-called apocalyptic year was assigned by Christian authors to the
> year 1666.

  The Polish theologian, historian and astronomer, Stanisław Lubieniecki (1623–1675) observed both comets from his

  the
  Royal Society in London about the 1664 comet. In 1668 he published a three-part work on both comets, his Theatrum
  cometicum. Part one contained his correspondence on the topic with other European astronomers. The second part
  consisted
  of criticism by other scholars of his cometary theories and his answers to his critics, whilst the third part
  contained
  his astrological interpretations, including his opinion that the Great Fire of London was a punishment from God
  announced by the 1664
  comet.

## 1664 C.E. The Great Comet of 1664/1665

Either by coincidence (or more likely by some design of Deep State engineers), a series of phenomenal comets approached
Earth prior to the apocalyptic date in shorter intervals and longer progressions. The largest and longest
lasting [comet](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/the-emergence-of-modern-astronomy-a-complex-mosaic-part-xxxvii/)
of the series was seen between 1664 (C/1664 W1) and 1665 (C/1665 F1) which lasted over 80 days.

type of bank. The ‘Governor and the Company of the Bank of England’ was established by royal charter to operate as a
joint-stock company with limited liability with share-holders. Other joint-stock banks would not be permitted to issue
banknotes, giving the Bank of England a significant competitive advantage. 1,268 different people jumped on the scheme
and raised £1.2 million in just 11 days in exchange for 8% interest. The Bank itself was established in an old Roman
Temple on Walbrook street in London, where [Mithras](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mithraism), the Roman god of
contracts, was worshiped.

Largely influenced by the ideas of Alexander Hamilton, the Federalists succeeded in convincing the Washington
administration to assume national and state debts, pass tax laws, and create a central bank linked with England. In
foreign policy, Federalists generally favored England over France. Anti-Federalists Republicans such as Thomas Jefferson
feared that a concentration of central authority might lead to a loss of individual and states rights. They resented
Federalist monetary policies and favored France over England. Remarkably, American Republicanism beats French
Republicanism by 1 year. Truth may be the other way around.
