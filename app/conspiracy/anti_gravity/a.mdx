## Q: Why did that Boeing crash? Yet again we don't get an _'ex

plane'_ ation. Turns out [Flying Fortresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress) have a heavy
secret behind them...

Imagine you're on a Jumbo Jet airplane and suddenly all the engines stop working, what happens next?
Well .... the next thing that happens is that all these bags drop out of the ceiling, and you are ordered to put them
on, and they make you calm within seconds or pass you out, depending on the switch hit and air-canister triggered.
Why is it necessary for an airline to be
able [sedate](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/air-canada-passenger-dark-empty-plane-alone) airline passengers?

Consider: In all heavier-than-air jet planes (like Jumbo Jets), if one or multiple jet engines
fail, [only one jet engine](https://simpleflying.com/smartwings-boeing-737-800-engine-shutdown/) is required to stay in
the air!
There is no explanation yet from Boeing (or NASA) as to how Jumbo Jets can stay in the air with only a SINGLE ENGINE
operating on one (not both) wings.
There are
many [real life examples](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2019/01/15/miracle-on-the-hudson-10-year-anniversary-)
where _all_ engines failed,
and yet the plane was able to turn 180 degrees and return safely to the ground.

We objectively have to agree after the last few high-profile crashes and accompanying plot-twists that Boeing is not
being completely honest, right?

## Q: Are the inventors of jumbo jets lying to the world?

Well, _History Repeats!_ So lets take a closer look...

All [technological advances](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/historpedia/home/science-technology/developments-in-airplanes-between-world-war-one-and-world-war-two-fall-2012)
in Human History have coincided with acts of war. 1914 saw both the makings of a World War and the advent of small
bombers like the [Voisin III](https://www.historyhit.com/18-key-bomber-aircraft-from-world-war-one/) which was capable
of carrying up to 60kg of bombs. 1938 saw the introduction of massive air ships like
the [Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-17_Flying_Fortress#Initial_orders)
leading up to World War II.
There should be no doubt that
[WW1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_I)
and [WW2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II)
were decided in the air, not on the ground.

**Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Great Wars of the 20th century were
perpetuated through international conglomerates like the Boeing Corporation.**

The universe is [electric](https://www.electricuniverse.info/pseudoscience-and-the-electric-universe/) in nature.
Therefore,
electromagnetic [zero-point-energy](http://www.zpenergy.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2938&mode=thread&order=1&thold=0)
technology is possible.
The force of electromagnetism
is [10\^39](https://principia-scientific.org/electromagnetic-gravity-examination-of-the-electric-universe-theory/)
stronger than the force of Earth's Gravity, making "anti-gravity" technology trivial and easy to design.
This principle can be easily demonstrated with [electromagnets](https://education.jlab.org/qa/electromagnet_is.html).
The Great War exposed this technology for the first time, but built it into the planes in such a way that their own
pilots and engineers could not detect it.
The planes became automated with all pilot decisions replaced by machines. Thus, the Boeing Bombers could be piloted by
a child of any age.

## Q: What machines use this flying technology?

Small helicopters, stunt planes and RC model toy planes do _not_ need ZPE technology to fly,
but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B24, B29..) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited
weight) in bombs.
**All passenger jets use ZPE electro-gravitic thrusters** to both reduce the effect of gravity upon the plane as well as
stabilize the flight itself.
_It is for this reason that a Jumbo Jet can fly with a wing of engines disabled without rotating towards the dragging
wing (and immediately dropping out of the sky)._
ZPE / ElectroGravitic technology has both a vertical thrusting effect and a horizontal stabilizing effect on a craft.
It's a flawless technology that provides any craft with the ability to sustain normal flight in the event of a
catastrophic multi engine failure (Anyone get that reference?).

## Q: Sooooo.... why did that Boeing Crash then?

If planes cannot ever crash, if they have a secret technology that keeps them from ever crashing, then what about all
the plane crashes in the news?
There is only one _Ex-Plane-Ation_ left if you rule out mechanical or pilot failure. The plane crashes are simulated.
Here's how:

First, your target plane _Flight123_ is chosen for a scheduled crash. The plane takes off and a crash is scheduled for
right after takeoff, or somewhere within the trip.
When the moment of the crash comes, Flight123 goes dark. It loses communication with all controllers and the pilots lose
control of the craft. It becomes fully automated.
At this exact same moment, Flight123b goes live. What is Flight123b? It is an identical aircraft, completely empty of
passengers and pilots, flying nearby (within 10-50 miles).
Get it?

Now, Flight123b does not communicate with the controllers. Instead, it is immediately shot out of the sky, or has a
scheduled mechanical failure. It crashes. There are videos.
Finally, Boeing employees arrive to bulldoze the crash site and erase all evidence, crushing victims bones. Right?
Wrong. Flight123, the REAL flight,
with the actual passengers and pilots has landed safely in a remote location, an airport you and I have never heard of.
Classified.
Now, we all know how this story Ends. Boeing convinces all families to settle for $X,XXX,XXX. But what is the real
reason these
families are historically okay with taking money for the lives of their loved ones?

Because they didn't.

The family members are released to their families when, _and only when_, they have all signed their right to discuss the
crash away for the rest of their lives.
Cooperative or not, the families have absolutely no way to fight back against a lawless international conglomerate. I
would imagine the most uncooperative families
are made aware that only by their own actions would they *actually* have lost someone in the crash. Would you trade your
son, daughter, wife, husband's life for the truth?

__Yes. Yes you would.__

## Q: Okay so, how does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time?

Lots of ways. Here's some:

* 1\. You _can not_ get an aviators license without _direct approval_ by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test
proving that you 'understand' (believe in) aerodynamics heavier-than-air flight. This separation from the public
results in people having a church-like faith in airplanes or complete fear in them.
* 2\. Everyone knows that NASA has always been corrupt and inaccessible to women and minorities; a pseudoscience _boys
club_ run like a giga-church, but most people don't know NASA was created entirely in-house
by [Lockheed Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_Space_Systems) and Boeing. This martial-religious
centralization is designed to keep outsiders (us) from getting too close to the industry secrets.
* 3\. Jet Propulsion Labs (JPL) insists only jets are capable of propulsion needed for space travel, even though ion (
EM) thrusters have been used in space probes since 1964.
* 4\. Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 _YEARS_. The identical design shared by all plane manufacturers
is a result of their development always being in secret.
Example: [AirBus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Airbus#Development_of_the_A380).
* 5\. [Jumbo jet terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories#No-planes_theory) justified further
locking airports and flying technology.
* 6\. Suppressing of technology at the government and media level is the explanation for
all [UFO](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7679-0627-2) sightings.
Sorry, [bug-like aliens](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/05/28/forced-faked-alien-abductions-were-conducted-by-the-cia-according-to-renowned-researcher/)
was a psyop to hide suppressed technology.
* 7\. Science Fiction movies (like _The Incredibles_) constantly put in references to real suppressed technology to
associate that technology with science fiction.
* 8\. Suppressing of technology explains the ChemTrails phenomenon as no human pilots would be required to pull it off
world-wide. **Fully automated unmanned craft are responsible for all ChemTrails**.
* 9\. Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombed instead of airports. Napalm, specifically. Sometimes
Willie Pete. I'm not sure which is scarier.

**By Endless War**. The 20th Century was our darkest century and we were all born in it's shadow. That same darkness and
fear is felt today, preventing us from finding our way.

A Jumbo Jet Aircraft like the 747-400 stores it's fuel in 3-5 tanks within the wings. This of course make no sense, as
the plane could have been designed with fuel tanks elsewhere. The essential design of any ZPE electrogravitic module is
a large, circular apparatus with a rotating EM emitter inside which rotates counter to the earth's EM field.
Such a device can be easily hidden within the body of any plane, however, the most ideal location would be within the
jet engines themselves which are already designed with a super fast rotating turbine disks.

## Jumbo jets flying without engines:

"Can The Airbus A380 Fly On One Engine?" Yes, but this article fails to explain how.  
[https://simpleflying.com/one-engine-a380/](https://simpleflying.com/one-engine-a380/)  
Here's how: If electro-gravitic thrusters are built horizontally into the wings, then yes, the plane should be able to
sustain lift with one (or even zero) engines still running.  
Can hollow metal wings lift a plane using wind alone? **No.**

When jet engines fail, the passengers feel no drop. Just like in LoonyToons! <small>(Fun fact: 6 months after I posted
this article, the pilot of the Hudson Miracle Landing died. Guess I can't interview him now...)</small>  
"It was a very foreign feeling - the plane actually shuddered and kind of stopped in mid-air," said one passenger.

"As the flight was over the Aegean Sea and 100 nautical miles northeast of Athens, Greece, the left-hand engine
experienced a spontaneous shut down. The crew responded to this occurrence by decreasing its altitude from FL360 to
FL240\. The flight continued at this altitude until landing without further incident – two hours and 20 minutes
later."

gliding performance**."

"Beginning in late 1965, a number of B-52Ds underwent Big Belly modifications to increase bomb capacity for carpet
bombings. The modification created enough capacity for a total of 60,000 lb (27,215 kg) using 108 bombs. Thus modified,
