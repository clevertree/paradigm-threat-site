"What the notoriously corrupt United States federal government is claiming is to have sent men to the moon in 1969, on
the VERY FIRST attempt, even though right here on earth Mt. Everest and the South Pole took NUMEROUS tries before
success, allegedly accomplishing this amazing feat with 50 YEAR older technology (a cell phone has ONE MILLION times
more computing power than ALL of NASA did in 1969), yet 50 YEARS later NASA can now only send astronauts ONE -
THOUSANDTH the distance to the moon, even with 5 DECADES more advancements in rockets and computers.

"If Toyota claimed they made a car 50 YEARS ago that could travel 50,000 miles on one gallon of gasoline, yet today
their best car can only go 50 miles per gallon, or ONE - THOUSANDTH the distance, would not the forgery of the previous
claim be incredibly obvious? If it were not for people's pride and emotional attachment to the 50 YEAR OLD unrepeatable
moon landing claim, also with only ONE - THOUSANDTH the distance capable 5 DECADES later, they would otherwise easily
recognize this equally preposterous claim as the fraud that it sadly is.

"The alleged moon landings are the only technological claim in the entire history of the world, such as the first
automobile, airplane, or nuclear power, which was not far surpassed in capability 50 YEARS later, much less not even
able to be duplicated by any nation on earth 50 YEARS later. The supposed moon landings are also the only time in
history that such claimed expensive technology was deliberately destroyed afterwards (175 BILLION DOLLARS worth), only
done so to hide the evidence of the fraud.

"Seeing how it is IMPOSSIBLE for technology to go BACKWARDS and today NASA can only send astronauts ONE - THOUSANDTH the
distance to the moon as was claimed 50 YEARS ago on the VERY FIRST attempt with 5 DECADES OLDER technology, the only
remaining conclusion is that the 1969 claim was a federal government lie. It is that simple and that corrupt.

"Award winning filmmaker Bart Sibrel (Sibrel.com) presents his highly acclaimed controversial documentary "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Moon" which debuts newly discovered behind-the-scenes out-takes from the supposed first
mission to the moon showing the crew staging the photography of being "halfway to the moon", conclusively proving that
they never left earth orbit, as is still NASA's limit today 50 YEARS later.

"The CIA is even heard on a private, third audio channel, prompting the crew to respond to Mission Control only after
four seconds have elapsed, in order to create the false impression of an increased radio delay, so as to appear farther
from the earth than they really were. In Sibrel's second film "Astronauts Gone Wild" a microphone accidentally records
an astronaut privately discussing telephoning the CIA to have investigative journalist Bart Sibrel assassinated,
something that would not be necessary if Sibrel's discovery of the fraud was not true.

"Sibrel has been interviewed, and his documentary about the moon landings have been featured on, The Tonight Show, The
Daily Show, Geraldo at Large, The Abrams Report, Coast to Coast, NBC, CNN, FOX, HBO, Time Magazine, the New York Times,
the L.A. Times, the Washington Post, and USA Today.

"All Truth passes through three stages.
First, it is ridiculed,
Then it is violently opposed,
Finally it is accepted as self-evident.
-Arthur Schopenhauer-

"In an age of universal deceit,
telling the Truth is a revolutionary act.
Whoever controls the past, controls the future.
-George Orwell-

"One of the saddest lessons of history is this:
If we’ve been bamboozled long enough,
we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.
We’re no longer interested in finding out the Truth.
The bamboozle has captured us.
It’s simply too painful to acknowledge,
even to ourselves,
that we’ve been taken.
Once you give a charlatan power over you,
you almost never get it back.
-Carl Sagan-

"It is easier to fool people,
than to convince them that they have been fooled.
-Mark Twain-
