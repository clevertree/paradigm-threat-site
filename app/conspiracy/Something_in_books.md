## There must be something in books
```
There must be something in books, things we can’t imagine, 
to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don’t stay for nothing.'”
Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451

Two years ago, before The Great Virus Hoax, I dragged a sack of clothes into the laundromat, stuffed them into a machine with detergent and then found a seat among the other patrons.  There is a point to all this rambling.  I need to set the stage, so please keep reading.

Seated comfortably, I pulled a book from my purse and started to read.  Some women keep makeup, laptops, snacks and clean underwear in their purses.  I keep a supply of books.  After a few minutes I looked up and found a young man, about junior high age, standing in front of me.  He was staring at me with his head to one side, as rapt as if a second head was growing out of my neck.

"Is that good?"  He asked, indicating the book.

I don't remember the title, only that it was science fiction.  I showed it to him, said it wasn't the best I had ever read, but I would recommend it.  The boy smiled politely, his eyes shifting from side to side the way people's eyes do when they realize they are talking to a crazy person  Then he sidled across the room back to his family.

This is certainly the first time in his life this youngster has seen anybody reading a book of their own free will.  This kind of thing has happened to me with increasing frequency over the past decade or so; on buses, in lunchrooms, waiting rooms and in stores (I always read while waiting in line).  Magazines used to be available in public waiting areas.  Now people just sit and play with their phones.  I'm honestly not sneering at the prevalent use of cellphones.  As Seinfeld says "Not that there's anything wrong with THAT."

Just about the only thing us "conspiracy theorists" or "Truthers" or whatever we call ourselves can agree upon is that there is something going wrong with our world.  Even the most ardent believer in the status quo like my brother-in-law Daniel (please see my article "Wake Up, Neo" if you have an overwhelming urge to read more about Daniel) will reluctantly admit "Well, yeah.  All this stuff happening can't be good."   I have to add that when Daniel helped us move, he looked around at the boxes and boxes of books and asked me why I didn't just throw them all out and get a Kindle.  I could then keep the house cleaner.  He was serious.

And we can also all can agree pretty much that some kind of secret cabal or Nefarious Elite, as I like to call them, are running things around here and have infiltrated the governments that we have supposedly chosen to lead us.

Don't ever forget that these hidden creatures are masters of human psychology.  They know us better than we know ourselves, and that has been engineered on purpose.  And the easiest way to do this is to keep us from reading books.  Keep us away from the minds of other humans, away from their discoveries and ideas and thoughts.  Everything that makes us all human beings together.  The masks and "social distancing" (Dear God in Heaven, how I hate that word!) are but the Nefarious Elite's latest joke on us.  And believe me, they are all laughing hysterically about it.  But this censorship is even more damaging to us as a species.

But, you protest, that's not true.  We can read anything we want, order any book off the internet, go into Barnes & Noble (in a mask) and buy any book or magazine.  This is America.  Nobody censors literature.

I used to think that too.  Then several years ago I tried to buy a book on Amazon about Sandy Hook by Jim Fetzer that I KNEW I had seen listed for sale.  It was gone.  I called them and a stuttering customer service representative assured me no such book existed.  Or had ever existed.  I must have imagined the whole thing. She acted as if I was calling from the Planet Wookie.  In the end, I only got to read the book because Fetzer posted it online so people could read it for free.

Since then Amazon has been unlisting hundreds, maybe thousands of books.  And they do it sneakily, hiding listings or taking them off and then putting them back on and then off again.  They will even remove books you have already purchased on your Kindle.  This is why I refuse to use ebooks.

The despicable minds in the Great River have come up with another way to keep certain books out of a reader's hands.  Some books, usually on conspiracies (of course), spirituality, alternative history, criticism and other topics that seem unrelated have had their prices raised to three or four figures.  And these are books still in print and available elsewhere at much lower prices.

I called Amazon (yes, I'm a glutton for punishment) and asked them why Robots' Rebellion by David Icke was over eight hundred dollars when it could be purchased on Alibris for about twenty dollars.  The only answer I could pry out of them was that Amazon intended to stand by its pricing.  Well, that clears THAT up!  I finally got tired of torturing low level Amazon employees and hung up.

A probable reason for this price ju-ju is to encourage people to buy Kindle books.  The David Icke book on Kindle sells for $7.99.  This will allow the cyborgs running Amazon to simply remove whatever books they wish from your device.  Or even delete things from inside the book.

I don't know what is going on in schools regarding books and reading.  From the evidence, I don't think it is good.  I'm very thankful my son is an adult and I don't have to take him out of school and teach him myself.  Which I would do,

The Nefarious Elite are too smart to send men in black uniforms running into your homes to drag out all your books, spray them with kerosene, and burn them on your front lawn.  They are developing more efficient methods that we don't even notice.

However, this home book policing might occur in the future.  Who can tell?  If  so, I hope I'm dead by then.  If not, I fully intend to stand with my books and we'll all go up in flames together.

By the way, please don't get in touch with me regarding David Icke.  I mention his book not to get into the question of his veracity but simply as an example.   And my house definitely would be much cleaner if I got rid of my books and stopped wasting time reading.  But that's not going to happen.
