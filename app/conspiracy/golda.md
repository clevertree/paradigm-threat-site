## Was Golda Meir really a man? This section will investigate.

Could it be that Golda was born a boy? This might explain away many of the many contradictions in her life. 

> “An androgynous, who presents both male and female physical traits, is in some ways like men and in some ways like women. 
> In some ways, they are like both men and women, and in other ways, like neither men nor women." (Bikkurim 4:1)

In 1898, Goldie Mabovitch, who later became Golda Meir, was born in Kiev, Ukraine.
In 1906, she leaves Russia, with her mother and sisters, to join her father in America. They land in Quebec, Canada and then travel by train to Milwaukee. Because her father had helped a friend reach America by pretending that the friend’s wife and daughters were his, the rest of the Mabovitch family now has to use false names to depart.
Milwaukee was the site of the transgender pioneer Harry Haynes a.k.a. Brown, Millie and many others

In 1913, after making her plans, 14-year-old Golda steals out of her house and takes a train to Denver in February. She moves in with her sister, her sister’s husband (Shamai Korngold) and their child (Judith) who live in a small duplex located in West Denver and enrolls at North High School on February 17. She listens to the heated debates that take place among visitors to the Korngold kitchen on a variety of topics ranging from Yiddish literature, Zionism, anarchism and socialism to women’s suffrage, trade unionism and dialectical materialism. In her autobiography Golda writes, “to the extent that my own future convictions were shaped and given form, and ideas were discarded or accepted by me while I was growing up, those talk-filled nights in Denver played a considerable role.” In a different context, she put it this way, “Denver was a turning point because my real education began. In Denver, life really opened up for me.” As part of her life opening up in Denver, Golda meets and dates Morris Myerson (or Meyerson) who has passion for the arts, music and Golda.

1921: Immigrates to Palestine, joining a kibbutz.

In May 1939 just before World War II broke out. At that time the British, fearing an Arab shift toward the Axis powers, issued a white paper severely restricting Jewish immigration. David Ben‐Gurion, who was to play a vital role in securing Israeli independence, fixed the lines of Jewish oppostion: “We shall fight Hitler as if there were no white paper and fight the white paper as if there were‐no Hitler.”

1944: U.S. Immigration and Naturalization documents state that her father Moshe (Morris) passes away, though Golda’s autobiography gives the year of his death as 1946.

In 1946, after the British rounded up male leaders of the Jewish Agency, Golda Meir was appointed the acting head of the Political Department. This occurred when Moshe Sharett and other key figures were arrested and detained. She took over the responsibility of coordinating the Jewish Agency's response to the British authorities and working to secure the release of her colleagues. 

> In May 1948, with five Arab armies massed on Israel’s borders, Meir disguised herself as a Muslim woman and crossed into Trans-Jordan for a secret meeting with King Abdullah, to try to persuade him to stay out of the war. Abdullah, King Hussein’s congenial grandfather, with whom she had already had two clandestine encounters, received her with respect but remained unresponsive to her pleas.

1948: On May 14, Israel’s independence is declared. The ceremony takes place in the Tel Aviv Art Museum and Golda Myerson is one of those signing the document. She travels again to America to raise funds. Golda is enormously successful generating pledges of some $50 million. Her talk in Chicago is often referred to as “the speech that made possible a Jewish state.” David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first leader, would comment that when the history of Israel is written it will say, “there was a Jewish woman who got the money to make the state possible.” While in New York, Golda’s taxi is in an accident and she emerges with a badly fractured leg. Golda also arrives in Moscow as Israel’s first minister to the Soviet Union. While she receives much acclaim, she is not happy about leaving Israel at this time. But she writes, “One’s duty was one duty – and it had nothing to do with justice.” This idea of duty is a constant theme throughout her life. When she gets a passport from now independent Israel, according to several sources, she turns back her American passport. She, however, never turns her back on her positive experience with American democracy and freedom.

1949: Golda is elected to the first Knesset (Israel’s Parliament) from the Mapai party which organizes the government. Prime Minister Ben-Gurion invites her to be Deputy Prime Minister. She declines and is named Minister of Labor (sus). Despite her qualifications, there are members of the religious block who are not happy with the appointment of a woman to the position.

1955: She is asked by Ben-Gurion to run for mayor of Tel Aviv. Though reluctant, she takes on the task. She does not receive a majority vote from the city council. Her selection depended on the votes of two men from the religious block and one of them simply refused to support a woman. Golda (who is not particularly religious) continues as Minister of Labor until 1956.

1956-1966: Foreign Minister.

The movie 'A Woman named Golda' (1981 sus) depicts a scene in 1957 where Golda jumps in front of a grenade to save Ben Gurion's life during a parliment session despite having no known military or weapons training.

1969: Early in the year, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol dies. There is serious disagreement over his successor. Given the struggle between Yigal Allon and Moshe Dayan for the position, Golda is seen as the only person who can hold things together. Faced with the view that “Golda must come back,” she accepts the nomination for the post by the central committee of her party on March 7 and becomes Prime Minister on March 17, seven weeks before her 71st birthday. She is the fourth person to hold the position and she remains in office for just over five years. Her early years are marked by enormously high approval ratings.

1975: Golda, now a private citizen, publishes her autobiography My Life. During negotiations with British publisher George Weidenfeld, she says, “I will not write about my private life. I will not settle political or other scores with anyone. I will not take advantage of the high office have just left, or of anything I learned there.” While the book remained well within those guidelines, it still became an international best seller. Rinna Samuels works with her on writing the book. And, according to publisher Weidenfeld, during the process of producing the book Golda would say, “I need this book like a hole in my head. I hate indiscretion. I hate memoirs.”

1978: Dies in Jerusalem.

> “I decided to explore how Golda, the most successful Israeli politician of the 20th century and the fourth and only woman prime minister, functioned between the myth of equality and the reality of
> misogyny,” Lahav told the Journal. The title is both a play on the famous statement, attributed to David Ben Gurion, that Golda was ‘the only man in the room,’ and a tip of the hat to the fact that
> Golda surrounded herself with men. She made sure she was indeed the only woman in her political room. [“The Only Woman in the Room: Golda Meir and Her Path to Power,”](https://jewishjournal.org/2023/03/16/author-to-tell-golda-meirs-story-through-feminist-lens-at-jccns/)

In an article to mark the 30th anniversary of the October war, a headline in the Egyptian paper Sabah al-Kheir announced: "Golda Meir was a lesbian." 

## My Notes:

How could a woman (with no military experience) rise to power in a society that forbids authority to women and yet be so instrumental in the creation of Israel?
Was her real birth certificate lost when the family had to use false names (Mabovitch) to travel to America?
Could Golda have been influenced by Milwaukee's pioneering LGBT scene between the ages of 8 to 14? 
Could transexualism be the reason she ran away from home?
Did british agents find her in a communist kibbutz living full time as a woman - and set her up to infiltrate the highest level of prude phallocentric Abrahamic society?
Did they arrest all the 'male leaders' of the Jewish Agency on purpose - to elevate Golda's authority above her patriarchal political opponents?
Did they send her on secret missions to arab countries because they knew the arabs wouldn't look under her dress?
After being so instrumental in the creation of Israel, why did she say, 
“I will not write about my private life... I need this book like a hole in my head. I hate indiscretion. I hate memoirs.”?
Surely a woman who helped create and then save her country (multiple times) would have some private life wisdom for the millions of Israeli girls who would follow her ambitions. 
What really prompted Israel’s founder and first prime minister to referred to Golda as simply [“the best man in the government.”](https://www.history.com/articles/golda-meir-israel-prime-minister-iron-lady-yom-kippur-war)? 
Did Ben Gurion know? 

## Further context
Before the British partitioned Palestine, they also set up apartheid in many other places like India (1947 Partition), Bengal, Ireland, South Africa etc. 
The British Empire reached it's peak in the years 1922-1923.
Afterwards, as the *Commonwealth of Nations* began to decline and lose territory, it left behind a divided and conquered people split along the social, religious, and racial apartheid it had originally imposed upon the indigenous. 
The colonies of France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, and Italy did precisely the same thing.
Instead if simply leaving, each declining empire set in motion a lasting legacy of civil war and bloodshed within every colony it pulled out of militarily. 
This tactic (Neocolonialism) allowed these countries to maintain control of their former colonies, even after their formal independence, through various economic, political, and cultural means.
Israel was no exception. The British Mandate for Palestine, a period of British administration in the region, officially lasted from 1923 to 1948, 
and ended with the Balfour Declaration, which called for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, 
while also stating that "nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine"

Had cooler heads prevailed, Palestine would have formed an independent republic welcoming of all religions - maintaining a precedent that had existed unbroken already for thousands of years.
Instead, increased religious tensions led slowly and painfully to the [Nakba](https://www.un.org/unispal/about-the-nakba/). 
Reasons for palestinian expulsion include direct expulsions by Israeli forces, destruction of Arab villages, 
psychological warfare including terrorism, dozens of massacres which caused many to flee out of fear, 
such as the widely publicized Deir Yassin massacre, crop burning, typhoid epidemics in some areas caused by Israeli well-poisoning,
and the collapse of Palestinian leadership including the demoralizing impact of wealthier classes fleeing.
Many historians consider that the events of 1948 were an instance of ethnic cleansing [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight).
