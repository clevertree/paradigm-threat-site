[**Biological Conflict**](#Bronchial_Mucosa_BC)[**Conflict-Active Phase**](#Bronchial_Mucosa_CA)[**Healing Phase
**](#Bronchial_Mucosa_PCL)

**DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION OF THE BRONCHIAL MUCOSA:** The bronchial tubes branch from the [trachea](#Trachea_Top) into
two main bronchi from where they subdivide inside each lung into numerous small ducts, called bronchioles. The main
function of the bronchi and bronchioles is to carry air into the [lung alveoli](#Lung_Alveoli_Top), where oxygen and
carbon dioxide are exchanged during respiration. The bronchial mucosa consists
of [squamous epithelium](../documents/embryonic_development.html#ED_Squamous_Epithelium_OSP_Epidermis), originates from
the [ectoderm](../documents/embryonic_development.html#ED_Squamous_Epithelium) and is therefore controlled from the
cerebral cortex.

[![](M_Bronchial_Mucosa_Cortex_EN.jpg)](../extimages/M_Bronchial_Mucosa_Cortex_EN.jpg "::Click to enlarge this image")

**BRAIN LEVEL:** The bronchial mucosa of both lungs is controlled from the right **temporal lobe** (part of the *
*sensory cortex)**. The control center is positioned exactly across from the brain relay of
the [laryngeal mucosa](../documents/larynx.html#Larynx_Mucosa_Top).

   

**BIOLOGICAL CONFLICT:** The [biological conflict](https://learninggnm.com/SBS/documents/five_laws.html#First_BL) linked
to the bronchial mucosa is a **male** **territorial fear conflict** or female [**scare-fright conflict
**](../documents/larynx.html#Larynx_Mucosa_BC), depending on a
person’s [gender, laterality, and hormone status](../documents/five_laws.html#First_BL_GLH) (see
also [Flying Constellation](https://learninggnm.com/constellations/documents/flying_constellation.html#Flying_Constellation_Top)).
The male territorial fear conflict is the equivalent to the
female [nest-worry conflict](../documents/breast.html#Breast_Glands_BC). In fact,
originally, [Dr. Hamer](https://learninggnm.com/documents/hamerbio.html#Hamer_Biography_Top) termed the
bronchi-related [DHS](../documents/five_laws.html#Five_Biological_Laws) a “territorial-worry conflict”.

**\*With left-handers the conflict is transferred to the other brain hemisphere**

In line with evolutionary reasoning, **territorial conflicts**, **sexual conflicts**, and **separation conflicts** are
the primary conflict themes associated with organs
of [ectodermal](../documents/embryonic_development.html#ED_Squamous_Epithelium) origin, controlled from
the [sensory, pre-motor sensory and post-sensory cortex]( "::<img alt="" src="M_Cortex_Lateral_View_EN.jpg">").

A **territorial fear conflict** refers to a **threat to the “territory”**, a **fear within the “territory”** (at home,
at work, at school, at the playground, in kindergarten or daycare, in a seniors home, in the hospital, or in the
village, city, and country where one lives), and to a **fear regarding one’s own safety** as well as the safety of the
“pack”. Physical abuse, family violence, mobbing, bullying, an accident, fire or flooding, an acute medical condition, a
frightening diagnosis or prognosis, scary medical procedures, or hospitalization are a few examples of what can trigger
the conflict. Children suffer the conflict when they are punished, abused, or yelled at, when they are terrified of a
person or a situation, when they watch spooky films or videos showing monsters or vampires, or when they have
nightmares. An adult’s panic can also create a territorial fear in a child! Unborn children experience
the [conflict in the womb](../documents/understanding_genetic_diseases.html#Intra-uterine_Conflicts) when the mother is
in danger or at birth during a difficult delivery. The conflict could also concern a member of the “territory” (a fear
of losing a partner who secures a home or when a loved one is seriously ill, hospitalized, or diagnosed with cancer –
associated with a “fatal disease”). A territorial fear can be shared by people of large regions, for example, during a
natural disaster, during wartimes, or through scares of terrorist attacks or pandemic
fear-mongering ([AIDS](#Bronchia_Mucosa_PCL_AIDS), SARS, Swine Flu, and the like) by the media.

The [Biological Special Program](../documents/five_laws.html#First_BL) of the **bronchial mucosa** follows the [**OUTER
SKIN SENSITIVITY PATTERN**](../documents/embryonic_development.html#ED_Squamous_Epithelium_OSP_Epidermis) with
hyposensitivity during the conflict-active phase and the Epileptoid Crisis and hypersensitivity in the healing phase.

   

**CONFLICT-ACTIVE PHASE:** [ulceration in the bronchial mucosa]( "::<img alt="" src="M_COMPASS_GNM_EN.jpg">")
proportional to the degree and duration of conflict activity. The **biological purpose of the cell loss** is to widen
the respiratory passageways so that more air can reach the [lungs](#Lung_Alveoli_Top). The enhanced function of the
lungs serves to facilitate a conflict resolution. There are no symptoms in the conflict-active phase.

[![](M_CT_Bronchial_Mucosa_CA_EN.jpg)](../extimages/M_CT_Bronchial_Mucosa_CA_EN.jpg "::Click to enlarge this image")

This brain CT shows the impact of a [territorial fear conflict](#Bronchial_Mucosa_BC) in the area of the cerebral cortex
that controls the bronchial
mucosa ([view the GNM diagram](../extimages/M_Bronchial_Mucosa_Cortex_EN.jpg "::Click to view the GNM diagram")).
The [sharp border](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_CA_Brain) of
the [Hamer Focus](../documents/five_laws.html#First_BL_Hamer_Focus) reveals conflict activity.

   

**HEALING PHASE:** During the first part of
the [healing phase](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_PCL_A_Organ) ([PCL-A]( "::<img alt="" src="M_Two_Phase_Diagram_EN.jpg">"))
the tissue loss is replenished through **cell proliferation**. **Healing symptoms** are **pain** due to the swelling
caused by the [edema](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_PCL_A_Organ) (fluid accumulation), **tickles in the lungs
** (itching or pruritus is characteristic for any healing
involving [squamous epithelial tissue](../documents/embryonic_development.html#ED_Squamous_Epithelium_OSP_Epidermis)
such as the [skin](../documents/skin.html#Epidermis_Top)) **and coughing**. Coughing facilitates bringing up phlegm
containing remnants of the repair process. Depending on the intensity of the conflict, the symptoms range from mild to
severe. After the [Epileptoid Crisis](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_EC),
in [PCL-B]( "::<img alt="" src="M_Two_Phase_Diagram_EN.jpg">"), the swelling recedes and the function of the bronchi
returns to normal.

In conventional medicine, the cell proliferation that takes place
in [PCL-A]( "::<img alt="" src="M_Two_Phase_Diagram_EN.jpg">") is diagnosed as a **“lung cancer”** or **bronchial cancer
** (compare with [lung cancer](#Lung_Alveoli_CA) related to the [lung alveoli](#Lung_Alveoli_Top)). Based on
the [Five Biological Laws](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_PCL_A_Organ), the new cells cannot be regarded as
“cancer cells” since the cell increase is, in reality, a replenishing process.

[![](M_OrganCT_Bronchia_Atelectasis_cH_EN.jpg)](../extimages/M_OrganCT_Bronchia_Atelectasis_cH_EN.jpg "::Click to enlarge this image")

The swelling in a bronchial tube can block the air passages resulting in a bronchial **atelectasis**. On a lung X-ray,
the lung, void of air due to the obstruction, appears as white (see picture). After the Epileptoid Crisis, the bronchial
tube reopens accompanied by heavy coughs and sputum production. However, with
a [hanging healing](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_Hanging_Healing), when the repair process is continually
interrupted by [conflict relapses](#Second_BL_Hanging_Healing), the scar-buildup eventually hardens with the result that
the atelectasis remains (this is also referred to as **COPD-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease**). The bronchial
constriction causes permanent breathing difficulties, even after the healing phase has been completed.

According to [Dr. Hamer](https://learninggnm.com/documents/hamerbio.html#Hamer_Biography_Top), an atelectasis is often
misdiagnosed as a bronchial tumor.

**Bronchitis** occurs when healing is accompanied by an **inflammation**, typically with **fever**, **headaches**
because of the swelling in the corresponding brain relay, and **fatigue** since
the [autonomic nervous system](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL) is in a state of prolonged
rest ([vagotonia](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_PCL)). In conventional medicine, recurring bronchitis is
generally associated with “[allergies](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_Allergies)” (see
also [bronchial asthma](#Bronchial_Asthma)).

   

**Pneumonia is bronchitis with the** [**SYNDROME**](../documents/kidneys.html#KCT_Syndrome), that is,
with [water retention](../documents/kidneys.html#KCT_Water_Retention) as a result of an
active [abandonment or existence conflict](../documents/kidneys.html#KCT_BC) involving
the [kidney collecting tubules](../documents/kidneys.html#KCT_Top).
In [PCL-A]( "::<img alt="" src="M_Two_Phase_Diagram_EN.jpg">"),
the [retained water](../documents/kidneys.html#KCT_Water_Retention) is exceedingly stored in the bronchial tubes (
compare with [lung edema](#Lung_Alveoli_Edema_Emphysema)). On the brain level, the excess water could lead to serious
complications, particularly during the [Epileptoid Crisis](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_EC), which is the
critical point (“pneumonic lysis”) when the [brain edema](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_PCL_A_Brain) is
expelled. The brain pressure caused by the sympathicotonic surge could be so strong that the person falls into a coma
and dies. However, if the [conflict-active phase](#Bronchial_Mucosa_CA) lasted less than 4-5 months, the Epi-Crisis is,
according to [Dr. Hamer](https://learninggnm.com/documents/hamerbio.html), not life-threatening.

**NOTE:** All [Epileptoid Crises](../documents/five_laws.html#Second_BL_EC) that are controlled from
the [sensory, post-sensory, or pre-motor sensory cortex]( "::<img alt="" src="M_Cortex_Lateral_View_EN.jpg">") []( "::<img alt="" src="M_Cortex_Lateral_View.jpg">")
are accompanied by **troubled circulation**, **dizzy spells**, short **disturbances of consciousness** or a complete *
*loss of consciousness** (fainting or “absence”), depending on the intensity of the conflict. Another distinctive
symptom is a **drop of blood sugar** caused by the excessive use of glucose by the brain cells (compare
with [hypoglycemia](../documents/pancreas.html#Alpha_Islet_Cells_CA) related to
the [islet cells of the pancreas](../documents/pancreas.html#Pancreas_Islet_Cells_Top)).

So-called **Legionnaires’ disease** is a type of pneumonia. The name originates from an outbreak of pneumonia among
people who had attended a convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia in 1976. What was possibly
the [territorial fear conflict](#Bronchial_Mucosa_BC) experienced by so many participants of the meeting?

**“Bacterial pneumonia”** indicates that the repair and scarring
process ([PCL-B]( "::<img alt="" src="M_Two_Phase_Diagram_EN.jpg">")) is assisted
by [bacteria](../documents/five_laws.html#Fourth_BL_Bacteria). This is usually the case when the ulceration that takes
place in the [conflict-active phase](#Bronchial_Mucosa_CA) reaches deep into the bronchial tissue.

Conventional medicine claims that **“viral pneumonia”** is caused
by [viruses](../documents/five_laws.html#Fourth_BL_Viruses), notably by influenza viruses that purportedly caused the *
*Spanish Flu pandemic** after the First World War or, in our days, SARS, the Bird Flu, the Swine Flu, and the like.
However, none of the [influenza viruses]( "::<img alt="" src="Virus_Mania_Cover.jpg">") have ever been scientifically
verified (details are presented in
the [“Virus Mania” GNM video](https://learninggnm.com/documents/videos.html)). [Threats of a global “influenza pandemic]( "::<img alt="" src="M_Pneumonia_Epidemic.jpg">")”,
however, can trigger [territorial fear](#Bronchial_Mucosa_BC)
and [existence conflicts](../documents/kidneys.html#KCT_BC) among the population resulting in a fast increase of *
*influenza** cases.

[![](M_Spanish_Flu_Pandemic_Graph_EN.jpg)](../extimages/M_Spanish_Flu_Pandemic_Graph_EN.jpg "::Click to enlarge this image")

These statistics of the Spanish Flu pandemic show that the outbreak started at the beginning of October 1918 reaching
its height 3-4 weeks later. According to historical records, Germany asked the Allies for a ceasefire on October 4th,
1918 (the official date of the end of the First World War is November 11, 1918).

With the prospect of peace, millions of people worldwide went into healing
of [territorial fear conflicts](#Bronchial_Mucosa_BC) they had suffered during four years of war (see
also [lung tuberculosis epidemic of 1918/19](#Lung_Alveoli_PCL)).

Pneumonia is also the most common lung condition associated
with [HIV]( "::<img alt="" src="HIV_Kary_Mullis_Text_EN.jpg">") and **AIDS**. As we now come to understand, there is no
causal relation at all to the alleged HI-Virus []( "::"If there is evidence that HIV causes AIDS, there should be
scientific documents which either singly or collectively demonstrate that fact, at least with a high probability. There
is no such document."- Dr. Kary Mullis, Nobel Prize Laureate for Chemistry 1993")but rather to a “territorial fear”
or [scare-fright conflict](../documents/larynx.html#Larynx_Mucosa_BC) associated with the “disease”.

   

**AIDS-Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome**

“If there is evidence that HIV causes AIDS, there should be scientific documents which either singly or collectively
demonstrate that fact, at least with a high probability. There is no such document” (Dr. Kary Mullis, Nobel Prize
Laureate for Chemistry 1993).

“Up to today, there is no single scientifically convincing evidence for the existence of HIV. Not even one such
retrovirus has been isolated and purified by the methods of classical virology” (Dr. Heinz Ludwig Sanger, Emeritus
Professor for Molecular Biology and Virology, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Munich).

In 1983, the American researcher Robert Gallo claimed that he had discovered the “human immunodeficiency virus” (HIV) as
the agent responsible for the cause of AIDS. In 1984, Gallo published four articles in _Science_, in which he stated
that he had isolated the HIV virus. In December 2008, thirty-seven legal, medical and research professionals sent a
letter to the journal, asking it to officially retract the original four papers that made the case for HIV as the cause
of AIDS. According to the authors, widespread evidence had emerged that Gallo’s studies were not only poorly carried
out, but that their results were falsified. The letter from the 37 experts includes a letter from Gallo himself,
admitting to another researcher that HIV could not be isolated from human samples alone. In addition, a letter from an
electron microscopy expert revealed that there was no HIV virus contained in Gallo's 1984 samples.

**Dr. Hamer**: “The ‘AIDS’ symptoms are the result of the invention of AIDS.”

Based on the understanding of the [Five Biological Laws](../documents/five_laws.html#Five_Biological_Laws), most of the
“AIDS” symptoms are caused by the diagnosis shock and
of [biological conflicts](https://learninggnm.com/SBS/documents/five_laws.html#First_BL) triggered by the fear of the
disease. Here are a few examples:

* [death-fright conflict](#Lung_Alveoli_BC) involving
  the [lungs](#Lung_Alveoli_Top) ([lung tuberculosis](#Lung_Alveoli_PCL), [lung emphysema](#Lung_Alveoli_Edema_Emphysema))


* [scare-fright conflicts](../documents/larynx.html#Larynx_Mucosa_BC) resulting in respiratory symptoms such
  as [bronchitis](#Bronchial_Mucosa_PCL) or [pneumonia](#Bronchia_Mucosa_PCL_Pneumonia)


* [frontal-fear conflicts](../documents/pharyngeal_ducts.html#Pharyngeal_Ducts_BC) ([non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma](../documents/pharyngeal_ducts.html#Pharyngeal_Ducts_PCL))


* [abandonment or existence conflicts](../documents/kidneys.html#KCT_BC) ([kidney cancer](../documents/kidneys.html#KCT_Parameters))


* [self-devaluation conflicts](../documents/bones.html#Bones_BC) ([anemia](../documents/bones.html#Anemia_Leukemia_CA), [leukemia](../documents/bones.html#Leukemia_PCL), [bone cancer](../documents/bones.html#Bone_Cancer_Osteosarcoma), [lymphoma](../documents/lymph_system.html#Lymphoma))


*
a[ttack or “feeling soiled” conflicts](../documents/skin.html#Corium_Skin_BC) ([shingles](../documents/skin.html#Corium_Shingles), [Kaposi sarcoma](../documents/skin.html#Corium_Kaposi))


* [territorial anger conflicts](../documents/liver.html#Bile_Ducts_BC) ([hepatitis](../documents/liver.html#Bile_Ducts_Hepatitis))


* [separation conflicts](../documents/skin.html#Epidermis_BC) ([skin rashes](../documents/skin.html#Epidermis_PCL), [herpes](../documents/skin.html#Epidermis_Herpes))


* [bleeding conflicts](../documents/lymph_system.html#Spleen_BC) triggered by blood tests leading to
  an [enlarged spleen](../documents/lymph_system.html#Spleen_PCL)

**NOTE:** Usually, a rise in antibodies is considered a sign of a
“strong [immune system](../documents/five_laws.html#Fourth_BL_Immune_System)”. But not when it comes to AIDS. In HIV
tests, the presence of antibodies is considered an indication that the person is “seropositive”, in other words,
“infected” with the “Human Immuno _Deficiency_ Virus”!
