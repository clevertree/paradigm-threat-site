## ELECTRICITY THROUGHOUT THE BODY.

Healthy Cells = -30mV. Cancer = +30mV.

"Cells are designed to run between a pH of 7.35 and 7.45.

"We doctors are trained to pay particular attention to things that are abnormally high. For example we watch carefully
for high blood sugar (diabetes), however, we rarely think about hypoglycemia unless a patient is dizzy or faint. We
watch carefully for a high temperature including fever, but we are not trained that a low temperature indicated
hypothyroidism. We watch carefully for high blood pressure and are insensitive to the fact that low blood pressure due
to over-exuberant prescription of medications is causing our patients to be dizzy. We rarely look at pH levels or oxygen
levels unless the patient is in intensive care.

"I want to focus on the importance of pH. When I was trying to figure out how to get well, I couldn’t remember a lot
about pH. I remembered that it was something about acid/base balance but I knew very little more than that. So I began
to read about pH. What I discovered is that pH (shorthand for potential hydrogen) is really the measurement of
voltage. (see article #1)

"When electrons are running through a conductor like a copper wire, they are there or not. If the switch is on, you have
an electron donor. If the switch is off, there are no electrons.

"However, a solution provides a different situation. The solution may be an electron donor or an electron stealer. One
measures the voltage of a solution with a sophisticated voltmeter. By convention, if the solution is an electron donor,
one puts a minus (-) sign in front of the voltage. If, however, the solution is an electron stealer, one put a plus (+)
in front of the voltage. For example, if your pH voltmeter measures +150 millivolts, that means the solution is an
electron stealer with 150 millivolts of stealing power. If your pH voltmeter measures -200 millivolts, it means that the
solution is an electron donor with 200 millivolts of donating power.

"After measuring the voltage of a solution, one can convert that into a logarithmic scale called pH. A voltage of +400
mV is the same as a pH of zero. A voltage of -400 mV is the same as a pH of 14. A solution that is neither an electron
donor nor an electron stealer is called a pH of seven.

## pH scale vs. voltage

"With this understanding, one can see that a pH of 7.35 is the same as a voltage of -20 mV. A pH of 7.45 is the same as
a voltage of -25 mV. Thus we see that all cellular biology texts tell us that cells are designed to run between -20 and
-25 millivolts of electron donor status!

Electron stealers cause damage, are a pH of 0 to 6.9, are acidic, are free radicals, are the positive pole, are
destructive and at the atomic level spin left.

You will hear statements like "all disease occurs when you are acidic”. What this is really saying is that all disease
occurs when your voltage is low or in an electron stealer state. The phrase “alkalize or die” means is that you must
have electrons available to do work or your cells will die.

A free radical is a molecule that is missing electrons. It is like a mugger looking for someone’s purse to steal. When a
free radical steals electrons from the cell, it damages the cell.

An antioxidant is a molecule capable of giving away electrons. Thus, when your mother says “ eat your vegetables “ she
is saying that the vegetables contain electrons that are good for you.

We maintain our health and heal primarily by making new cells. To make new cells requires a voltage of -50 mV

Salivary and urinary pH are about 0.8 pH units less than cell pH. Salivary pH is a rough indicator of cellular voltage.
Urinary pH is a rough indicator of the voltage I the fluids around cells. When normal, both should be 6.5. If you add
0.8 to 6.5 you get a pH of 7.3. This equates to -20 millivolts.
Now let’s consider my thumb. My thumb is running at a voltage of -25 mV. It is pink, feels fine and works well. Now I
hit it with a hammer. The thumb turns red, swollen, is hot and has a pulsing pain. It has automatically gone to -50 mV.
This is necessary to make new cells needed to replace the ones I damaged with a hammer. At -50 mV, blood vessels dilate
and dump raw materials such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats vitamins, minerals, etc. into the neighborhood. I need
these raw materials to build new cells. I also need -50 mV to have the energy to turn these raw materials into new
cells.

As soon as I finish making enough cells to replace those I damaged with the hammer, my thumb goes back to -25 mV. It is
normal and I am happy.

Now let’s assume that I ran out of voltage before I was able to make enough new cells to replace those that I injured
with a hammer. My voltage dropped to -10 mV. Now I am stuck in chronic disease. I cannot heal unless I can make new
cells. I cannot make new cells unless I have -50 mV and all the raw materials I need to make new cells. In chronic
disease, my thumb huts all the time, it is white and doesn’t work very well.

Thus we see that chronic disease is always defined as having low voltage. One cannot cure chronic disease without
inserting enough electrons to achieve -50 mV. One must also have the raw materials necessary to make new cells and to
eliminate the toxins or infections present that will damage the new cells. One can take all the medications you like and
do as much surgery as you like, but you will not heal unless you have -50 mV, raw materials and lack of toxins.

Without the ability to achieve -50 mV and the necessary raw materials to make new cells, you cannot maintain your health
and you suffer aging and chronic disease. You are also unable to repair injuries that can also lead to chronic disease.
You don’t need drugs to heal. You need to make new cells that work to heal. To make good cells you need voltage and a
good diet. You also need to remove toxins from your body that damage cells and make you obese.

Once one begins to understand that chronic disease and healing are controlled by voltage, one must ask the following
questions:

* How do cells normally get voltage?
* How do cells store voltage?
* Why did my voltage drop to allow me to get sick?
* How do I measure voltage of organs?
* What do I do when I find the voltage is low?
