## In reality there was no person like Abraham. 

His life is based on the Zodiac constellations, but even if you don't believe that - 
his story is nonetheless justification for the persistence of the cult of penis cutting i.e. Monotheism 
that has lasted well into the present. 
Again, even if you believe God wants you to cut your boy's penis so many thousands of years later after the Covenant - 
you still have to explain the following contradiction - 

If the Penis-cutting Abrahamic Covenant was a promise of land and posterity to those within the cult 
who cut the genitalia of their boys (and girls too in many cases) - 
then wasn't that Covenant broken when those in the cult rejected the ways of God 
and worshiped say Baal or Polytheism? Or when the Jews lost the land of Israel that god gave them? More than twice? 
Or - Why do you persist on cutting the penises, when you really aren't sure 
if the Covenant is still in effect, having been broken so many times? Should you not err on the side of caution? 

For many Monotheistic parents today who put God before their own children, this story is a test of faith.
Would they kill their own child if ordered to do so by God himself?
The cutting at birth is a fulfilment of that faith - a symbol of their promise to that invisible God that - yes - they would kill their own children.

## The Apostle Paul and the "Circumcision Party" in the Bible

The Apostle Paul, particularly in his letter to the Galatians and also in Philippians, warns against a group he calls the "circumcision" or those who advocate for circumcision as a requirement for salvation. 

Key Points:
Galatians & Judaizers: Paul's letter to the Galatians directly addresses the influence of the "Judaizers," who insisted that Gentile converts to Christianity needed to be circumcised and follow Jewish law in order to be truly saved.
Salvation by Grace: Paul strongly opposed this view, arguing that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone, not through adherence to the law or circumcision.
Emphasis on Faith: Paul emphasizes that true circumcision is not physical but spiritual, a circumcision of the heart by the Holy Spirit, as highlighted in Romans 2:28-29.
Strong Condemnation: Paul condemns those who promote circumcision as a necessary step for salvation, stating that if the Galatians accept circumcision, Christ will be of no value to them (Galatians 5:2-4).
Philippians & Warning Against Legalism: In Philippians 3:2, Paul cautions against those who "mutilate the flesh," referring to the Judaizers' emphasis on physical circumcision, highlighting the dangers of legalism. 

Galatians 5:2â€“4
```
2 Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
3 Once again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law.
4 You who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.
