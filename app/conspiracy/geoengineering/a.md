"In January of this year, a report was published on the website of a nonprofit named Avaaz. The report claimed that
YouTube is profiting off of videos that deny the reality of climate change. It further lists major advertisers who run
ads on videos that question the legitimacy of the threat that climate change poses to humanity. Since that report was
posted, several media outlets- Vice, Time, and The Verge among them- have called for putting pressure on advertisers who
would dare advertise on any of these videos. In short, they must be punished for not toeing the correct ideological
line.

"Put another way, independent mainstream media outlets are now engaged in a politically-motivated campaign for YouTube
to demonetize any video that questions the legitimacy of climate change. Leaving aside one’s feelings about that
legitimacy, this is the new censorship in the digital age. Of course, Avaaz denies censorship is involved. They claim
that YouTube is not being asked to take down any video. Giving them the benefit of the doubt- a huge doubt- it is still
an indirect method of removing “wrongthink.”

"Thus far, YouTube has questioned the methodology of the Avaaz study. However, there are powerful activists behind this
move and they are starting to target advertisers like Uber, Nintendo, Red Bull, and Warner Brothers. One can rest
assured that if YouTube’s bottom line is affected, they will fold. Already, Samsung has contacted YouTube to “resolve
the issue” to avoid a “repetition in the future.” Not only in the crosshairs are independent video makers, but also
mainstream news outlets like Fox News which have content on YouTube questioning the validity of climate change.

"Avaaz wants us to fall in line with the MSM and their dire warnings about climate change. After all, Australia is
burning, right? The simple fact is, the MSM is not exactly up to snuff on news. When one thinks of it, the MSM is
perhaps the biggest purveyors of fake news. Two examples: coverage of the Covington school kids and, of course, the
Russian collusion hoax.

"The proponents of George Soros will tell you he is not behind this at all. They say that Avaaz is primarily
member-funded. However, there is no denial that Soros, through his nebulous network of groups, provided the seed money
for Avaaz to exist in the first place, along with MoveOn.org and SEIU. Various prominent figures from the Soros group,
Open Society Foundation, have been listed among the leadership of the organization.

"This campaign underscores the whole problem with climate change. If manmade climate change were an immutable fact,
there would be no need for censorship. The consensus would be that these videos being targeted were the creations of
conspiracy theorists and fanciful thinkers. People would watch them, laugh and move on. But, that is not the case. There
is no denying that claims about climate change have been repeatedly proven false. Little is set in stone, if anything.

"Thus, any content that lands on either side of the debate should not be thrown in the memory hole. The creators of
videos who question the so-called conventional wisdom and the oft-repeated “consensus view” should not be silenced by
the dictates of one of the world’s richest men and his many proxies. Why the need for a billionaire and Avaaz to play
the role of babysitter over Internet video content? What is it they do not want us to see, hear, and question? Could it,
perhaps, be that their ideas, beliefs, and solutions are weak from the start?
