## Testimony of apocalyptic comet

1. [December 16, 1811, Caracas, Venezuela was also destroyed](https://archaeologica.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3796).
Find accounts of the many disasters associated with the close passing of a comet at “Travels to the equinoctial
regions of America”, chapter 14, by Alexander Von Humboldt, as this was more than seismic activity throughout the
central United States but was a global catastrophe.

## Cultural testimony

1. Book of Mormon \
Salt Lake City Temple survived the MudFlood covered very
high [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eViJmOFjxN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eViJmOFjxN8) \

## Return of Slavery

1. [The MAAFA](http://nationaljuneteenth.com/Maafa.html) is a Kiswahili term for "terrible occurrence" or "great
disaster". It refers to the Black Holocaust when millions of Africans died allegedly during the journey of captivity
from the west coast of Africa to the shores of America. This memory may instead be the world war of 1812 and the
subsequent return of slavery afterward. French Race Census became illegal starting FR of 1789. Revolution concepts
like universal suffrage, abolition of slavery, and citizenship promoted Afro-French immigration. Thomas-Alexandre
Dumas became France’s first black general in 1793.  \
Between 1807 and 1860, the Royal Navy's ‘suppression’ Squadron seized thousands of free ships of the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans and sold them (slavery was banned) to the Portuguese-run TransAtlantic Slave Trade. During this time,
the British navy relocated 150,000 Africans from the French empire to the British colony of Sierra Leone to work in
Sugar Plantations.
2. Michael Mann, basing his figures on those provided by Justin McCarthy, states that between 1821 and 1922, a large
number of Muslims were expelled from Southeast Europe as Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia declared independence. Mann
describes these events as "murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe".

## Negative Lightning scar

8. Not appearing on old maps i.e. 1688
9. Rio Grande dried up 1890
10. Water was redirected west through Grand Junction creating the ‘Colorado River’
11. Local population redacted into ‘Sinagua’ (without water) and ‘Hopi’ (obedient). Montezuma’s Castle may be fake, (
which is harder to prove)

20. Rain covers up old scars. Desert preservesPositive Lightning Scars
21. Sand Deserts and Dunes result of negative scarring
22. from the MudFlood?
23. Found on Mars
24. The majority of the sandy shorelines in marine protected areas are eroding, raising cause for serious concern
25. Waikiki has seen so much erosion that over the past century they have had to import sand. taking sand from the
beach is now illegal in Hawaii
26. Alternate Theories
27. Old Seabed
28. weathering bedrock
29. River rocks
30. Mesas and Melted Mountains
31. Yet Shiprock itself, and a number of similar formations are well removed from those volcanic fields, standing
alone on the high desert plains. They are attributed to an ancient volcanic complex called the Navajo Volcanic
Field but are not surrounded by lava flows, ash deposits, or any other features provably volcanic in origin
32. Mars mesa and knobs are separated by flat lying lowlands. They are thought to form from ice-facilitated mass
wasting processes from ground or atmospheric sources
33. [India Map](https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/62761/asiae-novissima-tabula-de-jode) Changed
34. River changed direction
35. No Himilayan Mountains
36. No Ganges River (3rd largest river on Earth)
37. [Another Map](https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/65841/asia-partium-orbis-maxima-de-jode) with no Ganges
river or Himilayans
38. Largest rivers no longer end at Gulf of Kutch

39. Grand canyon's Appalachian Sand mystery.
it is a well-established fact that significant portions of the sand
that makes up the Grand Canyon originated in the Appalachian Mountains.
Specifically, Navajo Sandstone, a prominent rock formation within the canyon,
has been linked to the ancient Appalachian Mountains as its source.
https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/nature/sand-source.htm#:~:text=These%20tiny%2C%20rare%20grains%20of%20zircon%20have,desert%20winds%20to%20the%20Colorado%20Plateau%20region.&text=Sediment%20eroded%20from%20these%20mountains%20was%20transported%20by%20ancient%20rivers%20toward%20the%20western%20coastline.

However, the idea of sand moving that far and ending up in the GC is ludicrous.
Instead, we should consider that the sand making up the Appalachian Mountains
**is in fact the same sand removed from the Grand Canyon** in the
MudFlood Energetic Event.

## Positive Scarring - Colorado Rocky Mountains

Statue of Liberty). British wanted to prevent. \
Built by machine, Suez flooded the Nile starting 1869
until [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile). \
Nile is only river flowing north in the world, but it also flows south in Sudan for 200 miles.
13. Masada - mesa
14. ‘Massah’ means ‘Testing’.
15. Jerusalem Mudflood - In recent months remains of an impressive building from the Hasmonean period (second
century BCE) are being unearthed in excavations the Israel Antiquities Authority is directing in the Givati
parking lot, located in the City of David in the Walls Around Jerusalem National
Park. [https://www.biblewalks.com/Givati](https://www.biblewalks.com/Givati)
16. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of
the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of
a "step-over" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent
subsidence.
17. Appears in fake older maps
18. Melted Buildings
19. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV6VloeMypk&list=UUIZoTgebXiFVoyqnXyS7GoA&index=31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV6VloeMypk&list=UUIZoTgebXiFVoyqnXyS7GoA&index=31)

24. Asia
25. No Himilaya Mountains. River used to
be [different](https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/62761/asiae-novissima-tabula-de-jode)
26. Great Wall built on positive scars
27. None of the Europeans who visited China or Mongolia in the 13th and 14th centuries, such as Giovanni da Pian
del Carpine, William of Rubruck, Marco Polo, Odoric of Pordenone and Giovanni de' Marignolli, mentioned the
Great Wall.
28. While portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated,
in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build
houses and roads

## End of Piracy

1. European and American piracy ended between 1710 and 1730, but the prosperity of the Barbary pirates continued until
the early 19th century.
2. Asian Pirates in the 18th and 19th century

## Continental Changes

1. Island of California?
2. North region incognita (Spanish for ‘unknown’)
3. Break up of Mu
4. Not a continent, a collection of Pacific Ocean ‘free lands’ that became classified. The British received them
only in the middle of the 18th century, after the capture of Manila as part of the Seven Years War.
5. Expanding Earth model shows huge ocean in Pacific
6. French Indochina, French Polynesia, and other Pacific “Pirate” Islands may have been targeted by the D.E.W. for
being allies with N
7. lemur fossils being found in both Madagascar and India, but not in Africa or the Middle East

## Orphan Trains

1. [https://youtu.be/DP0qV2DN3mo?t=378](https://youtu.be/DP0qV2DN3mo?t=378)
2. According to the museum’s website, the Orphan Train Movement transported around 250,000 needy, neglected, and
orphaned children from New York to other regions of the United States and Canada
from [1854 to 1929](https://vitabrevis.americanancestors.org/2015/10/orphan-trains/).
3. In 1850 the U.S. population was twenty-three million. By 1880 it had more
than [doubled](https://hometownbyhandlebar.com/?p=32125).
4. The mid-1800s wasn’t a good time to be a kid in New York City. Mud and excrement puddled in the streets. Children and
adults slept in sagging, damp shacks. Dirty homes, dirty roads, dirty clothes, and modern sanitation waited decades
away. Only the luckiest of these immigrants escaped, since few businesses paid this first wave of American
immigrants—mostly Irish, British, and German—a living wage. From 1854 to 1929, these trains, sponsored either by
government funding or sponsorship by wealthy philanthropists, sent roughly 200,000 children to the Midwest (with most
to Indiana in the first decade). Applications were accepted from virtually any area except those in slave-owning
southern states to preserve the race-based plantation system 30 degrees to the equator. \
One veteran of the orphan train, a Missouri Orphan Train veteran described her foster parents in clear terms: “They
weren't meant, they were cold, and they showed no feeling toward me. When I was 15 or 16 I decided I’d live in a
garbage can before I’d stay there any longer.” \

## Resettable cities across the planet today

1. [Victorian-style Architecture](https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/victorian-architecture) may be

## “Advanced” usury technology

## Will there be another MF?

No.

## Alternate Theories

1. Hydraulic mining
2. Unrelated Disasters
3. Dust Bowl (cover up)
4. Tunguska Event
5. Other Energetic Event that's not caused by a D.E.W.
6. Meteor Strikes
7. [Great Blizzard of 1888](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blizzard_of_1888)
8. Nuclear war
9. Buildings damaged to make new buildings
10. Great Wall of China
11. Colosseum of Rome,Italy

## Hypothesis Checklist

1. Falsifiability - Hypothesis is wrong if
2. Another energy source to explain the movement of mud
3. Another explanation for MudFlood buildings
4. A collection of unrelated disasters can explain the MudFlood
5. Another explanation for Melted Buildings and fortresses found world-wide
6. Napoleon legitimately failed to invade Moscow in 1812
7. Life on Mars can be disproven
8. If recently created locations like Australia, Israel, China, India, or the Grand Canyon have a history before
1776/1812
9. Parsimony “Occam’s Razor” - Hypothesis excessive if
10. A simpler explanation for - MudFlood / melted buildings, the added Grand canyon or break up of Mu continent, and
the reset of civilization - than a space laser on Mars targeting geopolitical enemies on Earth.
11. Scope & Fruitfulness
12. By limiting the scope of this event to our solar system affairs, we can predict that this event is not repeatable
and will never happen again
13. Conservatism
14. The conclusion of this hypothesis does not “fit” with any modern knowledge-systems, and instead suggests that
academia as we know it is little more than an elaborate system of control meant to obfuscate any and all truth.

## Misc:

Predictive Programming in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.
Hayao Miyazaki's #1 best anime features a post-mudflood apocalyptic world, poisoned topsoil world-wide, a prophecy  of a saviour and "promised" land after wandering in the desert, and Earth destroyed by human made weapon. This is yet another example of Revelation-Of-The-Method predictive programming driven by a MudFlood narrative and thus providing many clues as to the unredacted true story behind it.

## Controlled Opposition Agents

<PopImage {...require("./mudflood_buried_russian_winter_palace_deepfake.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Controlled Opposition Deep Fake by
KorbenDallas from StolenHistory.net"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

For years now, the MudFlood topic has been dominated by controlled opposition agents like the admins at
stolenhistory.org or Flat-Earthers like Philipp Druzhinin. You’ll find that when approaching the actual truth of any
conspiracy theory, you **will** encounter a series of corporate-funded gate-keepers attempting to lure you off the path
of your investigation - and into controlled opposition conclusions; New Age movements like 5D, Flat Earth, Fetus-looking
Ancient Aliens, or invisible Gods. Keep an open mind, Inspector - and happy investigating!
