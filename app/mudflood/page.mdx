The MudFlood Energetic Event Hypothesis proposes a solution to the mystery of the world-wide ‘Mud Flood’ event and its
alleged cover-up while attempting to answer
the [Journalistic Six](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/the-journalistic-six):
**Who** it happened to, **What** happened, **When, Where, Why,** and **How** did it happen?

## What is the MudFlood Theory?

Proponents of the *MudFlood Theory* compare photographs, maps, and testimonies which suggest that in the late 18th
century an unexplained world-wide *mud-rain* event abruptly and permanently raised the ground level around existing
cathedrals, pyramids, and other monuments - burying entire civilizations across the earth. Additionally, during this
time [maps of America](https://www.amazon.com/Issues-Maps-18th-century-History/dp/1549802968)
and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartary) changed significantly. During
many [world-wide excavations](https://www.sciencefocus.com/planet-earth/why-do-we-have-to-dig-so-deep-to-uncover-ancient-ruins/)
of buried cities, no satisfying explanation is ever given as to **how** they got buried in the first place.
Did foundations sink into the ground as a result of [liquefaction](https://www.scienceworld.ca/resource/liquefaction/)?
If
so, why aren't the buildings tilted, like the
[Tower of Pisa](https://www.history.com/news/why-does-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa-lean).
Maybe it was hydraulic drilling gone bad? Nope. *Hydraulic drilling doesn't leave mud behind*;
besides, we see [plenty of it today](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-floods-spur-fracking-concerns/)
and no buried buildings. If the differences in old maps are
just [cartographic blunders](https://www.swanngalleries.com/news/maps-and-atlases/2015/05/a-famous-cartographic-blunder-the-island-of-california/)
why are the *errors* made in such detail, listing ports and islands, plotting rivers and mountains, and somehow failing
to spot massive structures like the Grand Canyon or Himalayan Mountains?

If we consider the possibility that all these events are linked, bigger questions emerge:
Where did this mud come from? Where did the energy to transport this mud come from? Was it
intentional? What would anyone stand to gain to cover this event up? What else was also covered-up, redacted, or erased
from history? To be convincing, the MFEE Hypothesis must reliably explain events of the past. Modern historians stick to
the *facts as written* and do not subscribe to theories of a world-wide MudFlood, a Great Reset, or any kind of
historical redaction. However, these theories cannot be ruled out either.

Researching any topic related to a Worldwide MudFlood Theory is difficult due to a lack of reliable research material.
Virtually all MudFlood
[books](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RV48YMN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1),
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dYfT2ccNNQ),
and [websites](https://stolenhistory.net/threads/mud-flood-dirt-rain-and-the-story-of-the-buried-buildings.25/)
are published by [Controlled Opposition Agents](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-controlled-opposition).
These medias typically feature [deep fake images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) of buildings that appear to be
*mudflooded*, yet show no underground buried architecture, and/or were not built prior to the 19th century.
These images are *designed to be easily debunked* and purposefully and
perpetually [net-boosted](https://www.meetcortex.com/blog/instagram-changes-algorithm-for-2018). The proliferation of
*"deep fake"* images is a [Revelation of the Method](https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/04/29/revelation-of-the-method/)
strategy that promotes discreditation of MudFlood Research.

## Updates to the MFEE Hypothesis

After a re-reading of Fomenko's New Chronology, I have started revising the MFEE Hypothesis with the following updates:

The MudFlood Energetic Event was triggered as a result of the need to defeat the
[Pugachev Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemelyan_Pugachev) in 1774 (and not Napoleon).
Therefore, the MudFlood event began in the 18th century, not the 19th. The primary trigger
for the Rebellion itself was the attempts by the Romanov-controlled state to disenfranchise Cossacks, serfs,
and tribal communities via heavy taxation, forced labor, and restrictions on their way of life.
In reality, this may have been the final war between the 'Royal' Christian giants who descended directly from Christ
and the smaller humans representing 'Apostolic' Christianity (ruled by the Romanov dynasty).

## Hypothesis

<PopImage {...require("./blood_rain2.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Bloodrain Paintings"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

The collection of memories known as the “MudFlood” may have come from a series of catastrophic events that occurred
after the Pugachev Rebellion of 1774 when strategic positions on the Earth were targeted by
large-scale [Directed Energy Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_weapon)
built by humans inhabiting the planet Mars. This assault
targeted [Pugachev's Army](https://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/files/2012/09/Pugachevs-Rebellion.pdf)
as well as remaining locations still loyal to the memory of the [Rus-Tartarian Empire](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html).
This attack resulted in a significant genocide of life on Earth
and allowed the humans on Mars to identify 'chosen people' who they would 'deliver' to various 'promised lands'
essentially repopulating Earth cities, redacting all Earth history, religion, science, and language, and impose a
system of control on the survivors that lasts to this day.

By discerning the complete scope of possibilities of a [redacted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis)
human historical record - by identifying biases inscribed by those who would benefit from bias, then a singular,
eclectic world history should emerge, *linking events by causality*, telling us where we all came from and how things
may have led up to the disturbing MudFlood Event.

<PopImage {...require("./mudflood_buried_buildings7.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Buried City Architecture"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

## Dependent Proofs & Concepts

A typical [Conspiracy Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory), *a.k.a. A Canceling Hypothesis*, will
posit the _lack_ of proof supporting a theory as a conspiracy in itself. The MudFlood Energetic Event Hypothesis is not
a Conspiracy Theory, as it relies on well known and verifiable proofs, even if such evidence is considered “debunked” by
the *popular* science establishment who remains unwilling or unable to investigate these topics deductively to this day.

We start off this investigation with a simple Question: Why would somebody purposefully redact history? The answer is:
**The ability to redact the past gives people in the present control of the future.** Those who deprive us of the
lessons of our past, can force us to repeat our mistakes - War, Famine, and Genocide - benefiting from a predictable
outcome that leaves them in charge when the dust settles.

Deductive logic demands the consideration of all possibilities, and _any_ phenomena may have multiple possible
explanations. For example, a dendritic path carved by water can appear identical to one cut instantly by electricity in
the lab. A petrification of a tree or animal that appears to have occurred over millions or billions of years can also
be [reproduced instantaneously in a lab](https://www.electricuniverse.info/electrical-scarring/) by a focused high
amplitude electric discharge. Citing
the [consensus explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus#Politicization_of_science) does not
“debunk” the alternate one.

Here are a list of **verifiable concepts** this hypothesis relies on:

### The Phantom Time Hypothesis

<PopImage {...require("./../chronology/fomenko_new_chronology.jpg?w=384")} alt="Phantom Time Hypothesis" width={450}
          height={300}
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

by Heribert Illig was published in 1991 and asserted that the Anno Domini dating system was fabricated by Jesuits
retroactively adding in a ‘phantom’ millennium of a thousand years to the timeline starting in the special year of
*AD1053*. Numerous authors such as Immanuel Velikovsky and [Anatoly Fomenko](https://chronologia.org/en) have
academically challenged the chronology of Scaligarian history. Both Catholics like St Jerome and Protestants like Joseph
Scaliger are accused of opportunistically reappropriating actual African, Asian, and American history into a false
European history sometime within the last 500 years.

[Read Fomenko's *New Chronology*](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/index.html)

The Rus-Horde Tartarian empire headquartered in the Kremlin, instead became the _Roman_ empire in Rome, Italy. The New
Testament was heavily redacted and translated from Cyrillic to Latin. In the 19th century, mass publication of holy
texts forced the Latin alphabet into indigenous languages worldwide. Eventually _Romance_ historians made the case that
Latin was the root of all language. The redaction of indigenous culture, science, history, medicine, and art into Latin
was remembered as The Renaissance. The memories world cataclysms became superstitious myths and religious prophecies.
The planet gods were forgotten, replaced by a new media-driven focus on Humanism, or as it’s known today, Communism.

But our shared human history is so spectacular that it’s not easy to invent a fake history to match. As the saying
goes _“You can’t make this stuff up”_. The 1995 movie The Usual Suspects demonstrates this concept - when covering up a
crime, the criminal will change the date of the events, the locations, even the names of the characters leaving the
causality of events intact. The worst crimes of history were pushed into deep antiquity or blamed on something else -
like a natural occurrence, or _terrorism_.

<PopImage {...require("./../cosmology/electric_universe/electric_universe.jpg?w=384")} alt="Electric Universe Theory"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

### The Electric Universe Theory

suggests that plasma physics played a central role in the creation of our solar system (and all solar systems!),
illustrated by primordial electric-scarring seen across the surface of our Moon and Mars. The same types of
negative [electric-scarring]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRV1e5_tB6Y) also appears in a few locations on Earth,
like the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and may have been rendered not so long ago - during the 19th century MudFlood Event.
The Electric Universe Theory also provides a scientific foundation for the Hollow Earth, the Young Earth, as well as the
Expanding Earth Models and effectively retires Meteor Impact/Crater Theories like the Alvarez hypothesis, Ancient
Dinosaur Fossils, and Uniformitarian Theory at large. Nevertheless, our children are still exposed to one-sided
scientific propaganda depicting a dead, chaotic, and meaningless universe - where virtually nothing is possible.

EU Theory is also the founding explanation for [Saturnian Cosmology](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html),
an alternative to those of Uniformitarian (NASA) and Creationist models of the Universe. In Saturnian Cosmology
the planets in our solar system were the Gods of old polytheistic religions. They loomed closely in the Earth’s sky,
clashed with each other, and wrought devastating cataclysms in primordial times resulting in the _encrypted_ mythical
narrative we know today.

### Human Activity on Mars

<PopImage {...require("./../mars/mars_life.jpg?w=384")} alt="Life on Mars"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

Martians have been described for centuries by religious authors such as Jesuit Athanasius Kircher who testified to
having visited each planet (even [inside the Sun!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RbXIMZmVv8)),
and [Creationist Emanuel Swedenborg](https://books.google.com/books?id=0wxOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)
inventor of [Uniformitarianism](https://www.britannica.com/science/uniformitarianism) (a century before
Hutton) and Nebular Accretion Theory in 1734 both still taught as fact in _secular_ schools today. The famous book
Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, categorized as fiction, described details of
the [Martian moons](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Swift.html) in 1727 a hundred
and fifty years before they were first discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877. Intelligent activity has been observed in
detail by early astronomers like Sir William Herschel who believed all our planets (including our Sun) were inhabited,
Giovanni Schiaparelli who saw man-made water channels on Mars, and of course Percival Lowell who in 1895 mapped out the
channels using a precision observatory he built in Flagstaff. At that same time, John Jacob Astor IV, 16 years before he
faked his own death on the Titanic, published testimony where he visited each planet, and yet again, traveled inside our
Sun.

<PopImage {...require("./../mars/mars_life2.jpg?w=384")} alt="Life on Mars"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

If these narratives are considered redacted from their original versions and posited as fiction, the possibility emerges
of planet Mars as home to a break-away human civilization which has influenced Earthly affairs during the entirety of
our shared history. Earth and Mars share thousands of years of recorded history, and during that time it is unlikely
that our inner-solar system affairs were exploited by any visiting lifeforms from other solar systems. The Saturnian
Golden Age was described as a time of high technology and advanced primordial life, so _any visiting aliens_ wouldn’t
have stood out back then.

Even today, Martians may look considerably different from you and me, - maybe cold-blooded, having green, scaly, or even
mutated skin - but they are still _humans_, our brothers and sisters. Their different appearances from us on Earth are a
result of having survived the colder, harsher conditions within Mars and on its surface throughout antiquity. An
overabundance of ores like iron, platinum, titanium, palladium, and chromium gave the Martians an early technological
start. However, their lack of agrarian and prolific resources drove them to seek subjugation of humans on Earth in order
to extract those resources. This subjugation was achieved through the suppression and controlled release of religion and
technology throughout history. Advanced communication, Free Energy, antigravity, and advanced weaponry were invented on
Mars centuries before they appeared on Earth.

### World Map Changes between 18th to 19th Centuries

The 1774 Tartarian Rebellion was cataclysmic and devastating (Fomenko uses the word 'wreckage') because Pugachev
could not be defeated without destroying all of remaining strongholds loyal to the memory of the Russian Horde as well.
All the Hordian cities of Siberia, Africa, Zealandia, the Middle East, and the Americas were targeted, melted down, and ultimately buried. To locate where these cities used to be, one needs only to pull up a map of 'Gold mines around the world'.

Before the rebellion, the Siberian Tartarian Kingdom still stood, along with now-mythical locations
(Israel, Mecca, Shangri-La, etc.).
During the rebellion, Siberia became the wasteland we know today, with all cities melted or buried, and only
the Romanov-controlled Moscow remained of the once great Empire.


<PopImage {...require("./map_california_island.jpg?w=384")}
          alt="MudFlood Evidence: California as an Island, and No Grand Canyon!"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

There are quite a few world maps dated before the 19th century which differ significantly from later maps.
For example, in North America the state of California appeared as an island larger than the United Kingdom.
There is no sign of the Grand Canyon, or the 1400-mile Colorado River. In old maps of Hindustan,
the tributaries of the Ganges are significantly different, and there is no sign of the
1500-mile Himalayan Mountain range. Russia released maps from their historical archives of a vast Tartarian empire
in Siberia in 2014, in response to a coup in Ukraine. In maps of Tartaria, again
there’s no Himalayan mountains, Tibetan Plateau, or Great Wall of China. The land was inhabited, decorated with a
majestic balance of water, trees, and natural boundaries - nothing like the uninhabitable wasteland we know today as
Siberia.

#### Holy-wood

If negative lightning scarring caused the creation of the Grand Canyon, it follows that the same negative energy would
behave differently around an island like California than it would in a plane like the mid-west. It is possible that the
during the MFEE the island of California became fused to the mainland of America. If this is what happened, then we
can also guess at the inspiration for the name 'Hollywood'. It might just be that the famous Red Wood forest was the
only forest of its kind (large trees) to survive the MFEE while all other forests were wiped out and in many cases
petrified. The island had redirected the secondary energy around it's bulk and back out into space, protecting the
'holy' forest.

### Giants Roamed the Earth

<PopImage {...require("./../genocide/giants_faeries/giants_news.jpg?w=384")} alt="Giants roamed the earth"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

In America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, the expurgation of our large-scale human brethren is today known as the
Smithsonian Cover Up. How did the Giants die? Why did the Giants die?
The [giant mounds](http://www.wisconsinmounds.com/DestroyedMounds.html) found all over America may not be
burial mounds as commonly thought, but instead may be the result of the MudFlood Energetic Event. During this event, the
Giants were wiped out by catastrophic electric discharges from the ground and atmosphere. The Giants were too large and
there was nowhere to hide. As they were struck down, their bones became instantaneously fossilized forming the burial
mounds. Petrification by electricity has been demonstrated in a laboratory by the Safire project. Dinosaur fossils
therefore may not be millions of years old, but misidentified Giant fossils created recently in the MudFlood Apocalypse.

<PopImage {...require("./../genocide/giants_faeries/genocide_giants9.jpg?w=384")} alt="Genocide of the Giants"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

To the Deep State, Giants of Earth represented one of the few remaining unconquered races, and an existential threat.
Therefore, the wiping out of the Giants was not an accident. The Smithsonian project began in 1846, systematically
destroying burial mounds across America, eliminating the evidence of the last civilization. What giant bones could not
be covered up were recategorized by the Natural History Museum as ancient *dinosaur* fossils. As a result of this cover
up, Historians have concluded that native Americans were of average human height and live in tents and caves on Stone
Age technology. They further insist that the many incredible Tartarian structures were built not by Americans but by
Europeans in the early 19th century, who then abruptly lost the technology to build these structures entirely. A more
convincing explanation is that picturesque Tartarian structures were all built by Giants. Why else would so many of them
have Giant entrance doors?

#### The 'Red-Skin' Native American Survivors of the MudFlood

The only direct survivors of the Mudflood that stuck around afterward were the 'Red-Skin' Native Americans.
These were the direct relatives of the Lamanites (human giants) who were killed in the MFEE. The heat of the event
turned their skin red. Shortly after, they were hunted to near extinction. Those who capitulated were relocated to asia
across the Bering Strait (Trail of tears). After the relocation, the Bering Strait was destroyed by the same
cannon(s) that destroyed Siberia and America.

### The Deep State

<PopImage {...require("./../chronology/redacted.jpg?w=384")} alt="History was Redacted"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

*Whom then are the beneficiaries of global conspiracy?*
Often in
a [controlled-opposition](https://markcrispinmiller.com/2020/12/what-is-controlled-opposition-read-this-then-look-around/)
environment, you'll find amateur conspiracy theorists railing against a particular race, religion, or creed.
You'll see conspirator accusations thrown at 'The British', 'The Jews', non-human ETs, dimensional demons, or even 'The
Devil' himself. It's important to understand the **Deep State** is loyal to no race, religion, or creed, but rather only
to their *family*.

<PopImage {...require("./../chronology/saturn/cosmic_mountain.jpg?w=384")} alt="Saturnian Cosmology: Cosmic Mountain"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

Atlantis represents the first human empire still remembered today. In Saturnian Cosmology, it was located on the highest
place in the collinear configuration where one could set foot - the North Pole of Planet Mars. Atlantis was the center
of all knowledge in its time. When the collinear configuration (also known as the Tower of Babel) came apart, the Golden
Age ended violently. A new dark age of cataclysm would begin lasting thousands of years. The Atlanteans took the fall
hard, and in their desperation to maintain their proto-empire they hid knowledge and technology from the species,
burying themselves into the highest levels of human bureaucracy, and establishing a totalitarian world order we today
call the Deep State.

In time, the Deep State re-established its empire on Earth by convincing the survivors of the Dark Age that the
[Saturnian](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html) creator of Earth was unhappy and was actively punishing its
creation. The priests ordered metal idols crafted of each of the Planet Gods. They had the idols placed inside pyramids
built across the equatorial regions of the globe, and using quantum telepathy, made these idols speak back to the
people. What the slaves didn't know was that the idols were not actually deities or planets speaking to them, but humans
inside other Pyramids on Earth and on Mars. Using this ploy, they indoctrinated more servants into Monotheism,
luring them with the promise of food, safety, and civilization.

#### The Pyramidal Empire

<PopImage {...require("./../chronology/pyramids/pyramids_around_the_world.jpg?w=640")} alt="Atlantis"

          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

This Pyramidal Empire was remembered as Ancient First Rome in the Nile Valley and in the Old Testament as the Egyptian,
Babylonian and Persian Empires. It existed for over a thousand years and eventually fell apart when a change in Earth’s
orbit shifted the equatorial climate of the region, creating the first deserts, eliminating the function of the Pyramids
and rendering them uninhabitable.

As a result, the upper class elite fled to central Europe, taking their slave religion with them, and established a
“Second Rome” in Istanbul, Turkey. Many black Egyptian slaves stayed behind to preserve the structures of the dissolved
Pyramidal Empire and maintain the Egyptian religion honoring the death of mythical creator god
Osiris.

#### Breakaway Civilization on Mars playing God on Earth

At the same time, humans who inhabit Mars became a break-away civilization, unable to travel to or communicate with the
Earth, and cut off from Earth resources. Becoming even more desperate, the Martians reinvented Atlantean technology to
survive and eventually drew plans to reestablish their empire on Earth. The invisible influence of the Deep State on
Mars and elsewhere would become mistaken as the will of a fictional invisible creator of the universe going by the name
Yahwey, ELOHIM “Creator, Mighty and Strong”, EL SHADDAI “God Almighty,”, ADONAI “My Lord”, or simply Ha-Shem (“The
Name”). This allowed the Deep State to communicate the will of God through cathedrals, telepaths, prophecy, visions, and
even special artifacts. Using its simulated God, the Deep State ordered humanity to commit endless religious warfare
against itself, dividing civilizations, and always benefiting from the conquest.

<PopImage {...require("./../conspiracy/vatican_suppressed_documents.jpg?w=384")} alt="Life on Mars"

According to Fomenko’s New Chronology, the starting date for modern civilization, Year Zero, was shifted forward in time
to the special year of 1053 AD by the Roman Catholic Church. Originally, Year Zero marked the end of Earth’s formation
events and the beginning of modern civilization, stable calendars, travel, and communication. Today, the same Catholic
Church hoards these ancient artifacts of our shared history in
a [53-mile tunnel](https://www.history.com/news/step-into-the-vaticans-secret-archives) underneath Vatican City. Many
ancient sites are still buried from the MudFlood. Only in the last 30 years have enough new artifacts been found and
made available to the public allowing us to complete the story that was hidden.

#### Canonization of the Holy Texts

With the final destruction of all the physical locations of existing world religions, each religion was 'canonized'
into the final form we know today. The latin word 'Canon' means both 'authority' and a large gun.
This likely means that the authority to canonize the books of the Bible was achieved by the firing of cannons in battle.

### No Supernatural Influence

We should only subscribe to scientific concepts that can be demonstrated *logically*, in a laboratory, or otherwise.
Real science is reproducible, reliable, and verifiable. For example, Saturnian Cosmology relies on the theoretical
foundation of the Electric Universe to correlate religious myths with interplanetary cataclysms seen in proximity
to the Earth by humanity. Mythical archetypes like the Thunderbolt of the Gods were then reproduced by the SAFIRE

The word **God** comes from the word *good*, and **Devil** comes from the word *evil* - defined as the opposite of
anything good. Both good and evil are observed in nature and need no further influence. This hypothesis proposes that
the invisible ‘supreme being’ known as God is actually a human construct invented by the Deep State in ancient times,
and it benefited that same Deep State to keep up the divine charade this whole time. We are ruling out the influence of
invisible Gods, devils, bug-like / or otherwise repulsive-looking aliens, a Galactic Federation, Simulation Theory,
5th Dimension, Mandela effect, magic, prophecy, and time-travel.

### Predictive Programming

          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The MFEE Hypothesis relies on the concept of *Predictive Programming* as a primer for navigating truth in the age of
disinformation. This theory (sometimes
called [Revelation of Method](https://exsplanet.blogspot.com/2009/12/revelation-of-method-predictive.html)) suggests
that Deep State agents deliberately leave hints of future events in popular fiction such as books, tv, movies, video
games, and news outlets. This is accomplished by the centralization of media, illustrated by Hollywood’s domination of
the world movie industry, and by categorizing something real as fiction, or something that isn’t real, as fact. The goal
of this method is to align public opinion with long term plans of the Deep State. Would-be dissenters of these plans
then tend to identify themselves early, allowing time for their opinions to be studied and an _official_
counter-narrative cultivated. This eventually leads to the public fighting each other and failing to find the real
culprit of their woes. [Michael A. Hoffman II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Hoffman_II) states:

> "The purpose behind the 'Revelation of the Method' is the implied consent of the populace. If no resistance is raised
> when they reveal the truth, the cryptocracy is free to continue to follow the satanic precept. 'DO WHAT THOU WILT IS
> THE WHOLE OF THE LAW.' In other words, when the cryptocracy reveals their evil manipulations and the MAJORITY of the
> people don't care, its checkmate."

### Causality

In journalism, students are taught to
answer [six key questions](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/the-journalistic-six)
to allow the reader to approach a topic from various angles. Who, What, Where, When, How, and Why. Instead of
systematically dismissing mountains of testimony from our ancestors, as historians tend to do, lets **consider it** and
allow the hi-story to tell itself. We owe it to our *ancestors and our descendents both* to find the answers to these
questions.

## What is the MFEE?

<PopImage {...require("./mudflood_buried_buildings.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Buried & Shifted Statues"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

The *MudFlood Energetic Event Hypothesis* proposes that the unexplained MudFlood memories collected from around the
world starting in the early 19th century were caused by a single energetic calamity. This planet-scale energy coursed
across
the Earth’s surface, tearing it up and tossing matter miles into the air resulting in the destruction and re-shaping of
land masses and the covering up of cities across the planet with mud. Entire mountain ranges were pulled out of the
ground in dendritic patterns by positive electric discharge while negative discharge tore canyons out of the earth -
identical to the lightning scarring seen across the surface of Mars.

<PopImage {...require("./mudflood_burried_statues.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Buried & Shifted Statues"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The emptied buildings of the “reset areas”, recently cleared of life, were then repopulated by orphan trains forming the
first cargo cults. Train tracks were promptly built across America, Europe, and Asia supplying humans and cargo.
Similarly, the first insane asylums were constructed across the world - everywhere the tracks led - with the purpose of
containing the memory of the Great Reset. Excavations of this buried world continued throughout the 19th and 20th
centuries, but instead of revealing the discoveries - they were surreptitiously kept secret, redacted, and even
out-right lied about. Of all the popular conspiracy theories that exist around the internet, the Mud Flood Energetic
Event stands out, opening eyes and blowing minds, and yet no hypothesis has been presented to explain _how_ it happened.

Deductively, such an event would have required a substantial release of energy to move trillions of tons of debris many
thousands of miles. We have to look for the source, because without the energy - there’s no MudFlood. For example, St.
Helens in 1980 erupted releasing 24 megatons of thermal energy resulting in 3 million cubic meters of volcanic mudflows
known as “lahars” being transported over 27 km. So,

## How did the MFEE Happen?

<PopImage {...require("./predictive_programming_simpsons_space_laser.jpg?w=384")}
          alt="Predictive Programming: Interplanetary Space Laser in The Simpsons"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The Mud Flood Energetic Event was caused by an interplanetary assault upon the Earth by humans who inhabit the planet
Mars. The method used to achieve this event was the construction of large-scale Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) on Mars
fired at Earth during opposition (a planetary alignment). These precision instruments of war devastating sovereign
kingdoms and airships, wiping out entire continents and islands. Locations that were not pre-selected for destruction
instead experienced heavy MudRains composed of the debris from the targeted regions.

As the DEWs heated the Earth’s surface, the energy built up within the Hollow Earth and eventually expelled back
through the surface as a *secondary* negative discharge. This second discharge flowed out of the earth at points of
the least resistance creating the volcanic regions known as the Ring of Fire,
arcing across America and Asia carving out canyons and melting rock.
This secondary discharge may have been unintentional as it added
a significant volume of material to the MudFlood Event that covered Eastern America and Western Europe.
It also left behind clues too big to be covered up.

### Trigger: Annihilation of the Giant Humans

The MudFlood Energetic Event was triggered as a result of the need to defeat the
[Pugachev Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemelyan_Pugachev) in 1774.
The cause for the Rebellion itself was the attempts by the Romanov-controlled state to
disenfranchise Cossacks, serfs,
and tribal communities.

Pugachev was a Giant human, as were much of his army.
He was also Peter the 3rd - Descendant of Christ and actual heir to the Russian throne.
He was not an imposter as the Romanov historians say.
For this reason, he was leading a rebellion of both Giants and smaller-sized humans
against the authority of the Romanovs who had seized control of the empire during the bloody Oprichnina.
He was, as the giants always were, the biggest threat to the Church and it's doctrine.
This was the 3rd major war between humans and Giants.
The first was the Crusade of the early 12th century (See [chronology](/chronology)).
The 2nd was the battle of Kulikovo where the Giants of the Horde succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology of the
smaller humans. In this battle, 'Royal' christianity was defeated by Apostolic Christianity that we know today
(Canonization). However, in Pugachev's time, Giants had their own cannons and were masters of 'guerrilla' warfare.
His rebellion was seen as a threat to all the military religious orders of the world, who were just as likely to
join Pugachev as to fight against him.

This rebellion forced the Deep State’s hand, requiring a correction of the most extreme nature -
a cataclysmic reset of life on Earth.
The Deep State chose not to reveal itself or its technology in this event, knowing the survivors would defer to
the church’s conclusion - that the defeat of Pugachev was a divine intervention by an angry creator god.
Giants were already hunted and eliminated throughout Europe by the Church, thus this one event
eliminated the *remaining* human giants of the world in a single blow.
If any survived, they got the message and left our plane permanently to reside in unknown regions (i.e. Hollow Earth).

<PopImage {...require("./../chronology/tartaria/tartarian_structures.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Tartaria"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

## Where was the MFEE?

The primary target for this event was the splintered Rus-Horde Empire which the West referred to as the
Great Tartary. The primary goal of this maximal damage campaign was to eliminate all temporal resistance to the Deep
State’s plans and prevent a human empire from ever reorganizing on Earth again. The secondary goal
of the Deep State was to preserve the churches and mosques of the Rus-Horde Empire,
stealing its history, redacting its indigenous Hoardian languages into
Latin Root, splintering its religious icons, and rebranding itself as the “Holy” Roman Empire.

<PopImage {...require("./secondary_negative_discharge.jpg?w=384")}
          alt="MudFlood Evidence: Secondary Negative Discharge"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The Rus-Horde Empire broke up in 1775 as a result of the defeat of Siberian war chief Pugachev by Russian General
Alexander Suvorov in the Cossack Rebellion. Up until that point, Tartarian vassal states spanned every continent. Now
these states would fall under the influence of the new Latin Empire. Those who resisted the church edict were eliminated
and their descendants enslaved. The mythical Kingdoms of the Pacific Islands were systematically annihilated -
electrically machined into lifeless atolls. Fortresses as far north as Scotland were annihilated leaving behind melted
ruins. The Giants of western America and eastern Eurasia were eradicated leaving behind hundreds of thousands of
[burial mounds](http://www.wisconsinmounds.com/DestroyedMounds.html). Land masses like Zelandia, Lemuria, and the Bering
Land Bridge were procedurally carved out using a negative
discharge leaving submerged continents. Mesas, never before seen on Earth, formed across Western America, North Africa,
and the Middle East. Mountains melted in Australia. Alchemic electrical scarring left painted rainbow canyons in China
and Tibet. Many Tartarian cathedrals like in St Petersburg and Salt Lake City harnessed the electric onslaught and
survived.

<PopImage {...require("./grand_canyon_criscross_lightning_scar.jpg?w=384")}
          alt="MudFlood Evidence: Grand Canyon CrisCross Scarring"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

The American west coasts were hit by an uncontrollable secondary negative electric discharge that arced across the
continent leaving behind a snaking electric scar over a thousand miles long - forming the Colorado River. In the dry
desert region the discharge became so large in amplitude that it tore into the Earth creating the Grand Canyon and the
Great Basin. Such dendritic scarring and incredible red rock formations like this are found nowhere else on Earth; yet
are seen across the surface of Mars - a planet which experienced intense negative electric discharge in the distant
past. Andrew Hall describes how electric discharges sculpted the american SouthWest:


> “... the land was zapped, carved and seared by electrical storms that could have happened last year, so fresh looked
> the marks of evidence.”_

</figure>

As the wreckage from these land masses filled the earth’s atmosphere and moved further away from the targeted zones,
this debris cooled and fell to Earth as “Mud”. Western Europe and Eastern America were hit by Mudfloods. Online today,
one can find many pictures of Tartarian buildings in America, Europe where the earth level has risen significantly above
the first floor with no explanation given. Also, one can find various paintings of an event where reddish mud known as
“BloodRain” fell from the sky.

#### The Secondary Discharge backfired on Mars

If we study the similarities between science fiction narratives, specifically related to interplanetary war
like Enders Game, Battlefield Earth, StarWars, Scientology, War of the Worlds etc.,
we might find a repeating story: a planet attacks another planet, but suffers a catastrophic *blow-back* as a
result.

It appears that whoever fired the DEWs at Earth either did not fully understand the risk, or did not care.
The direction of the energy through the body of the Earth would be ultimately determined by variations in
Earth Density.
Either way, in a desperate bid to defeat Pugachev, the cannons may have been fired **too rapidly** resulting in a
Secondary Discharge as the energy passed through the Earth at the target point, and exited the Earth from a secondary
point elsewhere. Mars was in opposition at the time, and thus the energy fired at the Earth would largely return to
Mars and cause further damage. Such an event is implied in the dialog of the Martian intro in the WotW PC game:

> [Elder 1]: The Age of disillusionment and decay is Over.
I have never before witnessed a mass telepathic execution, but today, the remnants of our society have
displayed their disheartenment and desperation.
They have judged the senior elder to be ineffectual and have terminated his appointment in the harshest manner;
The Gravity of our situation is Extreme.
> [Elder 2]: Mars is incapable of sustaining life, our efforts to maintain the biosphere are exhausted.
The water tables and temperature decrease annually, As does our population.
> [Elder 3]: The only consequential course of action is the conquest and occupation of Earth - our young sunward neighbor.

This predictive programming suggests that life on Mars has not reached exhaustion due to being *very ancient*, but
rather as a result of their planetary ecosystem taking a massive hit during the MFEE. Clearly the majority of
Martians did not agree with nor benefit from this attack on Earth, and in every version of the story the instigator
of the war (Senior Elder/Xenu/Terl/Ender etc.) was deposed exiled and/or executed.

## When was the MFEE?

Most MudFlood researchers will place the event between the late 18th and early 19th century when we find an abundance
of photos of “reset cities” cleared of life, and Tartarian buildings and other monuments buried stories into the ground.

In the 16th-17th century, the rebellious Reformation of Western Europe began to detach itself
(and it's military religious orders)
from the Tartarian Empire. Spain issued the [*Requerimiento of 1513*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Requirement_of_1513)
(most likely this date was pushed back around 150 years) outlining another plan for world domination
(see [Rex Bellator 1291](https://es-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Rex_Bellator?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US))
and offering the indigenous people of former Tartarian lands a choice -
slavery and annihilation - threatening their families with subjection to the “yoke and obedience of the Church and of
their Highness's”. The natives were not threatened by this yet, and tolerated the emergence of Catholics and Protestant
colonists on their land up until the middle of the 18th century, when they finally put up a massive rebellion
led by Pugachev.

The trigger for the rebellion was efforts by the Reformist (Catholic/Protestant) Church to impose taxation and usury
upon American lands leading up to the Townshend Acts of 1767 and the Boston Tea Party of 1773 when Mohawk (Giants)
tossed 342 chests of tea into the harbor in protest. The Reformation Historians then redacted the memory of the
Tea Party eliminating the influence of natives by claiming that instead
'colonists disguised themselves as Native Americans'.

## Why did the MFEE happen?

In 1774, Pugachev's rebellion reached a peak, and claiming to be Peter III and a direct descendant of Christ,
Pugachev was in a position to claim rulership of the *entire Tartarian Empire* and overthrow the foreign House of
Romanov that had ruled the empire since the Oprichnina. Had this happened, Pugachev would have been in a position to
smash the Western European Reformation/Renaissance that threatened the Tartarian empire for so long.
Had he accomplished that, the Russian Tartarian Empire could have returned to its former glory with a vengeance
re-conquering the entire world, and imposing upon it a Second Inquisition that would have erased the
Reformation/Renaissance and Monotheism, and along with them, slavery, usury, and everything else in Pandora's Box.

The Protestant Reformation that was planning to erase the Russian empire was sponsored largely by Humans on Mars over
the course of human history - with Martian agents appearing as angels in cathodic telepathic visions.
These same influences on Mars would not suffer seeing all their plans and efforts over hundreds of years destroyed
as a result of the Rebellion and took a desperate measures to reverse Pugachev's accomplishments
and preserve the Renaissance - they built and fired one or more massive DEW cannons built on Mars targeting each city
liberated by Pugachev. By the end of the war in 1775, all of Siberia, the once great Tartarian Kingdom, remained a
wasteland, with all of it's mythical locations melted and/or buried.


## Who caused the MFEE?

<PopImage {...require("./1557_lycosthenes_rain_of_stones_meteorite.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: A deadly rain of stones. Woodcut with
early handcolouring from Conrad Lycosthenes' (Chronicle of Prodigies and Omens) - 'Prodigiorum ac Ostentorum Chronicon'
Published Hendricus Petri, Basel, allegedly 1557. This image appears to show a shower of meteorites - Lycosthenes notes
they are **stones** and not hail."
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The only entity capable of causing such destruction was the advanced human civilization living on Mars
which had broken away after the Golden Age. Until the war of 1773, Human Martians had used cathodal
churches and telepathy to play God on Earth, perform espionage, and speak to religious leaders through
'visions of angels'. Through simple tricks,
they managed to consolidate nearly all religious military orders of the Earth via treaties like Rex Bellator.
The only demographic they could not consolidate were the human giants, partially because they were difficult
to defeat in battle, and partially because they historically rejected Monotheism.

The entity known as the Deep State is as old as humanity itself and is located in all the secret places of the Earth, as
well as places we were told Humans cannot live, like on planet Mars. In their desperation to stop Pugachev, they
employed use of large-scale DEWs on Mars that would become the instrument that reversed the victories of the rebellion,
annihilating his army along with the infrastructure of the Russian Hordian Empire and its allies. Starting in 1774,
the Mars DEWs eliminated all threats to the Deep State on Earth and set the stage for a reset of history. By doing it
this way, the Deep State covered up its own involvement while striking the fear of God into the survivors who had
little choice but to accept the Church’s conclusion -
that Pugachev’s defeat was Divine Retribution by God for insubordination.

<PopImage {...require("./1844_blood_rain.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Buried Cities"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

During the 40+ years of the MudFlood Event, much of the Earth became an unlivable desert. Many ecosystems in
places like the Middle East, North Africa, Australia etc. never recovered and remain deserts. If the Deep State was the
cause of the MudFlood, then they were in a unique position to become the saviors of humanity as life on earth began
to die at increasing rates. Playing God, the Deep State chose a new set of Israelites to survive the apocalypse.
These “chosen” humans were kept alive via cargo (or “mana”) from a mysterious supplier that
posed itself as the Creator God of the Universe. Eventually, this same God offers the Israelites a slave contract known
as *The Mosaic Covenant* or *“10 Commandments”* and promises if they live by the contract, that they will be delivered
to a 'promised' land. So, after surviving the **40+ years wandering the MudFlooded Earth desert**, agents of the
Deep State deliver each Israelite group to the relative ‘Promised Land’, as promised!
Those Israelites who disobeyed God’s command quickly perished, either denied cargo and starved,
or were slaughtered by their peers in an attempt to appease *God’s wrath*.
Events of the Mudflood were then further redacted into the ‘Old Testament’, merged with ancient stories, and mass
printed in the 19th century.

### 1776: The Greatest Reset

With the defeat of Pugachev came another **Great Reset** and a return of Monotheistic Deep
State ruler-ship enshrined in the [Declaration of Independence 1776](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript).

> ...the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,
> is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions

By painting the native Americas as enemies of the state, the founders of the United States of America would unleash
upon the 'new world' everything the natives fought and died to prevent -
Slavery and debt prisons,
Usury and taxes,
Secret Societies,
Bloodline Aristocracies,
Forced mass worship and labor.
[Pledges of Allegiance](https://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm),
[False Flag Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror),
Endless Wars,
Genocide & Population control,
Planned obsolescence, famine, & scarcity.

This document never mentioned the Tartarian Empire, much of which had already been physically destroyed.
All ties to the old empire were inherited and redacted by agents of the western European Reformation (i.e. Renaissance).
The memory of the once great world empire that stood for stability, peace, and abundance for centuries
was erased. All subjects of this former empire became 'savage indians' targeted for elimination by European colonists.
A new form of slavery involving chains and whips, rarely seen before on Earth,
became [prevalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation#United_States).
Pandora's Box was opened once again.

<PopImage {...require("./YorkRetreat.jpg?w=384")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: *The York Retreat* Insane Asylum"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

The Deep State knew that if they exposed their technology to reverse the achievements of the Pugachev Rebellion,
it would be only a matter of time until their clandestine ruler-ship would be exposed and then lost completely.
To reassert control of the religions of Earth, while continuing to hide their existence, they needed everyone to be
convinced that Pugachev and his allies were 'wicked' and eventually defeated by God.

The Deep State would continue covering up its tracks by re-classifying all threatening literature as
*“Fantasy” or “Science Fiction”*. All references to advanced technology or life on Mars would become suppressed - unless
it was categorized as fiction. Those who resisted the Reset disappeared into new or converted insane asylums across the
planet. In North America, former libraries and churches were refashioned into large-scale asylums were
abd maintained in Baltimore, New Orleans, Madison N.J.,
and New York - and run by the government with a heavy church involvement. Sometimes the asylums were built and maintained
directly by the regional church, like the York Retreat run by Quakers. Under the guise of mental health, patients who
remembered the pre-MudFlood world were sequestered, tortured, left to rot to death in small cells. Patients were
referred to as [*lunatics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunatic).

## Return of Slavery

1. [The MAAFA](http://nationaljuneteenth.com/Maafa.html) is a Kiswahili term for "terrible occurrence" or "great
disaster". It refers to the Black Holocaust when millions of Africans died allegedly during the journey of captivity
from the west coast of Africa to the shores of America. This memory may instead be the world war of 1812 and the
subsequent return of slavery afterward. French Race Census became illegal starting FR of 1789. Revolution concepts
like universal suffrage, abolition of slavery, and citizenship promoted Afro-French immigration. Thomas-Alexandre
Dumas became France’s first black general in 1793.  \
Between 1807 and 1860, the Royal Navy's ‘suppression’ Squadron seized thousands of free ships of the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans and sold them (slavery was banned) to the Portuguese-run TransAtlantic Slave Trade. During this time,
the British navy relocated 150,000 Africans from the French empire to the British colony of Sierra Leone to work in
Sugar Plantations.
2. Michael Mann, basing his figures on those provided by Justin McCarthy, states that between 1821 and 1922, a large
number of Muslims were expelled from Southeast Europe as Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia declared independence. Mann
describes these events as "murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe".

8. Not appearing on old maps i.e. 1688
9. Rio Grande dried up 1890
10. Water was redirected west through Grand Junction creating the ‘Colorado River’
11. Local population redacted into ‘Sinagua’ (without water) and ‘Hopi’ (obedient). Montezuma’s Castle may be fake, (
which is harder to prove)

20. Rain covers up old scars. Desert preservesPositive Lightning Scars
21. Sand Deserts and Dunes result of negative scarring
22. from the MudFlood?
23. Found on Mars
24. The majority of the sandy shorelines in marine protected areas are eroding, raising cause for serious concern
25. Waikiki has seen so much erosion that over the past century they have had to import sand. taking sand from the
beach is now illegal in Hawaii
26. Alternate Theories
27. Old Seabed
28. weathering bedrock
29. River rocks
30. Mesas and Melted Mountains
31. Yet Shiprock itself, and a number of similar formations are well removed from those volcanic fields, standing
alone on the high desert plains. They are attributed to an ancient volcanic complex called the Navajo Volcanic
Field but are not surrounded by lava flows, ash deposits, or any other features provably volcanic in origin
32. Mars mesa and knobs are separated by flat lying lowlands. They are thought to form from ice-facilitated mass
wasting processes from ground or atmospheric sources
33. [India Map](https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/62761/asiae-novissima-tabula-de-jode) Changed
34. River changed direction
35. No Himilayan Mountains
36. No Ganges River (3rd largest river on Earth)
37. [Another Map](https://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/65841/asia-partium-orbis-maxima-de-jode) with no Ganges
river or Himilayans
38. Largest rivers no longer end at Gulf of Kutch

39. Grand canyon's Appalachian Sand mystery.
it is a well-established fact that significant portions of the sand
that makes up the Grand Canyon originated in the Appalachian Mountains.
Specifically, Navajo Sandstone, a prominent rock formation within the canyon,
has been linked to the ancient Appalachian Mountains as its source.
https://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/nature/sand-source.htm#:~:text=These%20tiny%2C%20rare%20grains%20of%20zircon%20have,desert%20winds%20to%20the%20Colorado%20Plateau%20region.&text=Sediment%20eroded%20from%20these%20mountains%20was%20transported%20by%20ancient%20rivers%20toward%20the%20western%20coastline.

However, the idea of sand moving that far and ending up in the GC is ludicrous.
Instead, we should consider that the sand making up the Appalachian Mountains
**is in fact the same sand removed from the Grand Canyon** in the
MudFlood Energetic Event.

Built by machine, Suez flooded the Nile starting 1869
until [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile). \
Nile is only river flowing north in the world, but it also flows south in Sudan for 200 miles.
13. Masada - mesa

15. Jerusalem Mudflood - In recent months remains of an impressive building from the Hasmonean period (second
century BCE) are being unearthed in excavations the Israel Antiquities Authority is directing in the Givati
parking lot, located in the City of David in the Walls Around Jerusalem National
Park. [https://www.biblewalks.com/Givati](https://www.biblewalks.com/Givati)
16. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of
the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of
a "step-over" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent
subsidence.

del Carpine, William of Rubruck, Marco Polo, Odoric of Pordenone and Giovanni de' Marignolli, mentioned the
Great Wall.
28. While portions north of Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated,
in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build
houses and roads

1. Island of California?
2. North region incognita (Spanish for ‘unknown’)
3. Break up of Mu

## Orphan Trains

1. [https://youtu.be/DP0qV2DN3mo?t=378](https://youtu.be/DP0qV2DN3mo?t=378)
2. According to the museum’s website, the Orphan Train Movement transported around 250,000 needy, neglected, and
orphaned children from New York to other regions of the United States and Canada
from [1854 to 1929](https://vitabrevis.americanancestors.org/2015/10/orphan-trains/).
3. In 1850 the U.S. population was twenty-three million. By 1880 it had more
than [doubled](https://hometownbyhandlebar.com/?p=32125).
4. The mid-1800s wasn’t a good time to be a kid in New York City. Mud and excrement puddled in the streets. Children and
adults slept in sagging, damp shacks. Dirty homes, dirty roads, dirty clothes, and modern sanitation waited decades
away. Only the luckiest of these immigrants escaped, since few businesses paid this first wave of American
immigrants—mostly Irish, British, and German—a living wage. From 1854 to 1929, these trains, sponsored either by
government funding or sponsorship by wealthy philanthropists, sent roughly 200,000 children to the Midwest (with most
to Indiana in the first decade). Applications were accepted from virtually any area except those in slave-owning
southern states to preserve the race-based plantation system 30 degrees to the equator. \
One veteran of the orphan train, a Missouri Orphan Train veteran described her foster parents in clear terms: “They
weren't meant, they were cold, and they showed no feeling toward me. When I was 15 or 16 I decided I’d live in a
garbage can before I’d stay there any longer.” \

## Resettable cities across the planet today

1. [Victorian-style Architecture](https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/victorian-architecture) may be

8. Nuclear war
9. Buildings damaged to make new buildings

11. Colosseum of Rome,Italy

## Hypothesis Checklist

1. Falsifiability - Hypothesis is wrong if
2. Another energy source to explain the movement of mud
3. Another explanation for MudFlood buildings
4. A collection of unrelated disasters can explain the MudFlood
5. Another explanation for Melted Buildings and fortresses found world-wide
6. Napoleon legitimately failed to invade Moscow in 1812
7. Life on Mars can be disproven
8. If recently created locations like Australia, Israel, China, India, or the Grand Canyon have a history before
1776/1812
9. Parsimony “Occam’s Razor” - Hypothesis excessive if
10. A simpler explanation for - MudFlood / melted buildings, the added Grand canyon or break up of Mu continent, and
the reset of civilization - than a space laser on Mars targeting geopolitical enemies on Earth.
11. Scope & Fruitfulness
12. By limiting the scope of this event to our solar system affairs, we can predict that this event is not repeatable
and will never happen again
13. Conservatism
14. The conclusion of this hypothesis does not “fit” with any modern knowledge-systems, and instead suggests that
academia as we know it is little more than an elaborate system of control meant to obfuscate any and all truth.

## Misc:

Predictive Programming in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.
Hayao Miyazaki's #1 best anime features a post-mudflood apocalyptic world, poisoned topsoil world-wide, a prophecy  of a saviour and "promised" land after wandering in the desert, and Earth destroyed by human made weapon. This is yet another example of Revelation-Of-The-Method predictive programming driven by a MudFlood narrative and thus providing many clues as to the unredacted true story behind it.

          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

For years now, the MudFlood topic has been dominated by controlled opposition agents like the admins at
stolenhistory.org or Flat-Earthers like Philipp Druzhinin. You’ll find that when approaching the actual truth of any
conspiracy theory, you **will** encounter a series of corporate-funded gate-keepers attempting to lure you off the path
of your investigation - and into controlled opposition conclusions; New Age movements like 5D, Flat Earth, Fetus-looking
Ancient Aliens, or invisible Gods. Keep an open mind, Inspector - and happy investigating!
