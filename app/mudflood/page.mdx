The MudFlood Energetic Event Hypothesis proposes a solution to the mystery of the world-wide ‘Mud Flood’ event and its
alleged cover-up while attempting to answer
the [Journalistic Six](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/the-journalistic-six):
**Who** it happened to, **What** happened, **When, Where, Why, **and** How** did it happen?

## What is the MudFlood Theory?

Proponents of the *MudFlood Theory* compare photographs, maps, and testimonies which suggest that in the early 19th
century an unexplained world-wide *mud-rain* event abruptly and permanently raised the ground level around existing
cathedrals, pyramids, and other monuments - burying entire civilizations across the earth. Additionally, during this
time [maps of America](https://www.amazon.com/Issues-Maps-18th-century-History/dp/1549802968)
and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartary) changed significantly. During
many [world-wide excavations](https://www.sciencefocus.com/planet-earth/why-do-we-have-to-dig-so-deep-to-uncover-ancient-ruins/)
of buried cities, no satisfying explanation is ever given as to **how** they got buried in the first place.
Did foundations sink into the ground as a result of [liquefaction](https://www.scienceworld.ca/resource/liquefaction/)?
If
so, why aren't the buildings tilted, like the
[Tower of Pisa](https://www.history.com/news/why-does-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa-lean).
Maybe it was hydraulic drilling gone bad? Nope. *Hydraulic drilling doesn't leave mud behind*; we
see [plenty of it today](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colorado-floods-spur-fracking-concerns/)
and no buried buildings. If the differences in old maps are
just [cartographic blunders](https://www.swanngalleries.com/news/maps-and-atlases/2015/05/a-famous-cartographic-blunder-the-island-of-california/)
why are the *errors* made in such detail, listing ports and islands, plotting rivers and mountains, and somehow failing
to spot massive structures like the Grand Canyon or Himalayan Mountains?

If we consider the possibility that all these events are linked, bigger questions emerge:
Where did this mud come from? Where did the energy to transport this mud come from? Was it
intentional? What would anyone stand to gain to cover this event up? What else was also covered-up, redacted, or erased
from history? To be convincing, the MFEE Hypothesis must reliably explain events of the past. Modern historians stick to
the *facts as written* and do not subscribe to theories of a world-wide MudFlood, a Great Reset, or any kind of
historical redaction. However, these theories cannot be ruled out either.

Researching any topic related to a Worldwide MudFlood Theory is difficult due to a lack of reliable research material.
Virtually all MudFlood
[books](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RV48YMN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1),
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dYfT2ccNNQ),
and [websites](https://stolenhistory.net/threads/mud-flood-dirt-rain-and-the-story-of-the-buried-buildings.25/)
are published by [Controlled Opposition Agents](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-controlled-opposition).
These medias typically feature [deep fake images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) of buildings that appear to be
*mudflooded*, yet show no underground buried architecture, and/or were not built prior to the 20th century.
These images are *designed to be easily debunked* and purposefully and
perpetually [net-boosted](https://www.meetcortex.com/blog/instagram-changes-algorithm-for-2018). The proliferation of
*"deep fake"* images is a [Revelation of the Method](https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/04/29/revelation-of-the-method/)
strategy that promotes discreditation of MudFlood Research.

# Hypothesis

<PopImage src={require("./blood_rain2.jpg")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Bloodrain Paintings"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

The collection of memories known as the “MudFlood” may have come from a series of catastrophic events that occurred
after the World War of 1812 when strategic positions on the Earth were targeted by
large-scale [Directed Energy Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_weapon)
built by humans inhabiting the planet Mars. This assault
targeted [Napoleon’s Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia#Losses)
as well as all French Colonies and Allies of
the [Jesuit Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus#Expansion). Also targeted was the Empire’s
old enemy - the recently fallen [Rus-Tartarian Empire](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/08.html). This
attack resulted in
a [genocide of 75% of all life on Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Heaven-Bearers-Great-Reset-Flood/dp/B089M41X8R)
and allowed the humans on Mars to repopulate Earth cities, redact history, religion, science, and language, and impose a
system of control on the survivors that lasts to this day.

By discerning the complete scope of possibilities of a [redacted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis)
human historical record - by identifying biases inscribed by those who would benefit from bias, then a singular,
eclectic world history should emerge, *linking events by causality*, telling us where we all came from and how things
may have led up to the disturbing MudFlood Event.

# Dependent Proofs & Concepts

A typical [Conspiracy Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory), *a.k.a. A Canceling Hypothesis*, will
posit the _lack_ of proof supporting a theory as a conspiracy in itself. The MudFlood Energetic Event Hypothesis is not
a Conspiracy Theory, as it relies on well known and verifiable proofs, even if such evidence is considered “debunked” by
the *popular* science establishment who remains unwilling or unable to investigate these topics deductively to this day.

We start off this investigation with a simple Question: Why would somebody purposefully redact history? The answer is:
**The ability to redact the past gives people in the present control of the future.** Those who deprive us of the
lessons of our past, can force us to repeat our mistakes - War, Famine, and Genocide - benefiting from a predictable
outcome that leaves them in charge when the dust settles.

Deductive logic demands the consideration of all possibilities, and _any_ phenomena may have multiple possible
explanations. For example, a dendritic path carved by water can appear identical to one cut instantly by electricity in
the lab. A petrification of a tree or animal that appears to have occurred over millions or billions of years can also
be [reproduced instantaneously in a lab](https://www.electricuniverse.info/electrical-scarring/) by a focused high
amplitude electric discharge. Citing
the [consensus explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus#Politicization_of_science) does not
“debunk” the alternate one.

Here are a list of **verifiable concepts** this hypothesis relies on:

## The Phantom Time Hypothesis

<PopImage src={require("./../chronology/fomenko_new_chronology.jpg")} alt="Phantom Time Hypothesis" width={450}
          height={300}
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

by Heribert Illig was published in 1991 and asserted that the Anno Domini dating system was fabricated by Jesuits
retroactively adding in a ‘phantom’ millennium of a thousand years to the timeline starting in the special year of
*AD1053*. Numerous authors such as Immanuel Velikovsky and [Anatoly Fomenko](https://chronologia.org/en) have
academically challenged the chronology of Scaligarian history. Both Catholics like St Jerome and Protestants like Joseph
Scaliger are accused of opportunistically reappropriating actual African, Asian, and American history into a false
European history sometime within the last 500 years.

[Read Fomenko's *New Chronology*](https://chronologia.org/en/how_it_was/index.html)

The Rus-Horde Tartarian empire headquartered in the Kremlin, instead became the _Roman_ empire in Rome, Italy. The New
Testament was heavily redacted and translated from Cyrillic to Latin. In the 19th century, mass publication of holy
texts forced the Latin alphabet into indigenous languages worldwide. Eventually _Romance_ historians made the case that
Latin was the root of all language. The redaction of indigenous culture, science, history, medicine, and art into Latin
was remembered as The Renaissance. The memories world cataclysms became superstitious myths and religious prophecies.
The planet gods were forgotten, replaced by a new media-driven focus on Humanism, or as it’s known today, Communism.

But our shared human history is so spectacular that it’s not easy to invent a fake history to match. As the saying
goes _“You can’t make this stuff up”_. The 1995 movie The Usual Suspects demonstrates this concept - when covering up a
crime, the criminal will change the date of the events, the locations, even the names of the characters leaving the
causality of events intact. The worst crimes of history were pushed into deep antiquity or blamed on something else -
like a natural occurrence, or _terrorism_.

<PopImage src={require("./../cosmology/electric_universe/electric_universe.jpg")} alt="Electric Universe Theory"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

## The Electric Universe Theory

suggests that plasma physics played a central role in the creation of our solar system (and all solar systems!),
illustrated by primordial electric-scaring seen across the surface of our Moon and Mars. The same types of
negative [electric-scarring]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRV1e5_tB6Y) also appears in a few locations on Earth,
like the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and may have been rendered not so long ago - during the 19th century MudFlood Event.
The Electric Universe Theory also provides a scientific foundation for the Hollow Earth, the Young Earth, as well as the
Expanding Earth Models and effectively retires Meteor Impact/Crater Theories like the Alvarez hypothesis, Ancient
Dinosaur Fossils, and Uniformitarian Theory at large. Nevertheless, our children are still exposed to one-sided
scientific propaganda depicting a dead, chaotic, and meaningless universe - where virtually nothing is possible.

EU Theory is also the founding explanation for Saturnian Cosmology, an alternative to those of Uniformitarian (NASA) and
Creationist models of the Universe. In Saturnian Cosmology the planets in our solar system were the Gods of old
polytheistic religions. They loomed closely in the Earth’s sky, clashed with each other, and raught devastating
cataclysms in primordial times resulting in the _encrypted_ mythical narrative we know
today.

## Human Activity on Mars

<PopImage src={require("./../mars/mars_life.jpg")} alt="Life on Mars"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

Martians have been described for centuries by religious authors such as Jesuit Athanasius Kircher who testified to
having visited each planet (even [inside the Sun!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RbXIMZmVv8)),
and [Creationist Emanuel Swedenborg](https://books.google.com/books?id=0wxOAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false)
inventor of [Uniformitarianism](https://www.britannica.com/science/uniformitarianism) (a century before
Hutton) and Nebular Accretion Theory in 1734 both still taught as fact in _secular_ schools today. The famous book
Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, categorized as fiction, described details of
the [Martian moons](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Swift.html) in 1727 a hundred
and fifty years before they were first discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877. Intelligent activity has been observed in
detail by early astronomers like Sir William Herschel who believed all our planets (including our Sun) were inhabited,
Giovanni Schiaparelli who saw man-made water channels on Mars, and of course Percival Lowell who in 1895 mapped out the
channels using a precision observatory he built in Flagstaff. At that same time, John Jacob Astor IV, 16 years before he
faked his own death on the Titanic, published testimony where he visited each planet, and yet again, traveled inside our
Sun.

<PopImage src={require("./../mars/mars_life2.jpg")} alt="Life on Mars"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

If these narratives are considered redacted from their original versions and posited as fiction, the possibility emerges
of planet Mars as home to a break-away human civilization which has influenced Earthly affairs during the entirety of
our shared history. Earth and Mars share roughly 6000 years of recorded history, and during that time it is unlikely
that our inner-solar system affairs were exploited by any visiting lifeforms from other solar systems. The Saturnian
Golden Age was described as a time of high technology and advanced primordial life, so _any visiting aliens_ wouldn’t
have stood out back then.

Even today, Martians may look considerably different from you and me, - maybe cold-blooded, having green, scaly, or even
mutated skin - but they are still _humans_, our brothers and sisters. Their different appearances from us on Earth are a
result of having survived the colder, harsher conditions within Mars and on its surface throughout antiquity. An
overabundance of ores like iron, platinum, titanium, palladium, and chromium gave the Martians an early technological
start. However, their lack of agrarian and prolific resources drove them to seek subjugation of humans on Earth in order
to extract those resources. This subjugation was achieved through the suppression and controlled release of religion and
technology throughout history. Advanced communication, Free Energy, anti-gravity, and advanced weaponry were invented on
Mars centuries before they appeared on Earth.

## Giants Roamed the Earth

<PopImage src={require("./../genocide/giants_faeries/giants_news.jpg")} alt="Giants roamed the earth"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

In America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, the expurgation of our large-scale human brethren is today known as the
Smithsonian Cover Up. How did the Giants die? Why did the Giants die?
The [giant mounds](http://www.wisconsinmounds.com/DestroyedMounds.html) found all over America may not be
burial mounds as commonly thought, but instead may be the result of the MudFlood Energetic Event. During this event, the
Giants were wiped out by catastrophic electric discharges from the ground and atmosphere. The Giants were too large and
there was nowhere to hide. As they were struck down, their bones became instantaneously fossilized forming the burial
mounds. Petrification by electricity has been demonstrated in a laboratory by the Safire project. Dinosaur fossils
therefore may not be millions of years old, but misidentified Giant fossils created recently in the MudFlood Apocalypse.

<PopImage src={require("./../genocide/giants_faeries/genocide_giants9.jpg")} alt="Genocide of the Giants"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

To the Deep State, Giants of Earth represented one of the few remaining unconquered races, and an existential threat.
Therefore, the wiping out of the Giants was not an accident. The Smithsonian project began in 1846, systematically
destroying burial mounds across America, eliminating the evidence of the last civilization. What giant bones could not
be covered up were recategorized by the Natural History Museum as ancient dinosaur fossils. As a result of this cover
up, Historians have concluded that native Americans were of average human height and live in tents and caves on Stone
Age technology. They further insist that the many incredible Tartarian structures were built not by Americans but by
Europeans in the 18th century, who then abruptly lost the technology to build these structures entirely. A more
convincing explanation is that picturesque Tartarian structures were all built by Giants. Why else would so many of them
have Giant entrance doors?

## The Deep State

<PopImage src={require("./../chronology/redacted.jpg")} alt="History was Redacted"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

*Whom then are the beneficiaries of global conspiracy?*
Often in
a [controlled-opposition](https://markcrispinmiller.com/2020/12/what-is-controlled-opposition-read-this-then-look-around/)
environment, you'll find amateur conspiracy theorists railing against a particular race, religion, or creed.
You'll see conspirator accusations thrown at 'The British', 'The Jews', non-human ETs, dimensional demons, or even 'The
Devil' himself. It's important to understand the **Deep State** is loyal to no race, religion, or creed, but rather only
to their *family*.

<PopImage src={require("./../chronology/saturn/cosmic_mountain.jpg")} alt="Saturnian Cosmology: Cosmic Mountain"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

Atlantis represents the first human empire still remembered today. In Saturnian Cosmology, it was located on the highest
place in the collinear configuration where one could set foot - the north pole of Planet Mars. Atlantis was the center
of all knowledge in its time. When the collinear configuration (also known as the Tower of Babel) came apart, the Golden
Age ended violently. A new dark age of cataclysm would begin lasting thousands of years. The Atlanteans took the fall
hard, and in their desperation to maintain their proto-empire they hid knowledge and technology from the species,
burying themselves into the highest levels of human bureaucracy, and establishing a totalitarian world order we today
call the Deep State.

In time, the Deep State re-established its empire on Earth by convincing the survivors of the Dark Age that the
Saturnian creator of Earth was unhappy and was actively punishing its creation. The priests ordered metal idols crafted
of each of the Planet Gods. They had the idols placed inside pyramids built across the equatorial regions of the globe,
and using quantum telepathy, made these idols speak back to the people. What the slaves didn’t know was that the idols
were not actually deities or planets speaking to them, but humans inside of other Pyramids on Earth and on Mars. Using
this ploy, they indoctrinated more servants into Monotheism, luring them with the promise of food, safety, and
civilization.

### The Pyramidal Empire

<PopImage src={require("./../chronology/pyramids/pyramids_around_the_world.jpg")} alt="Atlantis"

<PopImage src={require("./../chronology/saturn/cathoderal.jpg")} alt="Saturnian Cosmology: Cathoderal"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

This Pyramidal Empire was remembered as Ancient First Rome in the Nile Valley and in the Old Testament as the Egyptian,
Babylonian and Persian Empires. It existed for over a thousand years and eventually fell apart when a change in Earth’s
orbit shifted the equatorial climate of the region, creating the first deserts, eliminating the function of the Pyramids
and rendering them uninhabitable.

As a result, the upper class elite fled to central Europe, taking their slave religion with them, and established a
“Second Rome” in Istanbul, Turkey. Many black Egyptian slaves stayed behind to preserve the structures of the dissolved
Pyramidal Empire and maintain the Egyptian religion honoring the death of mythical creator god
Osiris.

### Breakaway Civilization on Mars playing God on Earth

At the same time, humans who inhabit Mars became a break-away civilization, unable to travel to or communicate with the
Earth, and cut off from Earth resources. Becoming even more desperate, the Martians reinvented Atlantean technology to
survive and eventually drew plans to reestablish their empire on Earth. The invisible influence of the Deep State on
Mars and elsewhere would become mistaken as the will of a fictional invisible creator of the universe going by the name
Yahwey, ELOHIM “Creator, Mighty and Strong”, EL SHADDAI “God Almighty,”, ADONAI “My Lord”, or simply Ha-Shem (“The
Name”). This allowed the Deep State to communicate the will of God through cathedrals, telepaths, prophecy, visions, and
even special artifacts. Using its simulated God, the Deep State ordered humanity to commit endless religious warfare
against itself, dividing civilizations, and always benefiting from the conquest.

<PopImage src={require("./../conspiracy/vatican_suppressed_documents.jpg")} alt="Life on Mars"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

According to Fomenko’s New Chronology, the starting date for modern civilization, Year Zero, was shifted forward in time
to the special year of 1053 AD by the Roman Catholic Church. Originally, Year Zero marked the end of Earth’s formation
events and the beginning of modern civilization, stable calendars, travel, and communication. Today, the same Catholic
Church hoards these ancient artifacts of our shared history in
a [53 mile tunnel](https://www.history.com/news/step-into-the-vaticans-secret-archives) underneath Vatican City. Many
ancient sites are still buried from the MudFlood. Only in the last 30 years have enough new artifacts been found and
made available to the public allowing us to complete the story that was hidden.

## No Supernatural Influence

<PopImage src={require("./../cosmology/hollow_earth/flat_earth_controlled_opposition2.jpg")}
          alt="Controlled Opposition: Flat Earth"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

We should only subscribe to scientific concepts that can be demonstrated *logically*, in a laboratory, or otherwise.
Real science is reproducible, reliable, and verifiable. For example, Saturnian Cosmology relies on the theoretical
foundation of the Electric Universe to correlate religious myths with interplanetary cataclysms seen in proximity
to the Earth by humanity. Mythical archetypes like the Thunderbolt of the Gods were then reproduced by the SAFIRE
project [in a laboratory](https://safireproject.com/project/genesis.html).

The word **God** comes from the word *good*, and **Devil** comes from the word *evil* - defined as the opposite of
anything good. Both good and evil are observed in nature and need no further influence. This hypothesis proposes that
the invisible ‘supreme being’ known as God is actually a human construct invented by the Deep State in ancient times,
and it benefited that same Deep State to keep up the divine charade this whole time. We are ruling out the influence of
invisible Gods, devils, bug-like / octopus-like / or otherwise repulsive-looking aliens, a Galactic Federation, a
‘matrix simulation’, 5th Dimension, Mandela effect, magic, prophecy, and time-travel.

## Predictive Programming

          alt="Predictive Programming: Revelation of the Method"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The MFEE Hypothesis relies on the concept of *Predictive Programming* as a primer for navigating truth in the age of
disinformation. This theory (sometimes
called [Revelation of Method](https://exsplanet.blogspot.com/2009/12/revelation-of-method-predictive.html)) suggests
that Deep State agents deliberately leave hints of future events in popular fiction such as books, tv, movies, video
games, and news outlets. This is accomplished by the centralization of media, illustrated by Hollywood’s domination of
the world movie industry, and by categorizing something real as fiction, or something that isn’t real, as fact. The goal
of this method is to align public opinion with long term plans of the Deep State. Would-be dissenters of these plans
then tend to identify themselves early, allowing time for their opinions to be studied and an _official_
counter-narrative cultivated. This eventually leads to the public fighting each other and failing to find the real
culprit of their woes. [Michael A. Hoffman II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_A._Hoffman_II) states:

> "The purpose behind the 'Revelation of the Method' is the implied consent of the populace. If no resistance is raised
> when they reveal the truth, the cryptocracy is free to continue to follow the satanic precept. 'DO WHAT THOU WILT IS
> THE WHOLE OF THE LAW.' In other words, when the cryptocracy reveals their evil manipulations and the MAJORITY of the
> people don't care, its checkmate."

# Causality

In journalism, students are taught to
answer [six key questions](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/the-journalistic-six)
to allow the reader to approach a topic from various angles. Who, What, Where, When, How, and Why. Instead of
systematically dismissing mountains of testimony from our ancestors, as historians tend to do, lets **consider it** and
allow the hi-story to tell itself. We owe it to our *ancestors and our descendents both* to find the answers to these
questions.

          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

The *MudFlood Energetic Event Hypothesis* proposes that the unexplained MudFlood memories collected from around the
world starting in the early 19th century were caused by a single energetic calamity. This planet-scale energy coursed
across
the Earth’s surface, tearing it up and tossing matter miles into the air resulting in the destruction and re-shaping of
land masses and the covering up of cities across the planet with mud. Entire mountain ranges were pulled out of the
ground in dendritic patterns by positive electric discharge while negative discharge tore canyons out of the earth -
identical to the lightning scarring seen across the surface of Mars.

The emptied buildings of the “reset areas”, recently cleared of life, were then repopulated by orphan trains forming the
first cargo cults. Train tracks were promptly built across America, Europe, and Asia supplying humans and cargo.
Similarly, the first insane asylums were constructed across the world - everywhere the tracks led - with the purpose of
containing the memory of the Great Reset. Excavations of this buried world continued throughout the 19th and 20th
centuries, but instead of revealing the discoveries - they were surreptitiously kept secret, redacted, and even
out-right lied about. Of all the popular conspiracy theories that exist around the internet, the Mud Flood Energetic
Event stands out, opening eyes and blowing minds, and yet no hypothesis has been presented to explain _how_ it happened.

Deductively, such an event would have required a substantial release of energy to move trillions of tons of debris many
thousands of miles. We have to look for the source, because without the energy - there’s no MudFlood. For example, St.
Helens in 1980 erupted releasing 24 megatons of thermal energy resulting in 3 million cubic meters of volcanic mudflows
known as “lahars” being transported over 27 km. So,

## How did the MFEE Happen?

<PopImage src={require("./predictive_programming_simpsons_space_laser.jpg")}
          alt="Predictive Programming: Interplanetary Space Laser in The Simpsons"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The Mud Flood Energetic Event was caused by an interplanetary assault upon the Earth by humans who inhabit the planet
Mars. The method used to achieve this event was the construction of large-scale Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) on Mars
fired at Earth during opposition (a planetary alignment). These precision instruments of war devastating sovereign
kingdoms and airships, wiping out entire continents and islands. Locations that were not pre-selected for destruction
instead experienced heavy MudRains composed of the debris from the targeted regions, as well as catastrophic secondary
electric discharge.

After the DEWs heated the Earth’s surface enough to create a volcanic region known as the Ring of Fire, a secondary
negative discharge arced across America and Asia carving out such structures as the Grand Canyon and forming the tallest
mountain regions like Everest and the Colorado Rockies. This secondary discharge may have been unintentional as it added
a significant volume of material to the MudFlood Event that covered Eastern America and Western Europe. It also left
behind clues too big to be covered up.

The trigger for this event was the World War of 1812 when Napoleon’s army invaded the American-Syberian Rus-Horde Empire
from both East and West, burning down Roman-style architecture like the Kremlin and church that later became the
American White House. Officially, Napoleon’s nearly 600,000 person army was defeated in Syberia. In this hypothetical,
Napoleon’s invasion was successful, threatening hundreds of years of Deep State plans in less than a decade. This forced
the Deep State’s hand, requiring a correction of the most extreme nature - a cataclysmic reset of life on Earth. The
Deep State chose not to reveal itself or its technology in this event, knowing the survivors would defer to the church’s
conclusion - that the defeat of Napoleon was a divine intervention by an angry creator god.

          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

## Where was the MFEE?

The primary target for this event was the new French Empire under Napoleon and its allies around the world. The
secondary target was the old enemy of the Deep State - the splintered Rus-Horde Empire which the west referred to as the
Great Tartary. The primary goal of this maximal damage campaign was to eliminate all temporal resistance to the Deep
State’s plans and prevent a human empire from ever reorganizing on Earth again. The secondary goal was to preserve the
churches and mosques of the Rus-Horde Empire, stealing its history, redacting its indigenous Hoardian languages into
Latin Root, splintering it’s religious icons, and rebranding it as the “Holy” Roman Empire.

<PopImage src={require("./secondary_negative_discharge.jpg")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Secondary Negative Discharge"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The Rus-Horde Empire broke up in 1775 as a result of the defeat of Siberian war chief Pugachev by Russian General
Alexander Suvorov in the Cossack Rebellion. Up until that point, Tartarian vassal states spanned every continent. Now
these states would fall under the influence of the new Latin Empire. Those who resisted the church edict were eliminated
and their descendants enslaved. The mythical Kingdoms of the Pacific Islands were systematically annihilated -
electrically machined into lifeless atolls. Fortresses as far north as Scotland were annihilated leaving behind melted
ruins. The Giants of western America and eastern Eurasia were eradicated leaving behind hundreds of thousands of
[burial mounds](http://www.wisconsinmounds.com/DestroyedMounds.html). Land masses like Zelandia, Lemuria, and the Bering
Land Bridge were procedurally carved out using a negative
discharge leaving submerged continents. Mesas, never before seen on Earth, formed across Western America, North Africa,
and the Middle East. Mountains melted in Australia. Alchemic electrical scarring left painted rainbow canyons in China
and Tibet. Many Tartarian cathedrals like in St Petersburg and Salt Lake City harnessed the electric onslaught and
survived.

<PopImage src={require("./grand_canyon_criscross_lightning_scar.jpg")}
          alt="MudFlood Evidence: Grand Canyon CrisCross Scaring"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

The American west coasts were hit by an uncontrollable secondary negative electric discharge that arced across the
continent leaving behind a snaking electric scar over a thousand miles long - forming the Colorado River. In the dry
desert region the discharge became so large in amplitude that it tore into the Earth creating the Grand Canyon and the
Great Basin. Such dendritic scarring and incredible red rock formations like this are found nowhere else on Earth; yet
are seen across the surface of Mars - a planet which experienced intense negative electric discharge in the distant
past. Andrew Hall describes how electric discharges sculpted the american SouthWest:


> “... the land was zapped, carved and seared by electrical storms that could have happened last year, so fresh looked
> the marks of evidence."_


As the wreckage from these land masses filled the earth’s atmosphere and moved further away from the targeted zones,
this debris cooled and fell to Earth as “Mud”. Western Europe and Eastern America were hit by Mudfloods. Online today,
one can find many pictures of Tartarian buildings in America, Europe where the earth level has risen significantly above
the ground floor with no explanation given. Also one can find various paintings of an event where reddish mud known as
“BloodRain” fell from the sky.

    MudFlood Evidence:
    The Sphinx, a well-known MudFlood Structure, was buried up to its head in sand until archaeologists excavated it.
    The original Sphinx was OSIRIS, the *Tri-Form God* representing the planet Saturn, with Venus for a nose and Mars as
    an
    elongated beard. In Egyptian Mythology, during the Exodus, OSIRIS fell apart into separate pieces. The Jesuits
    rebuilt
    the sphinx representing the RESURRECTION of Osiris, and the return of the pyramidal slave empire. The Egyptian
    population thus fell under the rule of the Jesuits...

    In 1801, by ripping off the nose and beard, Napoleon's army had defaced the Sphinx demonstrating to the Egyptians

    their ancient God OSIRIS had not returned and that the Jesuits spoke for no Gods.

By 1812, Napoleon had invaded Moscow with an army of half a million soldiers and burned the Kremlin to the ground,
ending the christian european schism over Jerusalem. At the exact same time, his army in America invaded the Colonies
and burned the White House to the ground reversing the American Revolution and ending the slave trade. Napoleon had not
only liberated Europe and Asia, but America as well. The official story is that the British burned the White House in a
sea-based assault, but in 1812 England was still a vassal state of the failing Rus-Horde Empire and would have had no
interest in destroying their own colonies’ churches. Instead, Napoleon’s army attacked from the Louisiana territory,
traversing through American lands forbidden to the English and Spanish. Napoleon had convinced the Native Americans to
let the French soldiers pass through their lands and attack an enemy. Why would the American Giants agree to such a
thing? Because they remembered the Church’s
[*Requerimiento of 1513*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Requirement_of_1513) outlining the native’s choice -
slavery and annihilation - threatening their families with subjection to the “yoke and obedience of the Church and of
their Highnesses”. They also remembered efforts by the *Rus-Horde Empire* to impose taxation and usury upon American
lands leading up to the Townshend Acts of 1767 and the Boston Tea Party of 1773 when Mohawk Giants tossed 342 chests of
tea into the harbor in protest. Napoleon had offered the Americans a much better option - a Republic, like France had.
But to do that, he’d have to win the war. With the Americans on Napoleon’s side it seemed nothing but a Divine
Intervention would preempt Napoleon’s victory and the Deep State’s destruction.

## Who caused the MFEE?

<PopImage src={require("./1557_lycosthenes_rain_of_stones_meteorite.jpg")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: A deadly rain of stones. Woodcut with

          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The entity known as the Deep State is as old as humanity itself and is located in all the secret places of the Earth, as
well as places we were told Humans cannot live, like on planet Mars. In their desperation to stop Napoleon, they
employed use of large-scale DEWs on Mars that would become the instrument that reversed the victories of the Napoleonic
wars, annihilating his army along with the infrastructure of the French Empire and its allies. Between 1812 and 1860,
the Mars DEWs eliminated all threats to the Deep State on Earth and set the stage for a reset of history. By doing it
this way, the Deep State covered up it’s own involvement while striking the fear of God into the survivors who had
little choice but to accept the Church’s conclusion - that Napoleon’s defeat was Divine Retribution by God.

<PopImage src={require("./1844_blood_rain.jpg")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Buried Cities"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

During the 40+ years of the MudFlood Event, the Earth became an unlivable desert. If the Deep State was the cause of the
MudFlood, then they were in a unique position to become the saviors of humanity as life on earth began to die at
increasing rates. Playing God, the Deep State chose a new set of Israelites to survive the apocalypse. Israelite means -
**one who wrestles with God**. These “chosen” humans were kept alive via cargo (or “mana”) from a mysterious supplier
that
posed itself as the Creator God of the Universe. Eventually, this same God offers the Israelits a slave contract known
as *The Mosaic Covenent* or *“10 Commandments”* and promises if they live by the contract, that they will be delivered
to a
promised land. So, after surviving the **40+ years wandering the MudFlooded Earth desert**, this “God” delivers each
Israelite group to the relative ‘Promised Land’, as promised! Those Israelites who disobeyed God’s command quickly
perished, either denied cargo and starved, or were slaughtered by their peers in an attempt to appease *God’s wrath*.
Events of the Mudflood were then further redacted into the ‘Old Testament’, merged with ancient stories, and mass
distributed.

<PopImage src={require("./YorkRetreat.jpg")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: *The York Retreat* Insane Asylum"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

With the defeat of Napoleon came another **Great Reset** and a return of Babylonian-style Deep
State ruler-ship - everything the French revolution stood against: Slavery and debt prisons. Usury and taxes.
Secret Societies. Bloodline Aristocracies. Forced mass worship and labor.
[Pledges of Allegiance](https://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm).
[False Flag Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror).
Endless Wars. Genocide & Population control. Planned obsolescence, famine, & scarcity.
Pandora's Box was opened once again.

The Deep State would continue covering up its tracks by re-classifying all threatening literature as
*“Fantasy” or “Science Fiction"*. All references to advanced technology or life on Mars would become suppressed - unless
it was categorized as fiction. Those who resisted the Reset disappeared into new or converted insane asylums across the
planet. In North America, large-scale asylums were constructed and maintained in Baltimore, New Orleans, Madison N.J.,
and New York and run by the government with a heavy church involvement. Sometimes the asylums were built and maintained
directly by the regional church, like the York Retreat run by Quakers. Under the guise of mental health, patients who
remembered the pre-MudFlood world were sequestered, tortured, left to rot to death in small cells. Patients were
referred to as [*lunatics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunatic).

## When was the MFEE?

<PopImage src={require("./map_california_island.jpg")}
          alt="MudFlood Evidence: California as an Island, and No Grand Canyon!"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

Most MudFlood researchers will place the event in the early 19th century where we find an abundance of photos of “reset
cities” cleared of life, and Tartarian buildings and other monuments buried stories into the ground. There are also
quite a few world maps dated before the 19th century which differ significantly from later maps. For example, in North
America the state of California appeared as an island larger than the United Kingdom. There is no sign of the Grand
Canyon, or the 1400 mile Colorado River. In old maps of Hindustan, the tributaries of the Ganges are significantly
different, and there is no sign of the 1500 mile Himalayan Mountain range. Russia released maps from their historical
archives of a vast Tartarian empire in Siberia in 2014, in response to a coup in Ukraine. In maps of Tartaria, again
there’s no Himalayan mountains, Tibetan Plateau, or Great Wall of China. The land was inhabited, decorated with a
majestic balance of water, trees, and natural boundaries - nothing like the uninhabitable wasteland we know today as
Siberia. The dating of early photos and old maps suggest the likelihood that the Reset was triggered early in the 19th
century. But in what year?

<PopImage src={require("./map_1812_war.jpg")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: World War of 1812"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

The most significant recorded event to occur in the 19th century was the War of 1812. Modern historians split it into 2
wars; one between the British ‘empire’ and their American colonies, and another between the French and Russian Empires.
However, the Kingdom of France had been involved in the Colony wars since 1682 and were still just as involved in 1812.
Similarly, on the European front, England joined forces with Russia against France in the 1809 War of the Fifth
Coalition.


<PopImage src={require("./map_1812_napoleon_defeat.jpg")} alt="MudFlood Evidence: Napoleon's Unexplainable Defeat"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}/>

The World War of 1812 split the world in half and battle was joined in every continent. Napoleon’s advanced army failed
to occupy Russia and retreated in defeat, losing half a million soldiers in the process, all the while rarely engaging
the inferior Russian forces. Decades after the war, French investigators like Charles Joseph Minard would attempt to
explain the unprecedented losses mathematically, insisting that over 400 thousand soldiers were lost due to starvation,
disease, and desertions. Curiously only 30k soldiers are said to have died in an actual battle, and there was only one
battle - at [Borodino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Borodino). Modern historians attribute this historic
military failure to extreme negligence and a hypothetical Napoleon “complex”. This mundane contradictory explanation was
inscribed by the victorious [Sixth Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Sixth_Coalition) and fails to
take into account a great deal of 19th century testimony following the war.

<PopImage src={require("./blood_rain_priest_1888.jpg")} alt="MudFlood Event: BloodRain & Priest

"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}/>

For example, the 1812 Overture, which was written in 1880 under Tsarist orders, gives us clues as to how the 1812 war
was really won. The lyrics go:

    “Mighty Lord, preserve us from jeopardy. Take Thee now our faith and loud crying in penitence. ... And to our land bring peace”

Tchaikovsky notoriously hated the 1812 Overture - likely resenting the Theonationalistic subject matter. Similar lyrics
can be found in European national anthems. From 1816 to 1833, the Russian Imperial Anthem lyrics beseech God to “Save
the Czar”. Throughout the 19th century British, Prussian, Saxony and Bavarian National Anthems stated: “God Save the
King/Queen” depending on the gender of the current monarch. Why do so many European countries have identical anthems
imploring a divine influence to intervene in times of trouble. Because the victory over Napoleon in the war of 1812 was
remembered as a “divine“ intervention.

Religion [always plays a part in war](https://henrich.fas.harvard.edu/files/henrich/files/henrich_et_al-2019-nature_human_behaviour.pdf)
and clearly played a significant role in the 1812 War, therefore we can assume historians are biased when it comes to
answering _who_ burned down all the churches, and most importantly _why_. They will insist that Tsar Alexander I ordered
his most holy and ancient Russian temple - the Kremlin - to be destroyed so that it wouldn’t be destroyed by the French.
This of course makes no sense. After Napoleon's defeat in Russian, Tsar Alexander I issued Shishkov's
famous [manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shishkov) which stated:

> In this deed we recognize Divine Providence itself. We will learn from this great and terrible example to be the mild
> and humble executor of the laws and will of God, not like those who have fallen away from the faith, those desecrators
> of the temples of God.

By *Fallen Desecrators of God’s Temple*, the Tsar was referring to Napoleon’s Army who, inspired by the anti-clerical
French Revolution, **won the world war of 1812** burning down every church they encountered. The Great Reset and
MudFlood Event of the 19th century allowed historians to redact human history concealing Napoleon’s victory. They
deliberately hid the fact that the anti-theistic French army had burned down both the Kremlin and White House churches
in continuity with the events of
the [French Revolution.](https://www.history.com/news/notre-dame-fire-french-revolution)
Napoleon’s goal was to eliminate the bureaucratic authority of the Catholic, Protestant, and Greek Orthodox Churches,
which controlled all world governments. By burning the churches and temples, the
slow-and-go [Jesuit plan for world domination](https://brill.com/view/journals/jjs/5/1/article-p33_33.xml?language=en)
had been foiled at the highest levels, turned on itself, freeing the Earth from
the [yoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Requirement_of_1513#Text)
of [centralized religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_religion).

The Deep State knew that if they exposed their technology to reverse the achievements of the Napoleonic wars, it would
be only a matter of time until their clandestine ruler-ship would be exposed and then lost completely. To reassert
control of the religions of Earth, while continuing to hide their existence, they needed everyone to be convinced that
Napoleon’s alliance was defeated by God.

## Return of Slavery

1. [The MAAFA](http://nationaljuneteenth.com/Maafa.html) is a Kiswahili term for "terrible occurrence" or "great
disaster". It refers to the Black Holocaust when millions of Africans died allegedly during the journey of captivity
from the west coast of Africa to the shores of America. This memory may instead be the world war of 1812 and the
subsequent return of slavery afterwards. French Race Census became illegal starting FR of 1789. Revolution concepts
like universal suffrage, abolition of slavery, and citizenship promoted Afro-French immigration. Thomas-Alexandre
Dumas became France’s first black general in 1793.  \
Between 1807 and 1860, the Royal Navy's ‘suppression’ Squadron seized thousands of free ships of the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans and sold them (slavery was banned) to the Portuguese-run TransAtlantic Slave Trade. During this time,
the British navy relocated 150,000 Africans from the French empire to the British colony of Sierra Leone to work in
Sugar Plantations.
2. Michael Mann, basing his figures on those provided by Justin McCarthy, states that between 1821 and 1922, a large
number of Muslims were expelled from Southeast Europe as Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia declared independence. Mann
describes these events as "murderous ethnic cleansing on a stupendous scale not previously seen in Europe".

Statue of Liberty). British wanted to prevent. \
Built by machine, Suez flooded the Nile starting 1869
until [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile). \

 6. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of
the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of
a "step-over" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent
subsidence.

in many other locations the wall is in disrepair. The wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build
houses and roads

## Orphan Trains

1. [https://youtu.be/DP0qV2DN3mo?t=378](https://youtu.be/DP0qV2DN3mo?t=378)
2. According to the museum’s website, the Orphan Train Movement transported around 250,000 needy, neglected, and
orphaned children from New York to other regions of the United States and Canada
from [1854 to 1929](https://vitabrevis.americanancestors.org/2015/10/orphan-trains/).
3. In 1850 the U.S. population was twenty-three million. By 1880 it had more
than [doubled](https://hometownbyhandlebar.com/?p=32125).
4. The mid-1800s wasn’t a good time to be a kid in New York City. Mud and excrement puddled in the streets. Children and
adults slept in sagging, damp shacks. Dirty homes, dirty roads, dirty clothes, and modern sanitation waited decades
away. Only the luckiest of these immigrants escaped, since few businesses paid this first wave of American
immigrants—mostly Irish, British, and German—a living wage. From 1854 to 1929, these trains, sponsored either by
government funding or sponsorship by wealthy philanthropists, sent roughly 200,000 children to the Midwest (with most
to Indiana in the first decade). Applications were accepted from virtually any area except those in slave-owning
southern states to preserve the race-based plantation system 30 degrees to the equator. \
One veteran of the orphan train, a Missouri Orphan Train veteran described her foster parents in clear terms: “They
weren’t mean, they were cold, and they showed no feeling toward me. When I was 15 or 16 I decided I’d live in a
garbage can before I’d stay there any longer.” \

## Resettable cities across the planet today

1. [Victorian-style Architecture](https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/victorian-architecture) may be
influenced by the need to protect from the possibility of a future Mudflood event after 1830.

## Latinization

1. The Renaissance
 1. “rediscovery” of classical philosophy, literature and art.
2. The Jesuits attempt to rewrite history

3. Pacific Ocean Name (vs Atlantic)
4. Johnny appleseed

4. War of the Worlds
5. Star wars
6. James bond
7. Final Fantasy (movie & games)

## Dinosaur bones & Carbon Dating deception

# Will there be another MF?

    No.

# Alternate Theories

1. Hydraulic mining
2. Unrelated Disasters
 1. Dust Bowl (cover up)
 2. Tunguska Event
 3. Other Energetic Event that's not caused by a DEW
 4. Meteor Strikes
 5. [Great Blizzard of 1888](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Blizzard_of_1888)
3. Nuclear war
4. Buildings damaged to make new buildings
 6. Great Wall of China
 7. Colosseum of Rome,Italy

# Hypothesis Checklist

1. Falsifiability - Hypothesis is wrong if
 1. Another energy source to explain the movement of mud
 2. Another explanation for MudFlood buildings
 3. A collection of unrelated disasters can explain the MudFlood
 4. Another explanation for Melted Buildings and fortresses found world-wide
 5. Napoleon legitimately failed to invade Moscow in 1812
 6. Life on Mars can be disproven
 7. If recently created locations like Australia, Israel, China, India, or the Grand Canyon have a history before
1776/1812
2. Parsimony “Occam’s Razor” - Hypothesis excessive if
 8. A simpler explanation for - MudFlood / melted buildings, the added grand canyon or break up of Mu continent, and
the reset of civilization - than a space laser on Mars targeting geo-political enemies on Earth.
3. Scope & Fruitfulness
 9. By limiting the scope of this event to our solar system affairs, we can predict that this event is not repeatable
and will never happen again
4. Conservatism
 10. The conclusion of this hypothesis does not “fit” with any modern knowledge-systems, and instead suggests that
academia as we know it is little more than an elaborate system of control meant to obfuscate any and all truth.

# Misc:

Predictive Programming in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.
Hayao Miyazaki's #1 best anime features a post-mudflood apocalyptic world, poisoned topsoil world-wide, a prophecy  of a saviour and "promised" land after wandering in the desert, and Earth destroyed by human made weapon. This is yet another example of Revelation-Of-The-Method predictive programming driven by a MudFlood narrative and thus providing many clues as to the unredacted true story behind it.

stolenhistory.org or Flat-Earthers like Philipp Druzhinin. You’ll find that when approaching the actual truth of any

of your investigation - and into controlled opposition conclusions; New Age movements like 5D, Flat Earth, Fetus-looking
Ancient Aliens, or invisible Gods. Keep an open mind, Inspector - and happy investigating!
