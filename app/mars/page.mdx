# The Deep State is on Mars

This article has been rewritten with the following updates.
Originally I said the Martian appearances in the War of the Worlds book must have been a redaction by H.G. Wells,
but now I believe that the book's text was not redacted, and the human Martians were hidden
within biomechanical host bodies - never seen outside the host.
I originally thought a revolution of sorts must have occurred on Mars
in order to consolidate enough power to issue an attack upon Earth.
Now I believe the ability for one faction to assume rulership on Mars was a direct
result of telepaths being wiped out by the secondary discharge that occurred
during the MudFlood Energetic Event
which (possibly unintentionally) destroyed Martian surface cities as well.

## What is the Deep State?

The **Deep State** is an international technocratic cabal that imposes systems of control over
all human civilization within its influence.
On April 27, 1961, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City,
[President John F. Kennedy said:](https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/american-newspaper-publishers-association-19610427)

> For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
> that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence.
> On infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections,
> on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.
> It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the
> building of a tightly-knit, highly efficient machine that combines
> military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations

Kennedy was referring to the USSR in his speech, but unlike the West, the USSR was officially
[anti-imperial](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/843077/summary)
and had no colonization or policy of expansion in its 70-year history.
Instead, land was annexed by non-covert means after Russia suffered a major Nazi invasion backed by the Deep State
Allied Powers, winning, and then counter-attacking Europe to remove the bureaucracies imposed by the Nazis.
In the Great Patriotic War (WW2) the USSR, at a huge cost, had won a major victory against the Deep State.
Regardless, in his speech Kennedy (who was a major Hitler supporter) was attempting to rebrand the USSR as the *only*
Deep State in the world.

The [dubious assassination](https://mdcp.nwaonline.com/news/2023/dec/07/deep-state-deceived-nation-60-years-on-kennedy/)
of JFK reminded humanity that an *invisible* technocratic influence did indeed exist, and it apparently had the final
say on major events in Earth's history, imposing its jurisdiction over every human - without our consent (or awareness).

## Where is the Deep State?

**Martial Law. Maritime. Marshalling. Marching. Mergers. Martyrdom. Murder. Marring.**
These familiar terms of conquest are named after the planet of conquest: **Mars**.
The origins of these words suggest systems of control imposed upon us
by humans who associate themselves with the planet Mars.
The headquarters of the **Deep State** is located in the secret places of the Earth, as well as places we were told
Humans cannot live, like on the *inside* of the planet Mars.

The Deep State cannot be identified by its locations alone, but rather by the literature and iconography promoted by
its agents. Throughout history, all Earth literature became compromised, redacted, and encrypted by Deep State
terminology that was not designed for the rest of the species to understand. This is why nearly all our important
documents were converted to Latin - math, science, history, religion, health, music, binomial nomenclature etc.
By converting all languages to their 'latin roots', our species became *illiterate* to all of its prior knowledge
while those who read and speak Latin became exclusively able to decrypt our literature (like *matrix code*).

## Why would the Deep State be on Mars?

[Ancient testimony](http://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html) tells us the true origin story of
Earth, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, Neptune, Uranus, and the Sun.
The real history of our solar system is recent, not millions or billions of years long.
Earth shares an incubated safe space with **Mercury, Venus, and Mars** that allows for periodic quantum entanglement
without interference.
Occasionally, [Birkeland currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkeland_current) will flow between these planets.
Mercury may be a viable quantum-tunnel travel location.
However, the most natural and safest periodic quantum gates exist between Earth and Mars.
These gates were formed during interplanetary discharges of electricity, the same kind of
[lightning scarring](https://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050408marineris.htm) that carved the
[Grand Canyons](https://www.wanderlustmagazine.com/inspiration/grand-canyons-around-the-world/).

This quantum-entanglement technology allowed the *Deep State* to establish a *Pyramidal Empire* on Earth
and Mars in ancient times. This inland empire still
dominates [inner solar system](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/focus-areas/inner-solar-system) affairs today.

## What is 'Quantum Entanglement'?

All pyramids were built around naturally occurring star-gates that no longer function today.
The [pyramid structure](https://www.ancientpages.com/2018/07/31/amazing-discovery-great-pyramid-of-giza-and-its-chambers-concentrate-electromagnetic-energy/)
is built around the gate to make it stable and safe for passage.
There are [pyramid](https://www.sciencealert.com/sorry-egypt-but-sudan-is-the-pyramid-capital-of-the-world)
structures all over the Earth, not just in Egypt and South America.
They are not tombs for Egyptian Pharaohs.
They were not created by [Ancient Aliens](https://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens).
The enduring mystery of the pyramids has spawned decades
of [debates](http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread357821/pg1)
and [conspiracy theories](https://www.eyeofthepsychic.com/hawass/) with no consensus.

## What is the 'Pyramidal Empire'?

The questions of who built the Pyramids of earth, and why, represent
the [biggest unsolved mystery](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151113-why-do-we-still-not-know-whats-inside-the-pyramids)
of human construction projects in history.
In times of [cataclysm](/chronology), humans on each planet would uncover natural electromagnetic ley lines
and build Pyramids and Ziggurats upon those locations.
There are [hundreds of pyramids](https://mysteriousunexplainedhistory.com/how-many-pyramids-are-there-around-the-world/)
the size of Giza _or bigger_ built along the Earth's Equator,
including [hundreds of thousands](https://www.quora.com/How-many-pyramids-exist-in-the-world)
of smaller pyramidal structures.
In less than 200 years, humans built all the pyramids in
Egypt, [Sudan](https://www.sciencealert.com/sorry-egypt-but-sudan-is-the-pyramid-capital-of-the-world),
Mesopotamia, England, China, and in the South America Andes.

  The Bosnian pyramids have flattened tops, like Latin and South American pyramids, and are constructed with stone slabs.
  Thermal imaging suggests that they cool off more quickly than surrounding areas,
  and they are believed to contain hollow areas
</PopImage>

This network of pyramids allowed the *Deep State* to rule earth by employing
real-time communication between each location.
This enabled the critical function of *simulating* gods and other visions at each location.
Simulated deity worship became the primary instrument of *Deep State* control and allowed
them to establish the [Egyptian Empire](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/ancient-egypt)
which lasted for centuries.
In addition to communication, each pyramid
enabled [quantum teleportation](https://www.reddit.com/r/PastSaturnsRings/comments/iwl8we/the_saturn_stargate/)
between locations during periods of planetary alignment.
The concept of a *simulated deity* appearing within a temple has been redacted into the
children's story [Wizard of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz).

The *Pyramidal Empire* collapsed following the Exodus Event of 1492 B.C. when changing conditions within the solar
system prevented the pyramids from functioning ever again.
The *Deep State* would embed itself further in the secret places of the world.
The humans of Mars would become *cut off* from Earth, unable to return for the rest of their lives.

The inner realms are more prolific than the outside where we live, however resources on Mars are limited
which forces humans on Mars to leech off of Earth's resources to survive.

## Evidence of Life on Mars

*No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century...*
that the twentieth century would label over 300 years of Mars Literature as 'Science Fiction'.

[Athanasius Kircher](http://www.philsp.com/articles/pastmasters_01.html) (1602–1680),
[Emanuel Swedenborg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16044/16044-h/16044-h.htm) (1688–1772), and others
wrote in detail about Earth contact with Mars, including the first voyages to the planet.
In 1784, [Sir William Herschel](https://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/mystique/history/1700/), British Astronomer Royal,
studied Mars with telescopes he built himself. Herschel believed that *all* the planets were inhabited and that
there were even intelligent beings living in a cool area under the surface of the hollow Sun!

### Giovanni Exposes Mars to the Public

During the planet's "great opposition" of 1877, [Giovanni Schiaparelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Schiaparelli#Mars) observed a dense network of
linear structures on the surface of Mars which he called "canali" (Channels in Italian)
leading to speculation about artificial construction and the potential for intelligent life on Mars.
In his book *Life on Mars*, he wrote:

> Rather than true channels in a form familiar to us, we must imagine depressions in the soil
that are not very deep, extended in a straight direction for thousands of miles,
over a width of 100, 200 kilometres and maybe more. I have already pointed out that,
in the absence of rain on Mars, these channels are probably the main mechanism by which
the water (and with it organic life) can spread on the dry surface of the planet.

<PopImage {...require("./mars_canals5.jpg?w=360")}
          alt="Mars Canals 4"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleRight}`}>
  "Mars and Its Canals" by Percival Lowell, published in 1906 details Lowell's theories and observations about the
  canals of Mars, which he believed were built by an intelligent civilization to transport water across the planet
</PopImage>

### Percival Lowell Maps Mars in Detail

From 1880 to 1895, [Percival Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_Lowell#Canals_of_Mars) studied Mars
extensively at his observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and made intricate drawings of canals, oases, cities,
and other "non-natural features".
He described in detail the vast skein of mechanically constructed canal systems that traversed the red planet
unmistakably grown around the Antarctic regions.
Lowell then published his views in three books: Mars (1895),
Mars and Its Canals (1906), and Mars As the Abode of Life (1908).
Percival Lowell states in the New York Times in 1907:

> “It is a direct sequitur from this that the planet is at present the abode of intelligent constructive life,
> I may say in this connection that the theory of such life upon Mars was in no way an
> a-priori hypothesis on my part, but deduced from the outcome of observation,
> and that my observations since have fully confirmed it.
> No other supposition is consonant with all the facts here.”

### Lowell announces Life on Mars 1907, and then dies.

After making this announcement in the New York Times his health mysteriously and rapidly deteriorated.
He died from a stroke in the middle of World War One on November 12, 1916, aged 61 and is buried on Mars Hill near his
Flagstaff observatory.
Lowell's announcement had the power to change the world in *positive* ways that nobody could have foreseen,
but instead, his announcement was perceived as a threat by the controlling faction of the inhabitants of Mars.

<PopImage {...require("./mars_life.jpg?w=640")}
          alt="Lowell announces Life on Mars"
          className="rounded-md m-auto"/>

If Martians influenced War on Earth, it is logical that The Great War may have been *triggered or accelerated*
by Lowell's announcement of Life on Mars.
Shortly after this, World War I changed the world in *negative* ways
that [nobody could have foreseen](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/45966335).
The same humans who contrived the Great Wars of the 20th Century could not have done so
without first having consolidated power on Mars - otherwise a competing faction might have spoiled the various plots
over time. How could one faction wield so much influence?

          Areas resembling melted cities are found on the surface of Mars, sometimes with distinguishable buildings.

## The Martian Catastrophe

It appears that in the late 18th century, humans on Mars were forced to intervene physically in Earthly affairs in order
to prevent the rebellion of Pugachev (1773) from spreading across the planet and destroying the authority of the
religious orders on Earth that Martians controlled
([Rex Bellator Plan](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Bellator)).
The Martians fired large-scale
[Directed Energy Weapons](https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-directed-energy-weapons/)
at earth to reverse the accomplishments of the rebellion.
However, it appears that whoever decided to fire the cannons at Earth either did not fully understand the risks involved,
or did not care.
Either way, in a desperate bid to defeat Pugachev, the cannons may have been fired **too rapidly** resulting in a
**secondary discharge** as the energy passed through the Earth at the target point, and exited the Earth from a secondary
point elsewhere. Mars was in opposition at the time, and thus the energy fired at the Earth would largely return to
Mars and cause further damage. This is potentially the reason why
[melted city ruins](https://www.unariunwisdom.com/ancient-city-ruins-on-mars/) tend to be found on Mars.

Science 'Fiction' predictive programming suggests that life on Mars has not reached exhaustion due to being
*very ancient*, but rather as a result of their planetary ecosystem taking a massive hit during the
MudFlood Energetic Event.
Clearly the majority of Martians did not agree with nor benefit from this attack on Earth;
in every version of the story the instigator of the war
(Ender, Terl, Palpatine, Goa'uld System Lord, Xenu, Marvin, Shaddam IV, Senior Elder etc.) was deposed exiled and/or
executed. Nevertheless, the Martian catastrophe resulted in a major power vacuum on Mars and Earth allowing
the Deep State survivors to exploit the situation, consolidate power, and *deliver* from *'Egypt'*
(i.e. The destroyed Rus-Horde Kingdom) the loyal *chosen* bloodlines to the *promised land* to
repopulate the *reset* cities.

### Technocrats Defeat Telepathic Factions

The clue to an additional reason why it may have been possible for one faction to assume control over Mars is given in both the
movie Archon Defender and the PC game Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds. In this predictive programming,
a planet endures a revolution as one faction that masters technology (but is devoid of spirit) wipes out all other
factions using a weapon that targets spiritual sensitivity i.e. telepathy or other energetic abilities.
If life on Mars was once largely telepathic (as implied by science fiction) it follows that all
factions which relied upon telepaths (who are sensitive to electromagnetic energy)
took a devastating hit in the MudFlood Energetic Event (MFEE) and never recovered.

> The uprising was a lie.
The epidemic was a lie.
The medical screening was a lie,
an excuse to identify the Shard Sensitive.
Then the disappearances started. - Archon Defender (2009)

> The Age of disillusionment and decay is Over.
I have never before witnessed a mass telepathic execution, but today, the remnants of our society have
displayed their disheartenment and desperation. - Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds PC (1998)

If this interpretation is correct, a question arises:
Did the technocrats who fired the cannons at Earth know that a *secondary discharge* would backfire and devastate
their own planet, essentially wiping out their *spiritual* rivals on Mars?
This answer may be why we see so many plots in science 'fiction' media that involve intelligent machines taking over
rulership of humanity; Terminator, Matrix, Wall-e, I Robot, Age of Ultron, Mitchells vs. Machines etc.

### Signs of civilization on the surface of Mars

The cities on Mars cannot be seen from Earth telescopes but natural canals, lakes, and oceans can be seen
as darker regions that change shape throughout the year.
Modern scientists attempt to [debunk](https://cosmicpursuits.com/2183/mars-observing-guide/)
this observable phenomenon by insisting the regions appear to change as a result of 'dust clouds'.
But what about the artificial-looking canals observed by Lowell?

<PopImage priority {...require("./mars_canals3.jpg?w=360")}
          alt="Artificial canals flood during Martian wet seasons providing desert cities with water"
          className={`[&>img]:rounded-md ${imageStyleLeft}`}>

</PopImage>

The Deep State may have planned to emerge into the public and reveal its presence on Earth and Mars to the world
if it had won any of the last 3 World Wars, but it lost all of them and was never able to rule the entire world at once.
Its existence had to remain hidden (i.e. deep), but poisoning Lowell wouldn't be enough.
In order to prevent life on Mars from being discovered, The Deep State had to prevent Lowell's observations
from being repeated by others.
If the cities and other ["non-natural features"](https://www.marsanomalyresearch.com/) were observable on Mars,
the jig would be up. Cities and canals would all have to be [erased](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23184799).
All the Humans who lived in these cities would have to return to the inner realms.
Those who refused would have to be convinced.


### All artificial Canals were erased

After the Martian surface cities were damaged or destroyed in the MFEE, water still flowed into them via the canals.
In order to convince the various life on Mars to abandon the surface cities the artificial canals observed by
Lowell and others would have to be filled-in by the same automated machines that originally built them.
As soon as the water stopped flowing, the cities were abandoned.
In 1962, the [Mariner missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_program) observed Mars at close range,
seeing no water, no cities, and no signs of life.
It is possible that all man-made features on the surface of Mars were dismantled between 1918 and 1962.
It was then claimed Mars as a 'dead' planet containing virtually no liquid water at all.

CERN colliders are essentially locations where an extremely
high amount of energy is placed all at once. When this happens,
a quantum entanglement is created between the source location,
and wherever that energy ends up flowing towards. Therefore,
so-called *quantum tunnels* can be built between locations
that have already experienced major interplanetary
[electric discharge](https://thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050509plasma-mythology.htm).
The larger the CERN facility, the more stable the tunnel, and the more stuff can be brought through it. 
Gates between planets are _periodic_, and depend entirely on the proximity of the planets to each other. It
shouldn't be a [surprise](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00173-2) that
CERN is right now building a facility 6 times larger than the current one.

## Martian influence on Earth affairs
Throughout history, humans on Mars have influenced Earth affairs. The primary means of influence was the compelling
obedience to Monotheism. The simple idea was to convince various factions on Earth that a single 'all powerful' deity
exists and must be worshiped in real-time to benefit from its reign. Over time, every religion was redacted from its
indigenous, typically polytheistic version. Humans on Mars would always be the primary benefactor, regardless of
what name was chosen for this invisible god:
Satan (i.e. Saturn), Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Belial,
YHWH, Adonai, Elohim, Jehovah, Shaddai, Ehyeh,
Ba'al, Elah, El Roi, Elyon, HaShem or just 'God'.

The point of the CERN Ceremony was to show *the humans on the other side of the quantum tunnel*
that Earth is fully obedient and systematically under complete control. This system of control is demonstrated
using a cavalcade of puppet presidents, popes, celebrities,
all the way down to the multitude of working-class laborers, also appearing obedient. The usage of occult
symbols also demonstrates obedience to various brands of control that existed throughout Earth's
history. The purveyors of this ceremony had one clear message for the other side: Humanity 
is ready to be ruled.

### Martians are Humans

After the MFEE devastated the Mars ecosystem, birth-rates would have plummeted across the planet as a result.
This is likely why we see so much predictive programming suggesting that Mars 'needs' women.
Therefore, it is very unlikely that any race or species other than humans (appearing like you and me)
inhabit Mars. If Martian humans actually had a different appearance from Earth humans, 'Deep State' style
infiltration schemes would be impossible to pull off.
In modern times, breeding on Earth became strictly controlled under "Marital" Wedlock.
Saturnian Cosmology reminds us that humans existed on Mars in the Golden Age.

### Predictive programming in Science Fiction / Fantasy Genre:

To understand the motivations behind *predictive programming*,
[transactional analysis](https://www.simplypsychology.org/transactional-analysis-eric-berne.html)
allows us to determine precisely what the viewer is being coerced into believing.
In other words we ask - What do they want us to believe?
Or - what do they *not* want us to believe?
Since the great [book-burning](http://www.revisionist.net/book-burning.html) of the 20th century,
there has been a persistent trend in surviving published media that injects
[predictive programming](https://u.osu.edu/vanzandt/2018/04/18/predictive-programming/) about 
our reality into science fiction and fantasy movies. The idea behind this
coordinated programming is that the audience is expected to
understand that these two categories are strictly *fiction*.

  Common predictive programming themes found in science fiction that may reflect reality
  include the Martians need for Earth women, roman empire references, and the normalization of 'mutants'
</PopImage>

As a result of this trick, any information exchanged in a science-fiction novel or motion picture is
automatically regarded
by the viewer (and their entire peer network) as *untrue*. Any time a dogma of a science establishment
(like NASA) is challenged, the *programming* will kick in and the challenge will be categorically dismissed.
In addition, horrific images are often associated with 'SciFi' and 'Fantasy' media, especially in the 80s.
The same tactic is used by Catholics who show their young children images of crucified adults.
*Fear is the most effective educational tool*.
All 20th century novels and [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_set_on_Mars) about
Mars describe it as unlivable and unattractive to Humans, and generally hostile to life. This is a major shift
from 19th century literature which describes Mars as being inhabited by
advanced humans who occasionally visit Earth on friendly terms.

#### Pyramid/StarGate Predictive Programming

The movie Star Gate (1994) attempts to categorically mythify the connection between real-life pyramids and
periodic star-gates into the realm of 'science fiction'
and highlights the persistent confusion among historians as to who built the pyramids and how and why they were
built. The movie differs from real-life by suggesting
'advanced technology' is required to build star gates. In real life, the pyramids themselves *were* the star
gates, and they did not function as depicted in the movie. In the very first scene of Star Gate,
during Daniel's Egyptology lecture,
a member of the audience laughingly suggests that _The Atlanteans_ as well as _The Martians_ built the Pyramids.
Well, this happens to be the truth.
However, This interaction is programming
meant to provoke the viewer into subconsciously considering and then
dismissing the possibility of pyramids being built for interplanetary
purposes by humans from _this_ solar system.

Total Recall (1990) suggests there are pyramids on Mars built by ancient aliens. This programming negates the possibility
that Martian pyramids were built recently by humans. The movie also suggests humans explode when exposed to Martian
atmosphere. This common programming gimmick associates 'space exploration' with horrific images.
Total Recall (2012) is a remake of the original with the pyramids and nearly all references to Mars removed.
In Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005), the Red Planet itself was inexplicably removed from the traditional
storyline as well.
Why remove Mars from the classic Mars stories? The Deep State  still attempts to remove the breadcrumbs from the trail
that leads back to them. Due to this redaction, aliens in science fiction seem far more *ancient* and *distant*
while the idea of *martians* seem even more hokey.

### Failure to reach Mars

Half of (7 of 14) planetary robotic missions by NASA have been sent to Mars and
a Human Mission to Mars was in the official NASA plans since the 1950s.
Why then after 70 years are we no closer to an actual human mission?
The current most realistic earliest launch date
is [2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars#Current_intentions_by_nations_and_space_agencies)
with an extra 10 - 30 years to get there. How old will you be when they land?
Conspiracy Theorist Alex Jones was famously
[censored](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17659026/alex-jones-deplatformed-misinformation-hate-speech-apple-facebook-youtube)
after a caller suggested there could be
[A child slave-colony on Mars](https://www.thedailybeast.com/nasa-denies-that-its-running-a-child-slave-colony-on-mars).
The high-profile censorship of Alex Jones ended the discussion, and a controlled opposition agent Robert David
Steele was brought in to mis-represent the original claim.
“We actually believe that there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children who were kidnapped and sent
into space on a 20-year ride”.
The '20 year ride' version made the claim seem more like science fiction,
and caused readers to lend even less credibility to
the story, while hiding any mention of the true method of travel: instantaneous quantum tunnels like CERN.
In the original caller's transcript,
the caller described the children being *born* into slavery while on Mars. This makes more sense, and leads
the reader to assume there may be a break-away civilizations of humans living on Mars.

Former CIA pilot John Lear and former Lockheed L-1011 Captain said that NASA astronauts flew to Mars in 1966.
Moreover, Lear believed that astronauts had been preparing for this mission especially long.
They introduced certain drugs into the body, allowing people to adapt to Martian climatic conditions.
Allegedly, those astronauts could breathe rarefied Martian air,
so NASA had the opportunity to launch humans on the red planet for a longer time.
Jacques Vallee claims that Air Force Colonel Ron Blackburn told him in May 1990 that he was
“convinced the government is working on UFOs” and that non-human Alien "abductions" are
[simulated](https://prepareforchange.net/2020/07/11/forced-faked-alien-abductions-were-conducted-by-the-cia-according-to-renowned-researcher/).
Blackburn said that the chances were “pretty good” that the US government was “fooling” UFO witnesses “by
special effects developed by psychological warfare”. Vallee additionally states,
“I have secured a document confirming that the CIA simulated UFO abductions in Latin America (Brazil and
Argentina) as psychological warfare experiments.”

  ancient myths and religious beliefs were based on a different celestial configuration where
  Saturn, not the Sun, was the central figure in the sky.
</PopImage>

## Mars was Atlantis

According to [Saturnian Cosmology](https://www.plasmacosmology.net/myth.html),
when Earth and Mars were still within Saturn's Orbit, Mars appeared above the Earth's North Pole
and was remembered as the 'island' of [Atlantis](https://www.thunderbolts.info/wp/2018/05/03/36-atlantis-the-disappearing-homeland/)
*Yggdrasil*, *The Tower of Babel*, *Ladder/Stairway/Rainbow Bridge to Heaven*, *Garden of Eden*
and many other myths. 
Above Mars was the plasmodial planet Venus which would continuously change shape forming star patterns and other symbols.
Fixed above Venus was the planet Saturn appearing as an immense ball (Baʻal) in the sky.
During this time, energy from the configuration penetrated the planets creating quantum entanglements
between the rocky planets Mercury, Earth and Mars. These entanglements were natural and stable. 
It was possible to instantly travel between the gate points by walking through the gates. 
Towards the beginning of the *Golden* age, there were no world empires, no kings, no war, no scarcity,
*"...and bird and beast and flower were one with man, and death was but a dream."* (Excalibur 1981).

There is no mention of the legend as Atlantis in any writer previous to Plato i.e. Homer, Pindar,
Herodotus, Aristotle etc.
In the [Timaeus](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1572/1572-h/1572-h.htm) Plato describes Atlantis
as a continent (i.e. Mars) *nearly as large as the Earth* that appears at the destination point of a
traversable quantum bridge known by the Greeks as the *Pillars of Heracles*:

> “For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which,
starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, 
and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks 
call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together;
and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands 
to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, 
lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a 
real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent.
Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, 
which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.”

  Authors such as N. A. Morozov and Immanuel Velikovsky
  suggested that ancient cultures may have viewed Saturn as a sun-like body
</PopImage>

The priests of Atlantis regarded the immense planet-god Saturn as a sentient Creator God of the Universe,
and were remembered for distributing gifts and high technology to those who traveled to it on the quantum bridge
in exchange for obedience to the priest class that represented the authority of Saturn. According to Plato's
testimony, Atlanteans may have attempted to conquer Earth at some point during the Golden Age. If they had any
success, this may explain why they would attempt to restore the memory of an Empire later in the dark ages.
Additionally, plato used the word 'insolent' which may suggest that the common people outside the
Atlantean/Monotheistic religion blamed the Atlanteans themselves for the end of the Golden Age, accusing them of
eating the forbidden fruit of the [Tree of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil)
and bringing down the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel).

### Atlantis falls creating the 'Deep' State

The period of stability that pervaded the Golden Age would suddenly come to an end. Each planet had been absorbing matter
and energy from the Sun growing in size throughout the Golden Age period. Eventually the planets become too large and
too energetic, and begin to oscillate violently in a new non-linear orbit beginning a long period of instability that
would come to define the *Dark Ages*. 
When Atlantis 'fell' into Saturn's plasma sheath (i.e. ocean), the existence of natural quantum gates passed out of
common knowledge, and became a *Deep State* secret.
The priests of the Atlantean religion did not understand why their primary God Saturn / El would punish them with
death and oblivion, but it wasn't God's punishment at all. Instead, being cast out
of the Garden of Eden was like a bird being pushed out of a nest by a parent - natural and necessary.

The priests on Earth who remained loyal to the religion of Atlantis
never forgot its fall and would continue to seek the reinstitution of God's authority throughout future history.
They sought to execute that authority over all other life forms, even over humans outside their society
(i.e. the gentiles) and established themselves within the courts of the highest levels of human society
forming the so-called **Deep State**. The religion of Atlantis would have to remain hidden well into modern times
until it can re-conquer the entire Earth. Only then would it be *safe* to reveal the 'true' history of Earth, slightly
rewritten to include the Atlanteans as the *heroes* of all of human history.

</PopImage>

### The Pyramidal Empire and the Exodus

Eventually Earth found itself in Jupiter's orbit, and this new "King" would bring stability to the cataclysm age.
It would again become possible for a quantum entanglement to occur between Earth and Mars. 
To survive the electric storms and cataclysmic debris, the humans built the pyramids (a form of ancient cathedral) along the
equatorial zones of the Earth and Mars where the amplitude of the strikes were greatest.
Building pyramids on these 'ley-line' locations would additionally re-enable the periodic quantum entanglements
between planets that terminated within the pyramid walls. This allowed the Atlantean priest class to once again
assume a rulership position over the rest of the species.

The Egyptian/Pyramidal empire lasted from 3147 B.C.E. until its fall in 1492 B.C.E.
when it was hit by a series of
[Plagues](https://www.vice.com/en/article/nz7neg/electric-universe-theory-thunderbolts-project-wallace-thornhill)
which were caused by Jupiter's ejecting of Venus.
Velikovsky interprets the 'Passover' of the Exodus as the passing of the Dragon/Comet/Planet Venus
very close to the Earth causing widespread cataclysm.

The *Exodus* story in the Old Testament was a real story about the first time the Deep State
lost control of the Earth/Mars gates due to shifting conditions within the Solar System. The story was later redacted
to exclude most humanity and add divine intervention. The first human-made Mars Gates were the Pyramids,
which exist all over the world.
The Egyptian 'slaves' weren't Jews, they were all humans on Earth, but mostly
humans in the Southern Hemisphere.

The religion of Ancient Egypt worshiped the Old Testament "Tri-form" God known as Osiris,
however, the *unforetold* passing of Venus proved their rulers did not represent God.
In "Moses and Monotheism", Sigmund Freud posits that Moses was of Egyptian royalty, rather than a 'Hebrew slave',
and it was the *priest* class and **not the slaves** that left the pyramids in the *Exodus*.
In Egyptian tradition of (Sun vs Set), Osiris (the old Sun) was killed by his brother Set, cut into many pieces, and scattered.
The story goes on that Venus dropped some kind of edible primordial carbohydrate material
onto the Earth that the Israelites of the Exodus lived off of for 40 years. 
This part of the story could have been redacted from the 18th-19th Century
during the Mudflood Energetic Event after the
Pugachev Rebellion 1774. The war resulted in 40 years of desert on earth,
and the causers of that war (humans on Mars) did seek out survivors to fill the reset cities (promised land).

### Monotheism set back by Crusades

In 1185 C.E. Monotheists, still clinging to the fallen Atlantean/Egyptian religion,
famously crucified Christ (a human giant), thinking his challenges against their
church would die with him. However, despite the crucifixion, the Christian revolution survived and even
gained momentum due to a successful Crusade launched in retaliation. 
According to the [New Chronology](https://chronologia.org/en/seven/history.html), 
Christ’s brother brought his body back from Istanbul to Crimea, followed by a congregation of smaller-sized
humans and became the first Tsar of Russia. 
The success of the 1196 C.E. Crusade laid the groundwork for the
Russian-Hordian Empire which destroyed the Church, and its Monotheistic doctrine.
The Hordian empire would honor **all** gods in defiance with the Church's First Commandment
and eventually expanded into a global empire until its fall in 1775.
In the version of the story found in Shingō Japan, Christ's brother died on the Cross
and Christ himself [survived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Jesus) to found the Empire.

### Monotheism defeats Christianity

In 1380 C.E., the same lineage of Giants that founded the Rus-Horde empire were defeated at the Battle of Kulikovo.
Giants of the Horde succumbed to the 'Marathon' cannon technology of the smaller humans of that same empire. 
In this battle, 'Royal' christianity was defeated by Apostolic Christianity that we know today (Canonization). 
This is the 2nd great war between giants and smaller sized humans. 
It was also the moment the Giants would lose all authority over the Rus-Horde Empire, and would become the 
permanent enemies of the Deep State, enslaved and/or eradicated.
In this battle, the metal cannons were used to defeat fully armored giant warriors. 
The giants gave up the fight after realizing the smaller humans had an undefeatable weapon. Apostolic Christianity 
and Judaism enshrined this moment as the story of David vs Goliath where David beats a giant using a 'sling'.

Regardless, 'Apostolic' Christianity was generally unconvincing to the world at large,
and had to be reasserted through many bloody
[Christian Crusades](https://www.differentspirit.org/resources/crusades.php).
Polytheism became Paganism and all tails of the Gods would be re-written as purely human stories.
Some examples are the stories of both King Arthur and Jesus Christ
which are [allegories](http://solarmythology.com/lessons/christ2002.htm) for the Sun appearing to earth,
creating the first Seasons.
Publishing redacted pagan beliefs through mass media was the Deep State's primary subterfuge for
controlling humanity through religion.

### Atlantean Empire re-emerges

By the 19th Century, the Deep State was beginning to resurface to the
public, having defeated nearly all of its enemies in the MudFlood Energetic Event.
[London](https://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/cleopatra-s-needle-story-behind-obelisks-007051)
had a huge Egyptian obelisk moved there from Alexandria in 1877. After the American Civil War, an Egyptian
obelisk was constructed by slaves in [Washington D.C.](https://www.thewrap.com/spider-man-homecoming-washington-monument/)
in 1884 to commemorate George Washington, the guy who fought a war against London, where the *other obelisk*
stands. Even though the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause) of the US Constitution
prohibits establishment of religious icons within the government,
a [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States) with
an '[All-seeing eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence)' appears throughout the federal government
and on all United States $1 dollar bills.
How could two countries at war both have the same Egyptian
[obelisk](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/washington-monument-built-egyptomaniacs-180961314/)?
Because the Deep State was funding, arming, and directing both sides of every major [war](/war) on Earth,
benefiting from its outcome.

Targeting [syncretism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_syncretism),
both wars split the world along existing religious lines, segregating the mixed religions and
once again slaughtering the pagans. In particular, Christianity, Islam, and Judaism became separate identities
even as they continue to share the Old Testament as their primary book source.
20th Century genocides such as the Great Depression, Holodomor and Holocaust, and African Genocides resulted in 
segregation of earth populations into controllable religious sects.

## Redactions of the "War of the Worlds"

The story "The War of the Worlds" was a real event that occurred on earth many times.
It was heavily redacted by plagiarist [H.G.Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Deeks) in the book War of the Worlds (1898).
Until Wells stepped in, nearly all fictitious and non-fiction accounts of "Men from Mars"
regarded Martians as human men (and women) as well as benign.

> "H. G. Wells. His determination (utopianist though he was) to use Mars not for reassuring utopian
> fantasies but as a scourge to human complacency resulted in 1898 in a path-breaking novel of interplanetary
invasion.
> The War of the Worlds, the first literary masterpiece in the tradition of Martian fiction,

One connection between this book and modern times is the U.S. Military's

This [crowd control vehicle](https://files.paradigmthreat.net/mars/heat_ray.jpg) has built upon it
a heat ray device that looks *precisely* like the heat ray described in the book:

"This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished
parabolic mirror of unknown composition".

and all [the movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_based_on_The_War_of_the_Worlds)
**cover-up** this design by switching the Heat Ray to a 'tall funnel'?
Because 'Heat-Ray' technology became a classified military secret in the 20th century. 
Realistic depictions of heat-ray technology would become suppressed.

Martians are *human*, like you and me. They aren't giant brains with octopus arms!
However, in the book they are described as such. Wells implies Martians somehow evolved over millions of years into
a far more primitive state. How could this be? We get a clue from another piece of predictive programming -
Independence Day (1996). In this movie, the *real* aliens are hidden within biomechanical host bodies
that do not resemble their actual appearance. The *host body* found in science fiction might have applied to the Wells book.
This would explain many things, like why the Martians do not appear to be human and how their bodies
could have survived the heat and impact of the physical travel between planets.

Martians live inside Mars, as all planets are Hollow, but life is difficult, food is scarce, and overpopulation
is an actual problem (unlike on Earth).
Contrary to programming, Martians are *not* smarter than Earthlings. 
Their early adoption of advanced technology was motivated by the scarcity in their environment 
and the need to control the flow of resources from Earth.

### Travel to Earth

Despite what we've seen on Star Trek and Star Wars, space travel via 'spaceship' is virtually impossible for
living beings. 
Earth's electro-magnetic field flows through our bodies and _keeps us alive_.
If we were to leave it, or get anywhere near the 'Van Allen Belts', we would die. Exposing one's self, or
space-ship to the Sun's EM field would mean certain death, regardless of size.
The only time it is safe to send a ship physically between planets is during opposition (every 26 months) when
Mars and Earth are joined by their extended EM fields. This creates a temporary tunnel of energy which protects
traveling craft and enables high-bandwidth communication. During each opposition,
the stock market [increases in activity](/mars/appendix_ares_le_mandat.pdf),
resources (human and otherwise) are transported, and remote-viewing (and control) is practiced.

Martians can also safely get to Earth via man-made Quantum Gates (like CERN) which only operate when the
planets are in opposition.
When Martians lose control over the gates, they lose control over Earth,
and they must use other means to reassert control remotely.

### Maintaining Control of Earth

Martians must also maintain strict loyalty within entire generations of humans here on Earth.
The Tripod Walker exists because the Martians need to hide their technology from Earth while attacking
it. Earthlings cannot build the Tripods themselves by observing them, as they lack the phenomenal electric power
required. In early versions of the War of the Worlds story, the Tripods show up and wipe out all living things with poison gas
while attempting to avoid destruction of infrastructure. The Martians then die of a disease (something they really
should have seen coming) and the story abruptly ends. The *real* story ends when the Tripods accomplished their
goal of disrupting a specific society, giving the insiders time to fill key positions of power before rebuilding
it again under the direct control of the *Deep State*. This may be why tripod incursions occur right before the major wars
of the last 2 centuries.

It's important to note that in the War of the Worlds story, the Tripods are observed taking away the remains of
their fallen comrades. Strategically, this is a bad idea as it leaves them open to a secondary strike.
The only reason they would do this is to hide the technology after the war is won,
leaving absolutely no trace of Tripods ever having been present. The survivors then get accused of
[Wartime PTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_pyramid_claims).

### Martian Tripod Incursions in Earth History

It seems that in every testimony of tripod incursions on Earth,
the event was followed by a major military conscription
in that same region, which then always leads directly to a major war.
The reason for the tripod incursion in London at the turn of the century was to
co-opt control of the British Isles and all of its world resources. By 1920,
the *British Empire* reached its greatest territorial extent.
There is a [statue of a Martian Tripod](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/martian-tripod.html)
in Woking town center, Surry, UK, one of the locations of these events.
In the U.S. East Coast, Orson
Wells [covered up](https://blog.newspapers.com/emwar-of-the-worlds-radio-scare-october-30-1938/)
yet another event involving Tripods.

The objective for the 1938 East Coast incursion was to conscript America and all of its world resources
into a world war against Russia. The American Empire reached its greatest territorial extent in 1945.
Science 'fiction' books have also depicted testimony of
[tripod incursions](https://marzaat.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/war-of-the-worlds-global-dispatches/)
in the Civil War times. In “Night of the Cooters”, Sheriff Lindley organizes a resistance against
a Martian cylinder that lands nearby.
It's possible the Civil War would not have been accomplished without first eliminating major pockets of resistance
across america.


## Peace is the Final Reset

Our dystopian reality will continue indefinitely unless two things happen. Firstly, the Humans of Earth need to get
their act together and figure out what's real and what's not, regardless of what the actual truth is,
and that could take a while as much of the world still adheres to the cult of Monotheism
and believes an invisible god intervenes in modern events and has a 'plan for us all'.
This 'plan' of-course, turned out to be the Deep State's - requiring endless war and human carnage,
and could not possibly be something a benign deity would plan.
Therefore, the other event that has to happen is lasting peace on Earth.
If either of these two conditions are not met, it is guaranteed that this situation will continue.
As Samuel Clemens might say, the Deep State can rule some of the people all the time,
all the people some of the time, but never *all the people all the time*.
The Deep State has victimized humanity for thousands of years, but if peace is achieved on Earth then
all is forgiven. Humans on Mars may fear retribution, much like the Zionists fear retribution by Palestinians.
There won't be any. We already know how to share our resources.
There will be no scarcity (Malthusian theory was wrong, sorry Thanos!).
Mars will keep getting lovely supplies shipped from Earth.
They'll finally allow us to use advanced technology and give up their control, and peace will finally overcome
our **God of War**: The Planet Mars.
