## Question by xcitable1

> xcitable1: Listened to the THC podcast.  Definitely some thought provoking info, my main question is why would Mars humans remain on Mars if they need our resources?  If they are able to use portals, etc they could all just come here.  Unless there is more to the story

> protricity: another excellent question! I believe the Deep State resides in all the secret places of the world and solar system - wherever they can get to. Also the NAZIs seem to have evacuated to several locations including Hollow Earth. So the geopolitical map of our solar system is checkered between the two forces that fought WW2.
> People on Mars end up being no different from anywhere else, but they may have 2 motives that set them apart from us on Earth:
> 1. Scarcity of resources - they have serious problems with water being only available half of the year (a Mars year is 687 days on earth). Apparently they don't grow or eat much meat. So they live a very limited lifestyle and would *love to come here.
> 2. Early technology - in order to survive in regions that are completely uninhabitable, the Martians would have needed to build advanced technology up to 1000 years ago around the time of the last cataclysms.

> So I believe, as a result of the cruel life they lived up there over the centuries, they were doing everything they could to come here - but they needed our help to build safe portals and even cities and towers where they would be safe to live in.
> Unfortunately, since they attempted to mind control this planet via religion and led us to endless wars, we've hit a stalemate. Their plans seem to have failed, and now they are executing plan B.
> One of the features of the mRNA vaccine is it it makes our blood more like theirs - reducing our immune system, fertility, and making them and their future generations competitive with ours. Hard to imagine? I agree.

> Here's a quote from War of the Worlds which I think accurately describes Mars of the 19th century. Note that even Wells believed there were oceans on the surface of mars:
> "The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter. Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas."

> I've recently concluded that Mars and Mercury were originally formed from the Earth itself during the collinear configuration. 
> Neither are viable planets. 
> They are both primordial left-overs :sob:
