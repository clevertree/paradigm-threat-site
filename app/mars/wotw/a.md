Recorded incursions from the other planet in our solar system with lots of humans - Mars - has been recorded in London,
Spain, and America. They occurred roughly around the turn of the century in order to prepare these locations for WW1.
The same event was necessary in the East Coast to prepare America for WW2. Tens of thousands of people fled the cities.
Those who remained behind were gassed. Due to the spread of technology in America at the time, we were able to record it
and broadcast it live via radio. Typically, leaks should not happen like this, but since it did, they had no choice but
to use their `Revelation Of The Method` strategy and claim the whole radio broadcast was 'science fiction' nothing more
than a Halloween episode of the radio series The Mercury Theatre on the Air directed and narrated by Orson Welles about
a martian invasion.

## Differences between "The War of the Worlds" the book/movie/album and the real event:

The story "The War of the Worlds" was a real event that occurred on earth many times,
but heavily redacted by plagiarist [H.G. Welles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Deeks).
Until Wells stepped in, nearly all fictitious and non-fiction accounts of "Men from Mars"
regarded Martians as 1\. Human men (and women) and 2\. Benign.  
"H. G. Wells. His determination (utopianist though he was) to use Mars not for reassuring utopian
fantasies but as a scourge to human complacency resulted in 1898 in a path-breaking novel of interplanetary invasion.
The War of the Worlds, the first literary masterpiece in the tradition of Martian fiction,
upends the sentimental icon of the man from Mars and replaces him with monstrous would-be
conquerors who give British imperialists a taste of their own medi-cine."

### The Martian Heat Ray

The most obvious connection between this book and modern times is the U.S. Military's
[Active Denial System](https://healthimpactnews.com/2017/can-new-5g-technology-and-smart-meters-be-used-as-weapons/).
This [crowd control vehicle](https://files.paradigmthreat.net/mars/heat_ray.jpg) has built upon it
a heat ray device that looks **precisely** like the heat ray described in the book:


<img src="/mars/wotw_technology_heat_ray.jpg" alt="The Martian Heat Ray | The U.S. Military Active Denial System" />

"This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic
mirror of unknown composition"
Why did the [WotW album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Wayne%27s_Musical_Version_of_The_War_of_the_Worlds)
and all [the movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_based_on_The_War_of_the_Worlds)
**cover this design up** by switching the Heat Ray to a 'tall funnel'?
Because 'Heat-Ray' technology became a classified military secret in the 20th century. Realist depictions of heat-ray
technology would become forbidden.

### Martian Appearance

Martians are definitely human, like you and me. They aren't giant brains with octopus arms!
Martians live inside Mars, as all planets are Hollow, but life is difficult, food is scarce, and overpopulation is an
actual problem (unlike on Earth).
Martians are **not** smarter than Earthlings. Their early adoption of advanced technology was motivated by the scarcity
in their environment
and their need to control the flow of resources from Earth.

### Travel to Earth

Martians can only safely get to Earth via natural or man-made Quantum Gates (CERN) which only operate when the planets
are in opposition (every 26 months).
No living creature could survive space travel in a small cylinder, nor can it survive a comet-like re-entry burn,
nor can it survive for days inside scalding metal.
**But a remote-controlled machine can!**
When Martians lose control over the gates, they lose control over Earth,
and they must use other means to re-assert control remotely.
Martians **cannot** travel between planets on cylinders, but they can send robots through space,
and remote-control robots on Earth.

### Maintaining Control of Earth

Tripods are not enough! Martians must also maintain strict loyalty within entire generations of secret societies here on
Earth.

The Tripod Walker exists because the Martians need to hide their technology from Earth while attacking it.
Earthlings cannot build the Tripods themselves by observing them, as they lack the phenomenal electric power required.
In early versions of the WotW story, the Tripods show up and route all the civilians into one location while attempting
to avoid destruction of infrastructure. They then die of a disease, something they really should have seen coming, and
the story ends. The **real** story ends when the Tripods accomplished their goal of disrupting a specific society,
giving
the insiders time to fill key positions of power before rebuilding it again. It's important to note that in *ALL*
versions
of the WotW story, the Tripods are observed taking away the remains of their fallen comrades.
Strategically, this is a bad idea as it leaves them open to a secondary strike.
The only reason they would do this is to hide the technology after the war is won,
leaving absolutely no trace of Tripods ever having been present. The survivors then get accused of
[Wartime PTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_pyramid_claims).

### Martian Tripod Incursions in Earth History

There is a [statue of a Martian Tripod](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/martian-tripod.html)
in Woking town center, Surry, UK, one of the locations of these events.
In The States, we had the Orson
Welles [cover up](https://blog.newspapers.com/emwar-of-the-worlds-radio-scare-october-30-1938/)
of yet another event involving Tripods. "Once they start to move, no more news comes out of that area".
Also in the States, we
have ["Science Fiction"](https://marzaat.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/war-of-the-worlds-global-dispatches/)
books depicting a history of Tripods in the Civil War Times. "“Night of the Cooters” 1987,
Howard Waldrop describes "Sheriff Lindley organizes a resistance against a Martian cylinder that lands nearby."

## Quotes from the Redacted Book

"Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance.
The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges,
the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth,
the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere,
the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth—above all,
the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes—were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.
There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements
unspeakably nasty.
Even at this first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread."

"Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass that framed them,
the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes,
the lipless brim of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively.
A lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air."

"I think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men,
but in all essentials a man. I know I did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the shadow:
greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks—like eyes.
Then something resembling a little grey snake, about the thickness of a walking stick,
coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another."

"It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently.
Many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute
non-conductivity.
This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose,
by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition,
much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these details.
However, it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter.
Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light. Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch,
lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes
into steam."

"The Martians and their appliances were altogether invisible, save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror
wobbled"

"The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence.
Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few
fugitives,
with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being.
A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case,
...and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray."

"Only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the Heat-Ray saved them.
Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale.
They saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the bushes as it hurried towards them
through the twilight.
Then, with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung close over their heads,
lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows,
firing the window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner"

## The Spinster and the Prophet: H.G. Wells, Florence Deeks, and the Case of the Plagiarized Text Kindle Edition

When, in 1920, Florence Deeks finally received her rejected manuscript a feminist history of the world from Macmillan
after eight months, she couldn't understand why it appeared in such bad condition, the pages worn, torn and dog-eared.
Later that year, when she read H.G. Wells's new book, The Outline of History, published by Macmillan, she felt a chill.
There were so many similarities to her own work: shared themes, organization, word choice, even the same mistakes.
Florence made a dramatic decision she would sue Wells and his publisher for plagiarism. Years later, after a series of
failed appeals, this reserved, dignified Toronto woman tried to bring her case to the king of England. It is a
compelling story, part mystery, part legal thriller, always sympathetic to the intrepid Deeks, a woman trying to get a
fair hearing in a man's world. McKillop's narrative directly challenges earlier accounts of Deeks v. Wells, which were
all too eager to paint the plaintiff as a frustrated, obsessed spinster. The result is a wonderfully complex portrait of
the two protagonists: Deeks, a shy, earnest, lionhearted woman; Wells, a bold, sexually promiscuous literary giant. The
author handles the dual story line brilliantly, weaving together two opposing characters into one altogether gripping
tale of literary theft. Photos. (Oct. 1) Forecast: Short-listed for several Canadian prizes and warmly received in
Britain, this should be widely reviewed here and will appeal to readers of literary history and of women's history and,
more broadly, to the kind of readers who flocked to The Professor and the Madman.

## [Great Men Who Built Their Careers on Plagiarism](https://www.cracked.com/article_17198_5-great-men-who-built-their-careers-plagiarism.html)

"It's not enough for Wells to just profit of off the stolen property; the original author needed to be crushed.

"Which she was. Deeks sued of course, but, this being 1920 and Wells being a man with a glorious mustache, her suit
failed and H.G. was exonerated.

"Of course not. No one even believed he was guilty for decades. Wells continued to write bestselling novels and change
the face of both radio and literature forever. Deeks died poor, unloved and bitter.

"Then, years after both of their deaths, A.B. McKillop of Carleton University published a study on the allegations
against Wells. "The Spinster and the Prophet: H.G. Wells, Florence Deeks, and the Case of the Plagiarized Text" made a
compelling case against Wells. By which we mean it proved he was a plagiarizing fuck.

"War On Plagiarism.org sums the whole situation up well: "H.G. Wells' plagiarism stands as one of the 20th Century's
most blatant instances of personal economic gain as a result of unacknowledged derivation and usurpation of another
author's text."

"In our own words, we'd just like to say that the plagiarism committed by H.G. Wells stands as one of last century's
blatantest instances of personal money gain as a result of unacknowledged derivation and usurpation of another author's
text, and we think it's shameful.
