While there has been recent criticism of those taking the position that Israel is committing genocide against
Palestinians, there is a long history of human rights scholarship and legal analysis that supports the assertion.
Prominent scholars of the international law crime of genocide and human rights authorities take the position that
Israel’s policies toward the Palestinian people could constitute a form of genocide. Those policies range from the 1948
mass killing and displacement of Palestinians to a half-century of military occupation and, correspondingly, the
discriminatory legal regime governing Palestinians, repeated military assaults on Gaza, and official Israeli statements
expressly favoring the elimination of Palestinians.

Genocide is a term that has both sociological and legal meaning. The term genocide was coined in 1944 by a Jewish Polish
legal scholar, Raphael Lemkin. For Lemkin, “the term does not necessarily signify mass killings.” He explained:

**More often [genocide] refers to a coordinated plan aimed at destruction of the essential foundations of the life of
national groups so that these groups wither and die like plants that have suffered a blight**. The end may be
accomplished by the forced disintegration of political and social institutions, of the culture of the people, of their
language, their national feelings and their religion. It may be accomplished by wiping out all basis of personal
security, liberty, health and dignity. When these means fail the machine gun can always be utilized as a last resort.
Genocide is directed against a national group as an entity and the attack on individuals is only secondary to the
annihilation of the national group to which they belong.[[1]](#_ftn1)

Since Lemkin’s first invocation of the term, it has gained political, social, and legal meaning. For political
scientists, historians, and sociologists, genocide is “understood as a major type of collective violence, with a
distinctive place in the spectrum of political violence, armed conflict, and war, of which it is usually seen as a
part.”[[2]](#_ftn2)

From a legal perspective, genocide, like the crime against humanity of persecution, is an international crime
distinguished by the specific intent to discriminate against a group on recognized grounds through a series of acts or
omissions often reflected in and achieved through State policies. While different in degree, both genocide and
persecution “[reduce] a person to their identification with or membership in a group,” but also “[attack] the group
itself.”[[3]](#_ftn3) Persecution criminalizes the denial of fundamental rights for members of the group, and genocide
criminalizes the most extreme stage of discrimination: efforts to actually destroy the group.

According to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,[[4]](#_ftn4) genocide includes
various acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” as
such, including:

(a) Killing members of the group;

(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole
or in part; and

(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.[[5]](#_ftn5)

This definition is reflected in Article 6 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has
jurisdiction over crimes occurring on the territory of the State of Palestine since June 13, 2014.[[6]](#_ftn6)

The Genocide Convention was written in the aftermath of World War II and the horrors of the Holocaust, especially to
deter and prevent such horrors in the future and, failing that, to punish those responsible. The Convention thus
provided a legal framework that clearly identifies the essence of the crime of genocide, regardless of the political,
social, or cultural permutations in which the crime may be attempted or carried out and regardless of the specific
qualities, stage, or scale of the genocidal process. The Holocaust set the terms by which a form of general or pervasive
violence against a group might be legitimately termed “genocide” as a general sociological concept as it need not “imply
a comparison to any other specific case.”[[7]](#_ftn7)

Scholars of genocide have distinguished it as a crime different from other forms of war, killing, violence,
discrimination, and repression. “Genocidal action aims not just to contain, control, or subordinate a population, but to
shatter and break up its social existence. Thus genocide is defined, not by a particular form of violence, but by
general and pervasive violence.”[[8]](#_ftn8) They note that settler colonial regimes are structurally prone to
genocide, and may indulge in “genocidal moments” when they become frustrated by the resistance of a colonized or
occupied people.[[9]](#_ftn9)

The term “genocide” has been used to describe the mass murder of Armenians by the Ottomans, Stalin’s expulsion of
Chechens, Ingush Tartars, and Jews from the U.S.S.R., the removal of Jews and Hungarians from Romania, and Italy’s
efforts to clear Slovenes and Croats from the Dalmatian coast.[[10]](#_ftn10) There have been successful prosecutions of
individuals for genocide arising out of efforts to destroy the Tutsi population in Rwanda in 1994[[11]](#_ftn11) and
Srebrenica in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995.[[12]](#_ftn12)

Numerous prominent human rights authorities, advocates, and scholars have claimed that Israel’s policies and actions
with respect to the Palestinian people have amounted to a form of genocide.

**Expulsion and Killing of Palestinians in 1948**

With respect to the creation of the Israeli state in 1948, there has been a robust scholarly debate about whether the
settlement of Jews and the expulsion of Palestinians in Mandate Palestine could be described as genocide. Sociologist
Martin Shaw, one of the most distinguished modern scholars of genocide, has written, “We can conclude that pre-war
Zionism included the development of an _incipiently genocidal mentality_ towards Arab society.”[[13]](#_ftn13) “Israel
entered without an overarching plan, so that its specific genocidal thrusts developed situationally and incrementally,
through local as well as national decisions. On this account, this was a partly decentred, networked genocide,
developing in interaction with the Palestinian and Arab enemy, in the context of war.”[[14]](#_ftn14)

In 2010, the Journal of Genocide Studies hosted a conversation between Martin Shaw and another prominent scholar of
genocide, Omer Bartov, on whether the term “genocide” could be reasonably applied to the Israeli treatment of
Palestinians, particularly the expulsion and killing of Arabs in 1948.[[15]](#_ftn15) The two scholars took very
different positions on the question, but the journal rejected complaints from some quarters that it was an illegitimate,
or worse, a bigoted question to pose and debate at all.[[16]](#_ftn16)

Francis Boyle, a professor of international law, testified in 2013 that “The Palestinians have been the victims of
genocide as defined by the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.”[[17]](#_ftn17) He
argued that:

For over the past six and one-half decades, the Israeli government and its predecessors in law – the Zionist agencies,
forces, and terrorist gangs – have ruthlessly implemented a systematic and comprehensive military, political, religious,
economic, and cultural campaign with the intent to destroy in substantial part the national, ethnical, racial, and
different religious group (Jews versus Muslims and Christians) constituting the Palestinian people.[[18]](#_ftn18)

**Long-Term Military Occupation of Palestinian People**

When the international community ratified legal rules that would regulate the actions of occupying powers while also
protecting the rights of occupied peoples and nations/states, it was understood that military occupation would be a
short-lived necessity attendant to armed conflict, and that occupying forces would be withdrawn at the end of the
conflict.[[19]](#_ftn19) Israel’s prolonged belligerent occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza
for 50 years far exceeds the kind of occupation that animated the creation of legal rules of occupation contained in
international law. Given the seemingly permanent nature of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, some human
rights experts, including Israeli historian Ilan Pappé, have warned of an “incremental genocide” of Palestinians and the
ultimate destruction of Palestinians as a national group.[[20]](#_ftn20) This “incremental genocide” through the
policies and practices that have both sustained and served as the hallmarks of Israel’s occupation is accomplished, they
argue, by a normalization of the Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory and the exile or absorption of the national
group of people who identify as Palestinian. International law is clear that an occupying power may not annex the people
or territory it occupies.[[21]](#_ftn21)

The late human rights lawyer and Center for Constitutional Rights Board President Michael Ratner also charged Israel
with committing “incremental genocide” against the Palestinian people: “There’s no doubt again here this is ‘incremental
genocide,’ as Ilan Pappé says. It’s been going on for a long time, the killings, the incredibly awful conditions of
life, the expulsions that have gone on from Lydda in 1947 and ‘48, when 700 or more villages in Palestine were
destroyed, and in the expulsions that continued from that time until today. It’s correct and important to label it for
what it is.”[[22]](#_ftn22) He argued further, “I want to emphasize today [that] these killings are part of a broader
set of inhuman acts by Israel constituting international crimes, carried out by Israel over many years, going back to at
least 1947 and 1948\. They include crimes that aren’t talked about that much in the media or the press, the crimes of
genocide, crimes against humanity, and apartheid. These crimes can be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court and
are defined there.”[[23]](#_ftn23)

The Russell Tribunal on Palestine, a nongovernmental “people’s body” made up of prominent international human rights
experts and advocates, convened between November 2010 and September 2014 to investigate the question of human rights
violations in the context of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza.[[24]](#_ftn24)
It took testimony and deliberated specifically on the question of whether Israel may have committed genocide in relation
to the Palestinian people. The jury concluded that some Israeli citizens and leaders may have been guilty in several
instances of the separate crime of _incitement_ to genocide, which is specified in Article 3(c) of the Genocide
Convention. “The cumulative effect of the long-standing regime of collective punishment in Gaza appears to inflict
conditions of life calculated to bring about the incremental destruction of the Palestinians as a group in Gaza. The
Tribunal emphasises the potential for a regime of persecution to become genocidal in effect.”[[25]](#_ftn25)

**Military Assaults on Gazan Population**

With respect to Israel’s most recent military offensive, the so-called “Operation Protective Edge” launched against Gaza
in the summer of 2014, prominent human rights authorities expressed concern that the campaign constituted a violation of
international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Conventions:

* Amnesty International issued a statement proclaiming “an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation is essential
  to break the culture of impunity which perpetuates the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel
  and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The case for such action is made all the more compelling in the light of the
  ongoing serious violations of international humanitarian law being committed by all parties to the current hostilities
  in the Gaza Strip and Israel.”[[26]](#_ftn26)
* The ICC has jurisdiction over genocide, and the U.N. Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide issued a statement
  two weeks into the 2014 offensive that they were “disturbed by the flagrant use of hate speech in the social media,
  particularly against the Palestinian population,” finding that “individuals have disseminated messages that could be
  dehumanising to the Palestinians and have called for the killing of members of this group,” while “remind[ing] all
  that incitement to commit atrocity crimes is prohibited under international law.”[[27]](#_ftn27)
* Al-Haq, the oldest Palestinian Human Rights organization, found that serious violations of international law were
  committed in the course of the 2014 Israeli offensive against Gaza.[[28]](#_ftn28) Al-Haq, along with other
  Palestinian human rights organizations the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, Al-Mezan, and Aldameer, submitted a
  legal file to the International Criminal Court urging it to open an investigation and prosecution into the crimes
  against humanity and war crimes committed during the course of Israel’s 2014 Gaza offensive.[[29]](#_ftn29) The crimes
  suggested for prosecution by these human rights organizations include genocide.
* Dozens of Holocaust survivors, together with hundreds of descendants of Holocaust survivors and victims, accused
  Israel of “genocide” for the deaths of more than 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza during the 2014 Israeli military offensive
  against Gaza, "Operation Protective Edge". [[30]
* Others who have charged that Israel committed genocide during Operation Cast Lead include Bolivian President Evo
  Morales, who recalled that country's ambassador from Israel. He stated, “What is happening in Palestine is
  genocide.”[[31]
* Author and activist Naomi Wolf wrote, “I mourn genocide in Gaza because I am the granddaughter of a family half wiped
  out in a holocaust and I know genocide when I see it.”[[32]

**Israeli Government Statements Targeting Palestinians**

Finally, prominent Israeli politicians have publicly called for action against the Palestinian people that unequivocally
meets the definition of genocide under the 1948 Convention. For instance, in February 2008, Matan Vilnai, Israel’s
deputy defense minister, declared that increasing tensions between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip could
bring on themselves what he called a _shoah_, or holocaust, “The more Qassam [rocket] fire intensifies and the rockets
reach a longer range, they will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah because we will use all our might to defend
ourselves.”[[33]](#_ftn33)

Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked posted a statement on Facebook in June 2014 claiming that “the entire Palestinian
people is the enemy” and called for the destruction of Palestine, “including its elderly and its women, its cities and
its villages, its property and its infrastructure.” Her post also called for the killing of Palestinian mothers who give
birth to “little snakes.”[[34]](#_ftn34)

In August 2014, Moshe Feiglin, then-deputy speaker of the Israeli Knesset and member of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s ruling Likud Party, called for the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza and offered a detailed plan for
shipping Palestinians living in Gaza across the world. Specifically, he envisioned a scenario where the Israeli Defense
Forces (IDF) would find areas on the Sinai border to establish “tent encampments...until relevant emigration
destinations are determined.” He further suggested that the IDF would then “exterminate nests of resistance, in the
event that any should remain.”[[35]](#_ftn35) He subsequently wrote in an op-ed, “After the IDF completes the
‘softening’ of the targets with its fire-power, the IDF will conquer the entire Gaza, using all the means necessary to
minimize any harm to our soldiers, with no other considerations.”[[36]](#_ftn36) He continued, “Gaza is part of our Land
and we will remain there forever. Liberation of parts of our land forever is the only thing that justifies endangering
our soldiers in battle to capture land. Subsequent to the elimination of terror from Gaza, it will become part of
sovereign Israel and will be populated by Jews. This will also serve to ease the housing crisis in Israel. The coastal
train line will be extended, as soon as possible, to reach the entire length of Gaza.”

**Conclusion**

Prominent human rights advocates and scholars have argued that the killings of Palestinians and their forceful expulsion
from mandate Palestine in 1948, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, and the violence and
discrimination directed at Palestinians by the Israeli government have violated a number of human rights protections
contained in international human rights law, genocide being among them.
