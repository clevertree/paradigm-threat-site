## THE PATH OUT OF POVERTY BEGINS WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE STOP GETTING VACCINATED, ACCESS SAFE HEALTHCARE, AND LEARN HOW AND WHY SOCIAL ENGINEERING BY THE “PHARMA-MEDIA” IS GENOCIDAL

In developing countries, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation represents “Deep State” banking and drug industry
interests. They focus on undermining people’s health and well-being, effectively enslaving people to drugs, crisis
capitalism, and war commerce. People cannot lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty under these impositions.
In the United States, these devil-doers are working hard to sicken and enslave especially those with the fewest
resources—especially in the African-American communities—to preclude access to the opportunities people need to succeed
in school and life.

## EMPOWER THE POOREST ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN, TO STOP GETTING POISONED

THAT BY GIVING PEOPLE THE NATURAL HEALTH KNOWLEDGE AND SELF-CARE SKILLS TO LEAD HEALTHIER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE LIVES, WE
CAN END POVERTY.
Every year, millions of people find ways to transition out of poverty—by adopting new farming technologies, investing in
new business opportunities, or finding new jobs. We know women and girls have been especially repressed by our
patriarchal CULTure. Male domination destroys societies with fear by force and aggression, not kindness and
intelligence. Other species may kill for food, but never for profit or egocentrism. When you invest in a more
“conscious” life, health and empowerment results and has a ripple effect, helping others, their families, communities,
and countries, achieve long-lasting benefits.

WE CAN SAVE LIVES BY DELIVERING THE TRUTH IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO REFUTE THE CORPORATE AND SO CALLED
“PHILANTHROPIC” LIES JUSTIFYING “VACCINECIDE.”
The “slash, burn and poison” approach to “healthcare” is outdated and barbaric. This ongoing genocide results from
“modern medicine.” The truth be known, this mass murder and disease industry is targeting billions of unwitting
citizens. Alternatively, we are improving people’s well being naturally–bio-energetically! New vaccine-substitutes,
holistic health services and energy technologies are healing and uplifting humanity spiritually where it matters most.
This activity is fundamentally frequency-based “energy medicine.” 528Radio.com and OxySilver are great examples of this
victory over medical genocides. Such risk-free opportunities can help terminate infectious diseases worldwide naturally
and inexpensively.

At the same time these frequency based products and services protect the environment against poisonous antibiotics,
mercury, aluminum and other heavy metal toxins. These “meds” are like biological weapons for conducting war against
biology. That is, “anti-biology.” Support our work and safeguard your health. Check out “The Bill & Melinda Gates
Doomsday Package Special” to order OxySilver by the case for family and friends’ protection.

## [The Covid-19 Vaccine and the U.S. policy of depopulation](https://new.finalcall.com/2020/12/08/the-covid-19-vaccine-and-the-u-s-policy-of-depopulation/)

If you have difficulty believing that killing Original people is actually policy, not just random violence, then ask
yourself how we can trust the makers and administrators of the Covid-19 vaccine when U.S. laws protect them from
liability for injury or death caused by the vaccine?

The largest lobby in Washington, D.C. is the pharmaceutical industry. It owns both parties. It should not surprise us
that the government wasted no time giving these companies immunity from lawsuits over injuries and death caused by
medical countermeasures for Covid-19:   vaccines, therapeutics and respiratory devices (ventilators). It goes so far as
to prevent anyone harmed by a Coronavirus vaccine from using the 1986 Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to seek some
little relief from the government. This blanket protection under the PREP Act went into effect February 4, 2020, before
most of the public was even aware of Covid-19. The World Health Organization did not declare Covid-19 a pandemic until
one month later, on March 11. Dr. Ameet Sarpatwari of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School called the
action “an extreme departure from the norms.”

In the vaccine debate with Attorney Alan Dershowitz earlier this year, Attorney Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. offered this
fact: “Vaccines are zero liability…this is an industry that went to Congress in 1996. (They) had a vaccine at that time
that was causing brain injury in 1 out of 300 people … they said to Congress, ‘we cannot make vaccines safe, they are
unavoidably unsafe … the only reason we continue to make vaccines is if you give us a complete blanket immunity from
liability.’ Congress gave it to them. Today, if you have a product and it injures you, no matter how negligent the
company was, no matter how sloppy the protocols, no matter how toxic the ingredients, no matter now grievous your
injury, you cannot sue that company; that company has no incentive to make that product safe. That should be troubling
to any of us who are part of the legal system saying ‘we are going to force people to take this intervention.’”

The first Covid-19 vaccine to reach the market will be one completely unalike any before. Developed by Pfizer/BioNTech
and Moderna is new mRNA technology, never before approved for use in humans in the United States; “m” is for Messenger.
This vaccine does not have the coronavirus in it. Instead, it instructs your body to make the Covid-19 spike protein.
Once injected, you create a threat to yourself and then go to war against the threat you created. This is deliberate
manipulation of the very core of our biological makeup. This vaccine has a very real potential to alter who and what we
are.

Room. Corona Virus Prevention, Cure And Medication Concept. Selective Focus
In a recent interview with Sister Charlene Muhammad, national correspondent for The Final Call, renowned biochemist Dr.
Judy Mikovits, who has been maligned and vilified for exposing the medical industry, explained some of the effects the
mRNA vaccine will have on a population already injured from previous vaccines and weakened immune systems:

“The expression of this mRNA is literally the spike protein from two deadly retroviruses that are in our own viral
gnomes. We have been using aborted fetal tissue and other vaccines. When you add this mRNA vaccine, you are literally
putting the blueprint into every cell of the body and you are making this highly pathogenic (disease-causing) protein.
You will kill people who are already compromised and you will sterilize young women who get this vaccine.”

She emphasized that the real coronavirus enters a limited number of cells, those which have receptors for the spike
protein. But the mRNA “is expressing abnormally into every cell of the body. “This is very, very dangerous, because what
that spike protein has in it is the binding protein of the retrovirus HIV.”

No truthful person would call this experimental vaccine “safe and effective.” The vaccine requires two doses:  one to
prime the body; a few weeks later, another one to boost the response. It normally takes 5-15 years to develop a vaccine
because years are needed to realize the long-term effects. The Covid-19 vaccine is completely experimental. Worse, it
comes after 20 years of 100 percent failure in the effort to create a coronavirus vaccine. It is important to understand
Moderna is a biotech company that bases drug and vaccine development exclusively on Messenger RNA. They insert a
synthetic mRNA into human cells to reprogram them. Pfizer, though a pharmaceutical company, has partnered with a biotech
company to produce this vaccine.

As powerful multi-national corporations, subsidized by the U.S. government, move quickly to put needles and patches with
microneedles in arms, we have a crisis in our community that may be more of a threat to our survival than the virus
itself:   the aggressive campaign to persuade Black people to submit themselves to clinical trials and to the vaccine
itself. What is so horrifying is the enlistment of Black medical and health professionals, educators, politicians and
preachers to be the mouthpiece for the government; the mouthpiece for that which Minister Farrakhan identifies as “the
very representative of death itself.”

"When the postmortem is done on the media’s coverage of COVID-19 (and it will be), it will be clear that the virus was
no Black Plague — it’s not even the flu on a bad year.

"SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has killed 56,749 Americans as of Tuesday.

"That’s not good. But it’s not as bad as the 2017-2018 flu season, when 80,000 -plus perished. And it’s a long cry from
what all the experts were warning about just a few weeks ago: First, they predicted 1.7 million Americans dead; then
they redid the models (this time apparently entering a few more “facts”) and said 100,000-240,000 dead.

"Now, a major model relied on by the White House Coronavirus Task Force predicts about 70,000 dead by the end of August.

"And for that we shut down the U.S. economy?!

"As the coronavirus swept across China, then Europe — then everywhere — the U.S. media breathlessly reported every
terrifying number, almost gleefully. Their ratings soared, of course, as they scared the hell out of every American,
many of whom have stayed home for the last 40 days, emerging only to buy toilet paper, but even then clad in masks and
tiptoeing in fear.

"But here are some facts:

* Fatality Rate
    * A recent Stanford University antibody study estimated the fatality rate from the virus is likely 0.1% to 0.2%. The
      World Health Organization (WHO) had estimated that the death rate was 20 to 30 times higher and called for
      isolation policies. On which version do you think the media focused?
    * In New York City, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, the death rate for people 18 to 45 years old is 0.01%, or 10
      per 100,000 in the population. People aged 75 and older, though, have a death rate 80 times that. For children
      under 18, the rate of death is zero per 100,000. That’s zero.
* Health and Age
    * More than half of the COVID-19 deaths in Europe occurred in long-term care or nursing-home facilities. At least
      one-fifth of the deaths recorded in the U.S. so far have occurred there.
    * Nearly all the patients hospitalized for the coronavirus in New York City had underlying health conditions,
      according to a recent study.
    * “Health records from 5,700 patients hospitalized within the Northwell Health system — which housed the most
      patients in the country throughout the pandemic — showed that 94 percent of patients had more than one disease
      other than COVID-19, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association,” Fox News reported.
    * The study found 42% of the patients were overweight and 53% had hypertension, and the others suffered from a
      variety of ailments.

• Far More Widespread

"Millions and millions of Americans have already been infected with the virus — even though the U.S. media continues to
report the low numbers provided by Johns Hopkins, which says that 998,000 Americans have contracted the virus as of
Tuesday.

"An antibody study was conducted last week in New York City and found that 1 in 5 (21.2%) of residents have already been
infected with the coronavirus. There are 8.5 million people in New York City, so that would mean 1.8 million New Yorkers
have had the virus.

"At the time of the study, there were 16,249 deaths in the city attributed to COVID-19, which means the death rate in
the city was 0.89% at the time — far lower than reports in the U.S. media.

"Results of antibody survey last week in Los Angeles found as many as 442,000 Los Angeles County residents might have
already been infected with the coronavirus by early April, a number far higher than the 8,000 cases confirmed at the
time. The survey suggested that the death rate from the virus could be as low as 0.18% of COVID-19 patients, which means
the actual death rate in the city is far lower than reported.

"The Daily Mail reported Monday that “coronavirus may kill 70 times fewer patients than official UK death figures
suggest, studies have shown.” The Mail said a similar fatality rate — 0.19% — was found in a study of residents in
Helsinki, Finland.

"A study, this one by Dr. Justin Silverman, estimates that there were 8.7 million coronavirus infections in the U.S.
between March 8 and March 28. And as of April 17, 10% of Americans have been infected — which is roughly 33 million
Americans.

"The media has been hyping COVID-19 since Day One, alarming Americans to the point where they voluntarily went along
with shutting down the entire economy — a mistake that will likely reverberate for a decade or more.

"Even as U.S. states begin to re-open — based on the data, which shows a far lower fatality rate than reported and a
much wider spread of the virus — the media continue to report on what they deem frightening numbers over the deadly
virus.

"They aren’t, and it isn’t. COVID-19 is a bad flu at worst. And the media should be held accountable for telling us
otherwise before they knew the facts.
