## [Yōsei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dsei)

The house spirits Zashiki warashi, are described as being the size of a five or six-year-old child and prone to playing
harmless pranks and occasionally causing mischief.
Yōsei (Japanese: 妖精, lit. "bewitching spirit") is a Japanese word that is generally synonymous with the English term
fairy (フェアリー). Today, this word usually refers to spirits from Western legends, but occasionally it may also denote
a creature from native Japanese folklore. For example, according to an old folk belief from Iwate Prefecture, it was
once feared that the yōsei could bring the dead back to life. It is also mentioned that the people of Mt. Hōrai are
small fairies that have no knowledge of great evil and so their hearts never grow old. The Ainu also tell of a race of
small people known as the Koro-pok-guru in their folklore. Another fairy-like being from Japan is the Kijimuna, tree
sprites told in the Ryukyuan religion of Okinawa.
