Giants were notoriously difficult to convert into Monotheism.
They had their own religions, (large)
bibles, and were often followed by a significant congregation of normal-sized humans. The Deep State knew they would
never rule world religions as long as the Giants existed. If they could only eliminate them all - then normal-sized
humans would fall under the influence of Deep State religions
